- - That s why I will break things . He likes to beat opponents at their own game and that would literally be the most humiliating loss for DC

  - I mean  who drinks in their video 
- - How much of an affect does a triple option have on a defense  Does it tire you down  or are you used to whats being called

- - That Terminator ... I just ... dunno man . I just do nt know .
  - It s too ... clean . You would think a Terminator would get SOME blood on it after slaughtering all of man .
- - While you re right  there s still the undeniable fact that the Bible condones slavery in a few passages .
  - I could be mistaken but I do believe it both condones and supports the taking of slaves depending on what verse and what kind of spin you care to use .
- - Good luck on the non-smoking journey . TIL about Daiya jalapeno cheese . I m going to try this recipe 
  - make sure to post your results  and do nt forget the kraken .

  - I forgot Worilds was a FA ... Justin Houston is as well .

  - four of in a deck . paint colored masks on each one .
- - Couple those perks with armor that increases handcannon reload speed and I d imagine it s nearly instant .

  - America and a billion other places in the world .
- - do you put a primer on your oily eyelids before you put on the liner and if so what primer

  - Howard Stern is not a troll or a psychopath . Every human being in the world is trying to make money anyway they can .
- - Agree . A coup would be Schneiderlin  Hummels and Sissoko . But I doubt anything that great will happen .
  - That would be the best january transfer window ever ...

- - And to think  it was the Cowboys defense that won it this time .
  - And rod marinelli has been responsible for two Lions seasons going down the drain ...
- - Hard to reconcile this with the historically low hurricane activity for the last decade ...
  - There is a theory at least five years old that global warming has increased upper atmosphere wind shear which reduced the likelyhood of hurricanes .
  - There was also a theory that the warming would heat up the oceans creating stronger and more frequent hurricanes .
  - The atmospheric system is too complex for anyone to know make such specific predictions . Massive changes caused by much higher long term temperatures is about all we can say .

  - Is it bad to let it warm up with choke on for to long  Thanks

  - For sure  I m willing to try anyone  especially when they save me money .
- - What parents sends their kids off to hike in the Rocky mountains in Flip flops ... smells fishy .
  - I d guess the parents were uneducated in outdoor recreation . Perhaps they were city folk looking to experience nature and did nt know how important proper footwear is while hiking 
- - Strange the launcher says I got access to tribble tho
  - Same but it s not there when you log on
- - The squib lives there because Harry does - Dumbledore had her move near Harry to keep an eye on him .
  - I thought she had always lived there  and that s why Dumbledore used her to keep track of Harry .

- - Did you think this through before you asked 
  - There have been braille monitors for decades . Even before speech synth .
- - Also one of the few in this thread where the Oracle text is nt much better .
  - It s just terrible all the way down .
- - it says what it gives you when you hover over it
  - Apparently some of them do nt state what you will get . It goes away after the first time you complete it but you still get the pack after completing it .
- - Tell her no more going down on her if she wo nt go down on you either .
  - Ah  the beginnings of a dead bedroom .
- - YES  I ve always thought this 
  - Was in that Red Letter Media video too .
- - For whatever reason  they use it as a weapon and pour it on people or throw it all over everything
  - WTF  Who would use bleach as a weapon  That is not fun  it is extreamly dangerous  and a HUGE dick move .
- - Am I the only one calling the number on the screen 
  - The website does nt work . I m starting to think this was a joke . Do nt joke about serious things  people 
- - Even if He were  I do nt think he d be that upset . It would be blasphemous of you NOT to show off one of His finer works ...

- - No . It bothers me when months go by without even one person looking at my profile .
  - Have you tried getting a better main profile pic

  - From the looks of it  yes . They re still romping about  spreading hate on the site they hate the very most .
- - What the fuck is she wearing  a condom 
  - It s fashion . Look it up .
- - What greater revenge of society against those who seek to take it down than to turn it s greatest enemies into supporters 
  - Does nt work like that . Such levels of psychopathic fanaticism is beyond repair .

- - Thanks very much for the description  Looking forward to getting a bottle .
  - Happy to help  Hope you like it .
- - For the price  as much as I d love to look at one in my bathroom  I d rarely use the tub so I have to agree .

- - But now any team can use those same designs . To recreate it . almost like taking a test  then waiting for everyone to finish  then double checking his answers
  - Most teams are locked by the engine freeze rules . Honda has no such restrictions .
- - Oh yeah ... He is pretty sexy .
  - He s no Garrus  but yeah .
  - I love Garrus  he is awkwardly charming . And he is also pretty sexy . I usually like my turians dark and marked  but he is still hot .
  - Garrus is pretty great . You sound like you might be more partial to Krogan . Personally I prefer Quarians .
- - Created an account just to say this . this team simply does not play enough . Frustrating .
  - Just because they are nt streaming  does nt mean they are nt playing
- - The anti-SEC circle jerk is just as unbearable as the SEC circle jerk .

  - i like this method . how am i doing if i can play my flute whilst running .

- - you re not good  you re not bad  you re just nice . Wicked  It s so good  Also Chicago .
  - I also chose Wicked . Good pick  . D
