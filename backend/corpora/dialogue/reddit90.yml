  - I think it s a good idea  but we should make a new sub for it .

- - Err  he could nt have signed with Chelsea . They got rid of him - that s how it all started .
  - You get the point he s trying to make .
- - Seriously  You do nt mind two people going at it in a public restroom at your local McDonalds while you take your kid in to wash his hands 
  - I think the hardest part in all of that is convincing my fiancee to have sex in a McDonald s bathroom stall .
- - Were those crates of mortars that he was taking cover by 
  - Their empty ammo crates for the artillery rounds which have already been fired
- - If you work in an abortion clinic they might . Probably best to avoid those places if you can .

  - So  At least you did nt fake it . They are truly two-faced .
