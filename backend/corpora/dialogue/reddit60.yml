  - Thank you . The pictures do nt even do it much justice . It turned out a lot better than I expected .
- - Is it that important for it to light up  Is it really 
  - No  But would I rather have it lit up  Yes . Just a question .

  - That s what I m doing . Just gon na move on from it . Life is what it is .
- - Thanks so much  I ve been looking at boar hair brushes to buy  then found these at my grandparents  house  Hopefully this works out 
  - Use a silver polish instead to polish the silver . Baking soda and toothpaste and frequently suggested  but they re actually far too abrasive on the metal .
- - I think the protagonist should use some kind of ranged weapon . Something about characters with glasses makes me think that .
  - I was thinking the same thing  he just has that vibe of being a secret badass when it comes to using guns
- - Sounds like a compulsive liar to me .
  - Sounds like a personality disorder to me .
- - I m doing fine . Just bored tonight with nothing to do . You 
  - yeah im bored too  i would love to talk to my bf  and spend some time with him but hes not here yet  so im pretty lonely .
- - Wow  You actually tried to defend or mask this behavior . Shift the blame a little  and everything is okay .
  - How am I defending the murder of innocent people  All I said was that it s easy to exploit because people let their fear and bigotry control them .
- - I can see from your post history that you do nt like ESO .
  - Not who you replied to  but does that really matter  You make the initial claim  so the burden of proof is on you .
- - Portals placed on a surface that moves dissipate when that surface actually moves .
  - There is one instance in the second game where that is nt true .
- - I wish you had a timelapse of you making these  because they re awesome and I want to learn more about the creation of this type of art .

  - Exactly . I think that these people would have absolutely loved it .
- - What s your favorite item on the menu  I m sure you re tired of the food but there s got ta be something
  - Seeing as McDonald s menus differ from area to area  in my area  the Mediterranean wrap is very good
- - I actually have the scarlet coven isis skin  and she is a tonne of fun . and its not like im not used to a god without any escapes . D

- - So it turns out the big version causes server crashes after about two minutes . Learning new things every day .
  - lol  is it possible to make that into an energized node 
  - Yep . Put in a taint biome and it turns into a tainted node  losing the hungry modifier . Then just energize normally .
  - But I could still energize it even with it having the hungry node modifier correct  just anyone who approaches it will die 
- - This a adult male not a family . He has no excuse . He abandoned his family
  - SHE left him  not the other way around .
- - I just had a gut feeling on it so I did it
  - I think Burkman will take it also .
- - Actually  at this point in the offseason  a broken arm should heal quite nicely  should even be ready for the camps in May .
  - At least he didnt die of dysentery .
- - Thanks  looks like I m out of luck then
  - You can buy a Stan s kit and run them tubeless just fine .
- - Seriously  man . That s amazing . Amazing enough that I m looking around for good prices on the camera
  - Its a great camera . You ll enjoy it that s for sure .
- - Yes  thank you for correcting yourself .
  - When i m wrong i do nt hesitate to admit it .
- - Forgive me sire  for I know not who King Kirk is . So who is he 
  - Eh  I already told you all that I know . P
- - I got an email today that the one I ordered is nt actually in stock . I m sad .
  - I m actually looking to sell the same one if you re interested .
- - It s not actually under Wax Pass . That was a side project I was working on . Regardless  thumbs up 
  - Sorry to get that wrong . I ll correct it in the comment .
- - Do those gigantic trees come from a mod or did you build them  Beautiful build

- - Oh . Yah . Geography class . I forgot about that . My apologies . Anyways  sounds shitty . And cold . I think you should move .
  - Nah man the cold s the best part
- - Damnit  I misread that link as being from cbs and thought you were sending me to a real news source instead of a for-profit cult .
  - So in that case you assume there are such places in France 
- - Because it is so hard to look at the comment above mine to understand the context .
  - But what if he edits it  you ll look like a fool man 
- - Brilliant officiating not to raise the flag on Costa . Hate Chelsea but it was the correct decision . Was completely irrelevant to the initial shot .
  - i dont agree . Lloris sprawled in front of Costa in case he got a foot on it . I see that as interference . Lloris has reacted to the offside player
- - I fail to see what this has to do with us .
  - you must not have read the story gj
- - CHERRY MX Blues  they have the click .
  - For gaming  and for a person moving from rubber dome 
- - Vlad mains  I m probably the only one  and I m pretty nice .
  - Vlad mains are quiet . I think the stack counting keeps them busy .
- - The question  is the reduced harm from the outlawed thing worth the increased harm from a black market funded increase in organized crime 
  - If you re earnestly interested in this subject I suggest you read the majority opinion of McDonald v. City of Chicago Cause I m too drunk to write it here
- - This is the weirdest logic ever . It s bizarre .
  - That s because you re indoctrinated to never question the book .

  - I do nt know  to me is just sounds like his balls just soaked it all up .
- - Who gives a shit  I bet they are having a freaking ball of a time  otherwise they would nt be playing ... Kill and let kill 
  - Exactly . Some people are successful in life and choose to blow money on Internet spaceships . As long as the person flying the ship is having fun  who cares 
- - Someone needs to contact the news she will be gone within a week .
  - Ive thought about it . Theres so much I could out this company on . The list is honestly endless 
- - Someone please fucking tell me why this is not the scariest shit imaginable .
  - This happens on a regular basis . This is nt even that big compared to what we ve seen in the past .
- - arent you not suposed to say the brands and what not
  - Nah the thing with this battle is I was trying to get the focus towards the overall look of the fit rather than the brands .
- - No  provided you do nt have any Touch ID events set .
  - Well before the update  I had the activator double tap action set to activate reachability  but now I ca nt seem to find it .
- - If you like Shows like Breaking Bad  one of my favorites is Shameless . Its so bad at times I cringe .

  - It s actually completely fixed itself since some of the lovely ladies on here advised me to work my kegels . It helped tremendously .
- - I ve always wanted to hear an orchestral interpretation of the movie Return to Oz . The subject matter lends itself to something like that .
  - I m not familiar with the movie  is it a sequel to the original movie 
- - Have you tried out The Resistance Expansion yet  So curious to hear what you think 
  - Nope  most of my friends started disappearing home for Christmas shortly after I gave it and we did nt end up playing any Resistance this week .
- - Driving costs more money and makes you fat . Riding costs next to nothing and burns fat .

  - Agreed . Seems like it does nt hold much water .
- - try throwing a punch in mid air .
  - Tell that to half of the smash roster who punch just fine in midair .
- - So having a horizontal line under the breast is normal . Thankyou  I was concerned with this a bit ago .
  - That s a stretch mark is nt it  There s products out there to help with that .
- - Anna Kendrick woud have to get incredibly fit to pull it off .
  - Agreed  though I do nt doubt her acting capabilities at all . It s just the fitness aspect she d have to worry about .

  - Yeah that makes the most sense . Thanks stranger
- - Why Alabama and Tennessee instead of Alabama and Auburn 
  - I tried to have each team have a different rival .
- - Dare you to ask him if he needs a spot .
  - Or ask if he needs help with his back .
- - My prediction is that this will not pass because you would essentially be teaching black kids how to use guns and their second amendment rights .
  - Whoa  that s a bit racist there .
  - It seems that many conservatives are very gung-ho for gun rights  until those guns are in the hands of black people .
  - I agree that some are  however if you look at the NRA and most other gun rights organization you ll find that s not true at all .
- - Well  I think any pre-season NHL game would be at Cedar Park Center since the owner of the Dallas Stars and Texas Stars now runs it .
  - negative  if you win the award you are guaranteed a game .
- - Actually declining cause tribunal doesnt work so ppl are changing thier games thats kinda sad
  - because of tribunal  best reason i ve heard yet .
- - Good to know . But my character is nt defined by the shittiness of others .
  - That s all well and good  but a life long Ducks fan s character should definitely be partially defined by a hatred of washington .
- - Like a lot of people have already mentioned that designs that are more beastly would definitely be more welcome than more shapely gods
  - More gods like release tyr is what I want

  - I deserve that . I m a lazy writer . . P
- - or it s just made to be funny and cute 
  - No  I do nt think he purposely messed up the title . Look at his comment history  it s just his grasp of the English language .
- - maybe this is being too noob  but can anybody explain why these challenging strategies are usually called man mode 
  - Because they re all warriors which is supposed to be a manly job  even though most of the people I ve seen playing warrior are female characters .
- - what are you wrapping your sandwiches in 
  - Oh I have nt started . I was just looking for tips to start doing it
- - Had bad experiences in an LDR before mate .

  - Just tested it and you still have muzzle flash
  - Oh well . Thanks for testing it out though 
- - I hope the best for OP as well . Why would she be helping she just had surgery done she is in pain
  - Because most women are too stubborn and controlling to let someone else do all the work . Source . I am a woman .
- - So you re saying Clarissa was a witch and her family sent her to live with her aunts
  - more so that Sabrina also became a Journalist who had an angry mean boss and a bunch of dorky coworkers .
- - Awww yes . The fatal flaw of both our qb s

  - It was supposed to get you hooked  that tutorial was also the sneak peak demo back in the day . God I was salivating after that mission .
- - Apparently you can get away with murder in the secondary tonight .
  - Someone should have told Aaron Hernandez to do his thing tonight ...
- - But do nt you ever get bored where you do nt feel like doing anything and just be bored  I have that quite often .
  - Yeah  those are called Sundays . I enjoy that feeling a lot  and usually I just wind up cooking something over the top and chatting with my girlfriend .

- - I am hoping we do nt have school
  - Me too but I kinda want school so I ca nt get this plan over with and I do nt have to feel anxious about it .
- - Only for like half the year  but I think they used CBS announcers the whole time .
  - I think Nfl network wanted out of the game broadcast production and CBS saw fit to take up extra games .
- - The problem is that they have to figure this out as they re fighting . Neither has knowledge of the other .
  - Does Doomsday grow in power each time he comes back from being blown apart like Cell does 
- - plz buff him i cant do shit to enemies now in conquest with that shit for shit nerf in solo lane
  - I agree other guardians can scale way better than hades  he needs his creep cleaning abilities back .

- - a horrendous period  I do nt know  it certainly looked a lot better than the winnipeg game
  - he just talking about the Phil i think
- - Yeah the shift click is something I use every time I remember  and forget almost immediately afterwards . Also that revolt date would be helpful  thanks for the tip .

- - Now  someone make up a paint scheme for the roman Air Force .
  - I got the motto  anyway . Veni  non vidi  vici . Because it s missiles and Beyond Visual Range . Get it

  - I think most teams in the NBA are done with him altogether .
- - Are Lowry s numbers gon na take a big hit  Should I be looking to trade Lowry or hold him 
  - They wil revert back to his numbers when derozan was playing . It s not like he is an unknown on this team .
- - Make sure to check the local dog pound
  - Thank you  Heading there first thing in the morning 
- - I thought he already mentioned in an interview like a month ago that they were doing a collab 
  - link plz anyone I did nt know this
- - someone has never ulted late in a teamfight to understand how much damage his passive actually does .
  - i know how much dmg it does  it just fucks up your mobility boots and the farm
- - Yeah that s true  if food s not on the table you have to figure something out .
  - It bums me out I live in a super conservative area . Legalization even for medical purposes is a far off dream .
- - Did the PAK sora come out in America already  Or is that a japanese import 
  - I think its in the states . I got it a KH showcase in LA .
- - What cretin removed this  Edit . this was previously deleted
  - One of the mods thought it was a fake account so deleted it .
- - Try verifying the integrity of the game cache through Steam .
  - I ve done that as well  nothing came up . I also uninstalled and reinstalled it but it did nt help .
- - Fuck . This shows why I m not making the big bucks .
  - Keep at it  you will make the big bucks .
- - What new report system are you talking about  The one they implemented like a year ago  or have they slipped something past us without us knowing 
  - People receive more reports based on the number of games they play  where as before it was time based .
- - You re the bastard that was selling those gorgeous bichirs I wanted  I mean HI  Glad they went to a good home
  - Ha yep . Dropped them off yesterday . They were awesome bichirs . Miss them already .
- - Thats a bot . I do nt really suggest removing the post just yet .
  - Yeah  the answer was mostly for moderators
- - And they shut us out twice in a row .
  - look where we re at now . LOOK AT IT
- - No one wanted Reigns to win . People wanted Batista to lose .
  - I was here in the threads . People said they were marking out thinking Roman would win  but whatever I m not gon na argue about it .
- - My cat thinks she is a human and will only drink out of glass because thats what we use . She has her own glass on the coffee table ... super spoiled
  - Aw  my toy poodle was the same  And she would nt eat out of her bowl because her name tag would hit it and the sound would bother her .
- - Look it up  it is nt hard to find
  - Oh I had nt thought of that .
- - As much as this idea sounds alright  I have to say that introducing new currencies into the game is a bad thing
  - It isnt really a new currency  its just gems that you can only use for buy stuff for yourself
- - last remnants of the champions league though lennon bale was one of the deadliest combos of pace i ve ever seen at tottenham
  - Well  we still have BAE  LOL .
- - OP  this has to do with the equipment glitch that the save editor has or you just did it all in game 
  - i stumbled upon it in game while equipping gear on my character . did nothing unusual otherwise .
- - Because people want to win at the alpha stage proof of concept software test environment by blowing up as many ships as possible .
  - I suppose that s one way of testing the game .
- - That Whip art is not good looking at all .
  - Right  It s kind of a weird angle to put the thing at  and very close-up on the skull of the handle .
- - Sometimes my phone says it s not inserted and I have to restart  is that what it is or is it something else 
  - No  it s just a new phone and I have nt set it up correctly .
- - I am planning to buy the phone  do you have anymore invites to spare 
  - I think mine are all expired  sorry
- - Dammit  pure trash . Not a very good week .
  - Yeah  got some nice upgrades that I needed though .
- - I think it s been well established that the attack was in retaliation towards Sony for releasing a movie about killing their dear leader .
  - But it accomplishes nothing . Any fool could tell you it would just make people want to see the movie more .
- - chelsea hijacked the salah deal just to sit him on their bench
  - He was stupid enough to go there . His own choice . Hope he enjoys it .
- - Muscala with the goggles as soon as Korver starts to shoot is the best part of this by far
  - That wide stance he gets in before setting up his goggles
- - What s the job market like in Maryland 
  - In the area around Baltimore the job market is amazing for anything medical . there is a tiny tech industry  but not much .
- - I would suggest buying one  then going into a biker bar . If you do nt get beat up you ll get laughed at .
  - You d probably be ask nicely to leave . Stop watching so much television .
- - No one in real life gives a fuck what college you went to .
  - It really depends on what you want to do and where you work for . Doctor or big law firm . Ivy league schools are usually looked at .
- - I know this girl  she used to date one of my friends . Hard to talk to since her only two interests are coffee and herself .
  - i too know this girl . she used to date one of my friends . hard to talk to since she always had cocks in her mouth .
- - So because you did nt know something right away  you automatically disliked it 
  - lol Ask him . But people automatically hated it because what they thought about the updated features without playing the game
- - I hate Flickr . It makes it very difficult to view on mobile .
  - Agreed . Flickr is terrible for mobile viewing
- - The Problem is they rush it out after Star Wars and no one seem to have read the script ... they just made it .
  - At least they did . Beneficial in the long run .
- - OP just for future reference those terms are outdated . We re just camera operators .
  - Til camera operators is the correct term for addressing people of your trade .
- - This is a definition of respect that I can definitely appreciate . Too bad you are nt challenging my view  or I d give you a delta 
  - Haha  well  thanks  I was just trying to make a point if you define things clearly that removes great deal of confusion around them .
- - First time I seen someone refer to migi as a female
  - Derp ; not intentional  Migi s VA is female so it threw me . Will edit accordingly  thanks 
- - actually this is way closer to reality than some of the other terrible images i ve seen on here
  - I agree . I was in a bad mood when I posted that .
- - It s a glitch actually . Enjoy it when it happens lol
  - Is it  I saw some dev art that was what I saw . I hope it was nt  It was cool 
- - Wonderful  I am looking forward to those pictures 
  - I just finished the album on imgur and will post first thing in the morning 
- - Lol absolutely not happening . Are they even trying anymore  At least the Bony rumour sounded credible .
  - the only thing that makes me thing the bony deal wo nt happen is the AFCON thing
- - Lampard was not offered a contract  and Lampard was nt a one club man .
  - I do understand that but maybe its time for Gerrard to try something new .
- - Prove it  You admitted to it 
  - You keep repeating that lie . It does nt make any more true when you repeat lies . I guess proof is too much to ask of you .
- - Their kinsman was ambitious  so naturally they all died 
  - The shiny ambition of Eric gave them a series of strokes and really really bad luck
- - That third shot is the tits . Hope that was your main goal  it s definitely the most interesting ... the framing and empty space pairs with your aesthetic perfectly
  - I had not changed the original staged elements  so the profile shot came out unexpected . Thanks for the feedback 
- - I have no evidence for this  but I like to think that they are just a mythological creature  like dragons are in our world .
  - I was starting to think that  would be pretty cool if that s the case
- - Would it be possible for you to take some flats 
  - Absolute beginner question ; what is a flat 
- - Replays are not video files  they re just button inputs that the game plays back .
  - you could send them to someone who has a capture card and willing to record it for you ...
- - Well based on your article  nature will eventually do the job for you anyways . I had never heard of plucking a dog until today . Seriously  TIL .
  - Sure  nature will do the job ... hence fur on the floors all the time LOL .
- - MKG was injured for a while as well  but yeah  he does seem to play with more drive than anyone else .
  - I see him taking it to the rim with confidence and purpose and he s been very aggressive on the boards lately
- - I hope that Titanic II replicates this exactly  it s beautiful  The detail is immaculate .
  - If that ship ever actually gets built  then when I die I m coming back as an iceberg just so I can sink it .
  - It would probably be easier if you came back as an attack submarine .
  - If you re going to go to that kind of effort why not just come back as the Titanic 
- - You sure it is nt because of your in-game video settings 
  - pretty sure  because I keep changing the colors and brightness on Nvidia panel nothing s happening ingame so I guess the problem comes from there .
- - she deleted her instagram sometime after they broke up
  - Thanks  you were one quick to answer .
- - I would have learned to take my car to a shop before I start fucking around with the brakes 
  - Youtube my friend . Do you do the same for an oil change 
- - i prefer the guy that bought currency from the mint with a credit card  then took it to the bank and paid off the credit card immediately .
  - A lot of people did that . Was with the new golden dollars . They charged no shipping on the coins so they had no loss when they bought them .
- - I would be afraid to face that thing . It looks very fast .
  - Hehe  that s what I was going for . Makes no sense in-universe though since I got rid of the GN drives  but whatever
- - Interesting that they felt the need to bring up the fact that him and Mike Ashley had nt met before he started at NUFC  like get over it guys .
  - Well said  bizarre thing to mention  paranoid nutters .
- - you told me only you were allowed to climb mountains .
  - My advice is not canon  just like Michael .
- - A good response would be for everyone to share the picture Charlie Hebdo tweeted that instigated this attack ... The Barbara Streisand effect at its most necessary
  - Which picture is that  I ll def share
- - Elizabeth Warren is a rich bitch . Just a wealthy  whiny hypocrite .
  - So you can only advocate for the poor if you are poor  That does nt even come close to making sense bud .
- - No  it s true . People who never smoked can keep their mouth shut but someone quits and all they can do is bitch and moan .
  - It s also a fact that it bothers smokers so much because they do nt have the strength to quit .
  - Is it  I m not a smoker  champ . Just an observant man . Ex smokers are like the gluten free people from that South Park episode .
  - Okay  I d rather sound whiny than as smug and douchey as you  buddy .
- - Gon na be rocking the Mirage  hopefully there will be another shuttle stop there again .
  - Last year the shuttle from the Mirage was absolutely flawless .

- - I ve been for the past four years  but have nt really seen it once - too wastey face . Maybe this year will be the year though 
  - who are you to break with tradition  
- - Finally a brit doing us proud . You are absolutely divine  I wish we had beauties like you in the south west 
  - I might be closer than you think ...
- - it s mostly because people are bored as shit ... so then they talk and freak out about weather . i have no other explanation .
  - Fair enough and it s better than anything i can come up with as well . Nothing like a little hysteria to make a small problem seem bigger than it is
- - According to google  another player had a similar issue and upon relogging the lead popped onto the ground
  - Thanks I ll give it a try .
- - brb  going to use this to cite a Wikipedia page .

- - I believe it s the left that are the only ones still using this term . So yes  please put it to bed ...
  - Im sure theyd be happy to if the repubs would stop trying to implement it .

- - Is January just the time of year Lamela gets his annual injury 
  - He does nt want to be transferred  Lol or just bad luck .

- - Time for people to adapt to the market . Sorry .
  - Sounds fantastic . So how will they afford anything 
- - This has nothing to do with this sub .
  - You know how often people mistype and end up here .
- - Except Nintendo titles ... I can see them going under before letting LoZ go multiplatform .
  - True  oh well  eventually their copyright will lapse and then emulators will reign supreme 
- - That is what the reports have been  yes you can see the bullet hit the cement in the video

- - Inconsistent points . I d definitely rather have Aguero over him  and there are cheaper strikers who get the job done .
  - You were comparing him to RvP and Falcao  not Aguero . For his cost and point return  he s a better option than RvP and Falcao .
  - oh sorry  I was talking about in general  not just RvP and Falcao . I do nt want any United strikers tbh  there s too many .

  - SAME I was like what is going on
- - I m not saying weeds is any better  but at least he does nt do fucking afk streams .
  - True . Weeds is a double edged blade for the community .

- - Sorry about my error . I m not very good when it comes to programming . However  I now understand this equation . Thanks Again

- - Nice  What have you noticed that s significantly different in your life because of the weight loss 
  - Really aside from the obvious issues with energy  the biggest improvement is clothes shopping .
- - Honestly a whole medium pizza is nt a huge feat . Not saying its great for you but ...
  - Every pizza is a personal pizza if you try hard and believe in yourself .

  - Everything has already been made somewhere in the universe . Everything is just a repost at this point .
- - Nice review and nice find . Love Four Roses barrel proof selections I have had . Never seen one of these hit in my state though 
  - They come around  I was lucky enough to be able to score one . Binny s gets everything .
  - They sure do  you see they have the re-released Bourye 
  - I heard that  have nt seen any yet though . I did enjoy Son of Bourye pretty well  maybe it s time for me to start looking ...
- - There is barely a difference . I do nt get it .
  - I think OP is trying to make the point that the page on the left includes a bunch of unnecessary titles and rambling text .
  - Maybe it s the engineer in me but I found the one on the left much easier to skim ...
  - I really thought the left one was the fixed version .
- - Huh  His name is on it .
  - My bad  totally forgot about his time in Pittsburgh . Still though  I feel like winning as a head coach would be a better experience than as an assistant .
- - fun fact  his name means fatherland in his native language which is albanian
  - Also the name for a sports streaming website .
- - When you lose to the sixers you kind of deserve it .
  - I just hope the refs get called out for this one like they should .
- - no good ones though  they are all incredibly buggy and out of place .
  - Well  Bethesda games are always buggy  And the out of place is just a matter of taste I guess .
- - UGA has the most recent visit  so we ll see . Vols need to do another or something and could probably seal the deal with that .
  - I d say it will depend on who Schotty hires to coach the o-line
