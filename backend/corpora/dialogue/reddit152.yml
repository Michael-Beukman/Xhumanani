  - I d be worried about a congregation that prioritizes the size of my cathedral over the content of my sermons .
- - That s sick  I really like your style and use of color .
  - Thanks  the tattoo should eventually be quite a bit better
- - From a friend working in a jewelry store . Woman walks in with a large partial geode of clear quartz crystals and asks how much these diamonds are worth .

  - Sadly no . She was found on the side of the road still all tied up . Someone brought her into the nearest shelter .
- - Was gon na suggest that one  Kirby is simple and very fun  and Triple Deluxe is great .
  - Came here to suggest the same . I have been playing it  and it is pretty easy without being boring and the graphics are cute and fun 
- - I believe everyone here is already aware of that

  - I did not pay extra for the burst rifle . It s a simple as that
  - That s good  neither did I .

  - Only the two exotics and the vision of confluence that walked by itself to the vault on the tower . The purple primaries I had are still gone
- - Between this and xkcd  I m pretty sure I can hold entire conversations without ever saying a word .
  - Throw in Questionable Content to cover any sort of social drama you might encounter .
- - A recap of every huge rumor that turned out to be fake .
  - Ai nt no body got time for that .
- - So what do you think  does friendly to allied take the same amount of work as from neutral to friendly 
  - I have a feeling friendly to allied takes longer  at least the grind felt like it
- - If I do nt workout nearly every day I feel incomplete . Lifting and running are such fabulous hobbies .
  - Me too  I feel guilty and lazy
- - What a lad having continued playing  Wait till he gains some more experience  he ll be amazing 
  - Very true  Imagine having you head stapled and then playing on knowing you will have to head the ball . O

  - heh thanks dude  yeah it was understandably confusing lol .
- - I m hoping for heads no matter what .
  - Well then it serves its purpose . You would subconsciously assign your preferred outcome to heads . No need to even flip the coin .
- - I think your premise is flawed  especially if you have reached that conclusion based on your personal experience with only one woman .
  - Of course its flawed . That s obvious .
- - She attended Xavier school for gifted kids  and probably teaches literature now
  - It is possible to double post you know guys
- - Wow this is great  Your other art is amazing as well  thanks for sharing here . D

  - Fair . I cycle and it is a ball ache with all the cars blocking other routes ... If it means more out of the car then all good .
- - I get what you mean . It being a single shot would be more impressive if it was a live action movie . Not hating on animation
  - Of course  if they did this exact shot in a live action movie  the majority of what you re seeing on screen would have to be CGI anyway .
- - I m a teacher and have never been drug tested .
  - Teacher too . We re the responsible members of society .
- - Qdoba now has free Guacamole . Fuck Chipotle .
  - Guac is free at Chipotle in veg burritos .
  - Are you comparing rape to skipping meat 
  - You re right  I guess forcing someone to eat a meat burrito would be more accurate .

  - I could make one to fit him .

  - It s all part of Davis  plan . He s going to the Chiefs to destroy it from the inside .
- - A locker if it does nt have one .
  - I honestly have no idea if it does or not . What does it do 
- - Are you physically turning the console on and off with the button or are you using a controller  Because it does nt make noises with the controller
  - I figured that out last night  always used the controller before .
- - The Falcons . Always the Falcons . But especially this year after sweeping the Saints for the first time in nearly a decade .
  - Dont worry  we hate you too .

  - Fire Wyrm is actually an Extreme Dungeon .
- - What s that bit about leaving for France  Did anyone else catch that 
  - For a school trip . I forget if it was an interview or a testimony but her French teacher mentioned she would have been going on their trip to France .

  - it s funny how wrong you are .
- - If you bring the coffee here  I can provide both milk and cream 
  - Alas but I ca nt drive  I am trapped within the limits of my transit system .
- - That s pretty close to me . Your comment just impacted my life more than you will ever know it .
  - They need small people in the army . Someone needs to slide down the pipe to fix a weld .
- - You sound unreasonably angry . Maybe you should see a therapist .
  - According to his comment history  he has nipple piercings and is an Ohio State fan  which makes perfect sense .
- - I ca nt stop looking at that guys finger on the right  It s so long  Is it just me 
  - Camera lens distortion . Wide angle lenses distort the outer edges of the frame . Source . I m a photographer .
- - Nope  never before has my libido been so low . No  I do nt think it deserves medical attention yet .
  - At what point do you think it will need medical attention 
  - By the time I ll be refusing sex to my girlfriend ; but that s common sense .
  - Yeah  good plan . Do you work out and eat right  They say that works .
  - I began working out as a new years  resolution . As per diet  I would place it that I only eat what I need to .
  - Well good . Hope it works out for you man . Do nt stress either  happens to everyone .
- - Pretty sure his arms are on their shoulders .
  - You re right . These ladies are laying into his arms and he has draped his arms on their shoulders .
  - They re basically having a threesome right there in the middle of the bar mitzvah 
  - Her elbow is practically inches from his penis  She wants the D 
- - Have you heard Chip lately  Sounds like a pouting boy in the pressers . His arrogance is a huge problem
  - I disagree  I like the arrogance . Much better than the ho-hum complacency of the later Reid years . Only eagles fans see that as a problem
- - Awesome  I figured there has nt been a season without turnover since the merger . Thanks for the info 
  - Sure  luckily I compiled this a few days ago when a user asked which season had the most turnover -- unfortunately the thread was deleted before I could finish .
- - The painting is beautiful  but I almost wish I did nt know the back story because that is so  horribly  awfully sad .
  - Firefighter s found my cat s body and buried it in an unmarked grave in our backyard .
- - Give this man a ukelele . Joking  but what kinda  electric or acoustic  they look a bit different in prefered styling 
  - Ukelele sounds more proportionate to other things  that s not bad  but I was thinking electric in my own head  that being what I mainly play .
- - That guy has done tons and tons of voice-over work for all kinds of stuff we all know and love .
  - Ya like ... Eeyore from Winny the Pooh . Go figure
- - Dude  Cant even recall that we didnt used WASD back then ... we used the freaking arrow keys ... gosh
  - whoa whoa whoa -- let s not generalize .
- - Come on D  one more time boys .
  - Who needs D when you have refs 
- - Is our offense starting to click  Edit . no
  - Sure it is . You know that clicking sound you get in your car when you have a dead battery  That s our offense .
- - Looks pretty solid . Have you filmed heavier sets to find weaknesses 
  - This is actually the heaviest I ve pulled haha . Started SS about a month ago  have nt tried for a one rep max yet .
- - Except for Mitchell and Ayoade who are a great pair who were wasted on this episode .
  - If anything at least they made it watchable
- - I m very curious about this show  but after watching the first episode about the pig thing  I m a little apprehensive ...
  - Yeah  that was a weird one . The second one was good ... still working on building up the energy to watch it . In the meantime  Enterprise Marathon 
- - I think it might have been deleted . I had it saved  but I ca nt find it anymore .
  - So did she do it  Sorry to sound cruel but curiosity and that .
- - This is friggin great  I wonder how Tyl will succeed where Hek failed .
  - Because Tyl Regor it s just a super model compared to Hek  handsome matters .
- - I dread what Bonnie is going to look like .
  - I hate to find out what that chicken from hell Chica is gon na look .
- - I hope Elijah gets playing time and shows his inner Trillsap .
  - Wow  did nt know Elijah s playing for the Jazz now .
- - He s playing like an All-Star on a per minute basis .
  - What s most exciting is that those numbers do nt really go down on the rare occasions that he gets starter minutes due to injury .
- - I do nt know about elsewhere but I have found that up here in Canada that government building like libraries are the cleanest and safest .
  - Probably here in the US  too . Books  Ai nt nobody got time for that .
- - It s like you do nt even care about his feelings  rambo . Our rights end where his feelings begin .
  - I do nt care about lefties feelings . They might as well be dirt on the road . Does nt move me either way .

  - My dress zipped up but had fake buttons along the zip .
- - You did nt teach Embiid how to Twitter  you showed him a couple notes on the instrument he was born to play .
  - Agreed . A prodigy finds his own way .
- - Wow  I guess if you re looking for it you see it  but no  you re dumb .
  - I m not dumb by any means . I bought a case of it cheap since it was discontinued and noticed it as soon as I opened the package .
  - Alright  dumb might have been harsh  but really  the SS logo is very distinct .
  - Obviously . I thought this resembled it though . Guess not .
- - If you rear-end a vehicle in front of you  YOU are at fault  no matter what speed either of you are going .

- - What an odd thing for you to take a stand on . Weird .
  - Not really . I just noticed he copy and pasted that comment and thought it was worth mentioning .
- - A new pair of glasses can make all the difference

- - Comcast already stated the service would be blocked on their systems .
  - Do you have a link to that story 
- - I really love it  You should totally tweet it to him if you have nt already
  - i sent the tweet ... I just hope he saw it 
- - Nah  it s not just for Hell in a Cell . It just randomly happens sometimes . You can get others like tornado tag  handicap  tag ladder ect .
  - Huh thats cool but stupid that they are nt just in the game then .
- - Yeah  because her degree was in bullshit . Universities have degrees where they want people to pay money to not learn a thing .
  - Really  Are you really trying to make that a valid argument 
  - It IS a valid argument . The only thing you can be with her degree is a scam artist on the internet .
  - And the only person you re going to convince with your logic is a conspiracy theorist .
- - Terry not being in that final was such a let down .
  - I knowww  at least he won a car though
- - I m near Dulwich Hill station  no problem here
  - I m right on the river  no issue .
- - They re not OP . A lot of people just do nt study them  which is their own folly .
  - Thats what I mean by OP  Honestly it feels like a cheat code in a video game  thats why I used the term OP .
- - If that is nt a zero fucks given statement  I do nt know what is .

  - The order of the names goes from the most recent name suggestions to the names that were suggested first .
  - I used to do it names that were suggested first  but I felt like I would accidentally skip over names easier that way .
  - It might be nice to just run the list through a randomizer . It s not a big deal either way though .
- - Good luck finding something good and new 
  - Thanks  Meg  How are things going with you 
- - And PA s race to the bottom continues ...
