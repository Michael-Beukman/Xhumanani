- - I can definitely understand where you re coming from . Idk I m really into that album  but I could understand if people are nt a fan of it .
  - Yeah it s cool you know enjoy what you want
- - Both are an issue . We must handle this correctly .
  - Indeed  which side of the issue are you on 
- - How is that  I ve always wanted to buy one of those .
  - I really like that it makes my truck shift much harder and the extra gauges it has are an awesome feature . It also makes my thirty pull even more ridiculous

  - I m hoping I can at least get it finished by the end of this year .
- - Am I the only person annoyed this story does not explain why if it was someones house they had signs indicating it was a thrift store 
  - I was so embarrassed I just left lmao

  - Haha  perhaps I was a little harsh . It just irritated me that much .
- - Lou s City Bar in Columbia Heights is a Badgers bar  not sure if they love the Pack as much  but it s likely 
  - The real Badger bar is Hamiltons  Lou s is pretty much spill over
- - What  Are you wiping your ass with empty toilet paper rolls . Gross 
  - Paper towels . Not very comfortable  but effective .
- - Walking would be harder . Writing would be harder . But picking up a pen I drop off the floor would become facile
  - not if we were born that way .
- - What you re spewing is hate . They are simply choosing not to participate . Was Gandhi spewing hate  It s passive resistance ...
  - I m not spewing hate at all . I ca nt believe you even think that . You re obviously trolling .
- - No Love for The Guest  Best soundtrack since Scott Pilgrim  in my book
  - It was really good . Only soundtrack I ve downloaded all year .

  - A nub . In this instance  the opposite of an elephant is a nub .
- - I liked Rock n rolla a lot  I might have even bought the DVD . I do nt think I ve met another person who liked it though .
  - Fuckin loved it but so sad the trilogy ai nt did not gon happen
- - Except that  no matter you intentions  burning a Canadian flag has one symbolic meaning only  which is the condemnation of Canada as a whole .

- - Because I did nt tuck in my shirt . Hardcore about the dress code .
  - I had to wear a tie everyday I feel you .
- - Losing the attachments is why I ll never prestige .

  - ok ill get on then and sory i have missed you if i did
- - damn we played like shit the last few min ... great defense by the hawks ... guess thats it
  - terrible bench . I stand my assessment that doc is a horrible GM .
- - theyll step on it before knowing its there . We have oracles lens for this . Sounds like somebody got owned by teemo .
  - I just came up with this idea . I do nt mind Teemo players . I was just wondering if this would be an interesting game mechanic to be implemented .
- - Wait a minute  why was he pulled over   This is harassment 
  - He was black . Cop was Murican . Duh 
- - Women become mentally broken when they get fucked by anyone besides the father of their children .
  - Well that explains why your mother was acting weird when I was balls deep in that anus .
- - Am I stupid for wanting to avoid Steph Curry and his high price tag 
  - No  not at all . Just depends how you are redistributing that money .
- - I was going to ask about GroupMe haha . What is it and what do I do to get one of those 
  - It s an app that s basically a giant chat room where we plan games friendly trash talk etc
  - Ok . It s the same email as I gave you - just signed on via Facebook . Or is that not recommended 
  - It s up to you . The app is easier to just have on your phone .
- - Why stop there  Why not declare war on all religions while you are at it 
  - Because not all religions are equally toxic to the wellbeing of society .
- - Holy shit what a difference . Thanks . I did nt notice how little comprehension I had of the data until I looked at this .
  - I agree totally . The problem is if OP had posted that someone would say it does nt look beautiful enough .
- - David Blatt will not be coaching Cleveland next season . He is the Moyes of the NBA .
  - We ll see what GM James has to say about that .
- - Yeah but they do nt the same amount of financial aid . They have way bigger endowments and could afford to give an international student a full ride .
  - Indeed - but again  schools are far less likely to hand out financial aid to international students .
- - Is mio good  The cell mass flavor I have tastes like shit alone and whatever delicious drink I put it into all of a sudden also tastes like shit
  - Mio is good  I use crystal light flavoring myself though . Really anything will be fine as long as it masks the taste of the fiber
- - Also  my newest principle . testosterone is neat .
  - How s it been working out for you

  - Not as good as desktop but im on wifi  and my router is really far away so its not a fair comparison .
- - Well  yeah oddly  that s not exactly normal . I feel bad for him though . I wonder how he got burned ; That must ve been hell .
  - Those are nt burns  it s a rare skin condition called Vitiligo .
- - I hear an iron and towel do wonders top reset the glue in bindings .

  - Apparently I do nt have Zebstrika  Lanturn  and Swanna either Yeah  I am
  - Just to make sure  do you care about your ID on the Spiritomb  Or is it ok if it changes 
  - I do nt care . Feel free to change it
- - I m jealous  Where are you  I want to move to there 
  - Haha  I m in Melbourne  Australia . I m currently melting into a puddle . And our cats are all hiding . Heat is horrible 
  - Blasphemy  Heat is wonderful  Especially dry heat .
  - Haha  I prefer winter . I m as white as a snowman . Hence the melting .
- - Ottawa has to some how get McDavid now . Him and Lazar are just to good together .
  - Yep  time to tank  Sens  They re not making the playoffs  anyway  might as well .

  - Ok  so do nt ask the question if you re not interested in reading any answers 
- - It s Norway  they should be doing Viking funerals because it gets rid of the body and it looks badass 
  - Getting permission for that is a TON of work  too much bureaucracy .
- - How did you get it  Is it authentic 
  - Probably not . Or maybe he saw the guys sign it . Who knows 
- - go for it  life s short and full of suprises .
  - Might be shorter if he smokes that weed
- - If you want to watch this on netflix in the US  you can actually use the Hola Better Internet plugin and trick netflix into thinking you re in another country .
  - Which country do you need to switch to  Thanks for the heads up 
  - np OP says it s on netflix in Argentina  Brazil  Columbia  Mexico . I have nt verified  but that might be a place to start .
  - Thanks  Can confirm Argentina does work .

  - I guess Swedes are just hung like that 
- - Maybe I m a terrible person  but that was very entertaining to me .
  - He spoke a lot of truth . Even though the OP wishes we were all formless blobs of polite jelly .
- - I know that . I was curios if that information could be implemented into the game . I m sure it s possible . Just like steam .
  - Oh I m sure it could be ; but I doubt it s actually in any previous versions .
- - Replace Birdman with Perk and that sounds like a complaint about Brooks . By the way if you wan na trade Spo for Brooks I m down
  - Scott can turn young bloods into all stars right  Sigh me up .
- - Sleeping and dying  He takes dying calmly
  - He s dying but he can still tell me to not loiter ...
- - This might be the greatest thing i have ever read .

- - And you keep revealing your vast lack of understanding when it comes to the challenges of game development .
  - And now you re just dodging questions .
- - Holly dickbutt  it sort of reminds me that picture of that goat with his horn stuck through his cheek . OP  do nt let it come to that 
  - The only danger my face is in from my stache is sleeping on my side and having it poke me in the eye . True story .
- - Shot through the heart  your to late . You re going to need  a band aid .
  - Im pretty sure its waaaaaaay to late for a band aid if your shot in the heart
- - First time RekSai . Felt useless and thought the champ is crap tier .
  - Did some hard cc and slow get ya 
- - Plus  the Hannibal character believed that she was dead .

- - To much contrast  it does nt blend well enough . Needs less glowstone .
  - This is a futuristic city so this is the style .
- - A guy wanting to have sex with you says nothing more then he probably finds you somewhat physically attractive .
  - Somewhat being the key word . Or it could also just be getting close to last call .

  - What it does for most of the rest of the year  hold conventions in it .
- - this mentality of MS also explains how skype is easily the worst app on my android phone . such talent but such a shitty product .

  - The fact that you say he s defending himself proves you do nt understand what he said .
- - What would be your job if you were nt caster 
  - He worked for a web development company before he was casting .
- - I had to read this for Honors English too . Sounds really good and it s pretty impressive . Animal Farm AKA the book that has communist pigs 
  - Im in CCP  so yay for me  . p
- - Yes  to try and separate Politics from History is ludicrous an absolute absurdity . These things are inseparable and deeply interconnected .
  - As i have already stated I am an archaeologist discussing archaeological evidence only it appears I m discussing it with myself . Not everything is political .
- - No overheat damage  Filthy casual . Nice save nonetheless .
  - My alt did nt have Thermodynamics there . Realized it a bit too late .

  - that sounds like the opposite of a problem to me
- - This is why people do nt like stereotypical Americans .
  - Oh yes  Now pull my hair and spit on me 
- - No-one has really tested that Amex contract yet . We ll see if the wording is strict after a couple of years has passed .
  - well  i m crossing my fingers  seems kinda ridiculous to not let you get the bonus after multiple years .
- - Will they try some damage control first or just go straight to dropping the charges 
  - Paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation blah blah blah charges dropped as soon as the public has something else to latch onto .
- - It s funny until you realise that TV does nt work like that .
  - It s still funny even with that knowledge .
- - Oh man . It if she eats the wrong thing and gets gas  That could kill it .
  - Literally . Is TRP too mature for a fart joke 
- - Why would you not want a d-pad 
  - Just seems like that controller puts a lot more emphasis on the D-pad instead of a stick . I rarely use the D-pad for anything but old school games .
- - Good . Sadly in their community they will be seen as martyrs .
  - Could nt have said it better myself . Also glad all the hostages appear to be safe .
- - Such a pretty image  would love to make a trip one-day . Do you know if its like that often 
  - It should be on a dry clear night . It was stunning to be able to see that .
- - Looks like the train is turning to the north because it s on the right side track .
  - Yep - I was nt paying enough attention to that . So this is probably coming from the west and turning north here .
- - May they find peace and realize their true home .
  - Thank you very much . This means a lot to me .
- - WTF is sweet tea  No I wont google it . My guess is . Tea  with sugar .
  - Close  it s tea with entirely too much sugar .

- - all of these convenience store three minute meals articles really embody the spirit of shittyfoodporn
  - Yeah  I probably should ve milked it for a while before revealing my source .
- - cameron is there checking on naomi getting jumped backstage . can you seriously not keep up THAT storyline 
  - Why would you want to  Who would ever want to see Cameron in a wrestling ring again

  - RES shows you the title right above the picture .
- - Sad bastard has read too many Chick tracts methinks .
  - I read those things and shake my head wondering how people can think that way .

  - U do not see that when on the app .
- - How did you get the prerelease banners 
  - My lgs got extras and I asked .
- - This would have been the perfect time to ask for a raise . She would have said yes just to get you out of her office .
  - I WISH . I actually work for the government so she would have to get my sudden raise approved by the higher ups which requires an explanation and proof .
- - She forgot that she just finished that question . So it is entirely possible she forgot what the Super Bowl was again .
  - I think it was more - she forgot to edit it out .
- - zero cars does nt seem like a way for me to maintain my schooling and internship  Also  get rid of as in 
  - What about public transportation to get to and from school and internship
