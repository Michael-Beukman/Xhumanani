- - Psst ... KIA ... we can still see you .
  - They re kind of like that small child who tries to sneak past you with their hands over their eyes .
- - To be fair  when pets get sick  they shit and piss and vomit all over the place . Cats especially can get their vomit in amazing places .
  - Fortunately I have nt had that experience with them .
  - I hope you never do . We have a cat that I swear vomits in places that are hard to clean up on purpose .
  - I also have a bulimic cat . Thankfully she stopped vomiting on my bed .

  - yes  it is  but i liked this video  so i just shared this here .
- - Omg your life seems to be looking up I m so glad to see this

- - Not sure how I feel about that from the crowd .
  - Yeah  must ve felt pretty bad for the actual guy who got it .

  - I thought they were the new BVCs to replace old BDC coils .

  - The title really hurts it I think . It sounds nothing like a scifi movie . Sucks because i heard it s real good
- - i hear it gives your goalies a loss if they quit on you . i was wondering why my goalies had terrible records .
  - This is true  u get the win but goalie gets a loss in stats and gets fatigued
- - I do nt think killing anyone who comes within fifty yards of your babies is good behavior for human parents .
  - I was referring to the lengths they go to to protect their babies . I mean  they re just incredible  . D

  - She deleted me at some point apparently .
- - No . They are nt correlated in that way .

- - Off by one  Feels just like the real lottery 
  - And just like real lotto  try and try again . Good luck for next time 
- - How does it run if there are nt any pedals  I do nt see any in the tub . If they re hand controlled that s just stupid .
  - It looks like there may be two controls just in front of the steering wheel .
- - Stop repeating that shit . Eating slow carbs is more helpful than eating fast carbs if you want to lose weight .
  - What would be an example of some slow carbs 
- - Well technically they are playing Cinderella and he s not lying to her ...
  - Lol I was joking . I meant this is nt a very dark confession
- - Oooh  what color is that  I like how wearable it is 
  - It s On The Mauve by Maybelline
