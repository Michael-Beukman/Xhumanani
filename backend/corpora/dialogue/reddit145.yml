  - A drunk moose  So essentially Greg Monroe

  - I agree it can look similar  if you had the cyanogenmod boot logo you re on cyanogenmod .

  - Shadow price is pretty good too . Right on par with a suros
  - That s a pre-DLC weapon . Which means it s no longer available .
  - I yesterday got it from a legendary engram . less attack stat than my for the people  still does more dmg in both PvE and PvP .
  - You can still get it as a drop but you ca nt buy it from the Vanguard anymore .
- - A nice guy is nice to everyone pretty equally  while a flirting guy will treat you above and beyond any other girls around .

- - Is nt there a porn movie along these lines 
  - If there is nt one their should be
- - Broken hand is bothering him  shit is nt really that mysterious

- - Call the postal police and tell them what you witnessed .
  - That sounds so fake I m not sure if serious or sarcastic . But I will go ahead with contacting the postal service just to be sure .

  - This is a very old case  the Newsroom plot is probably based on this .

  - True . I guess it s fortunate to be able to see the story in color .
- - Pretty pathetic that a conversation on the freedom of expression existing in all of us is too serious for you .
  - Your comment right here is why I removed it . Topics like this have a tendency to bring out the worst in people and have no place in this sub .

- - pinhole leak somewhere  probably in the seal at the top . leaked out .
  - Looked everywhere for a hole . Even submerged it in water to see if there were bubbles and there was nothing .
- - What kind of water bottle is that 
  - It helps determine if you ve had enough water for the day depending on age  weight etc
- - That s not spongebob . That s patrick .
  - If you look closer  you can see SpongeBob behind patrick .
- - Do you need a credit card for the free games now 
  - When you go to purchase make sure it says free
- - That s very sweet and humble of you .
  - Not really ; he got a lot from his adopted country  and his country has suffered from acts committed in the name of his religion .
- - I had this same problem . You ve got ta turn on vsync on nvidia control panel .
  - You were right  turning on vsync completely solved the problem .
- - Two jerseys on the ice  a few hundred dollars down the toilet .
  - After the way they played i m not surprised .
- - I have a wiiu . It s the most expensive hulu player I own . Too bad there are nt many games ...
  - Why did you get a Wii U when you knew there were nt that many games you d enjoy playing  Did you purchase it without doing any research beforehand 
- - It s not a crutch  its a safety
  - The safety part comes by not trying to operate a device you have no idea how to control .
- - How did I never hear that one before for fucks sake .
  - Some tell him different . How do you know Yorick is gay  He totally digs Graves .
- - Do fakes work as long as they pass barzapp

  - But now I want sausages for lunch .
- - I understand . I m still waiting for Whiplash .
  - Oh me too . So excited to see it

- - No  that was Alan Rickman . Have nt you seen Dogma 
  - Indeed . They also got God wrong . No boobs and all .
- - Seriously though . And even though the challenger is gorgeous as well I love me a sedan .

- - I was wondering when Jeff started advertising HTC .
  - Yeah  He should drop Panasonic  and pick up HTC

- - The card is completely straight forward without knowing any surrounding context
  - I am the undisputed champion of pickle tossing .
- - I wonder who we ll be going after for our recruiting coordinator position now .
  - Lance Anderson was Stanford s recruiting coordinator IIRC  so probably him if he does go to Michigan .
- - Yes  I meant what difference does it make in the watch 
  - The watch is what it is . The difference is between your statement being true or false .
- - You get it  I m adding you right now
  - Thanks a ton man  I ve been trying to get this game for a while now  Thanks for being the one to do it 
- - By attacking with a lot of creatures .
  - Doh  We d hoped you would nt figure it out so quickly 
- - That Alabama non fumble was fucking weird . I really want to see more angles than what we saw because I m still confused by it .
  - yeah  I thought it looked incomplete  or a fumble  but definitely not down by contact .
- - All I m finding on the app are promo videos .
  - Same here . Searched all over the app and it s all promos

  - Thank you SO much  Definitely share the love and the video to others 
- - TIFU by taming a dragon but forgetting about the other one behind me .
  - TIFU by getting wasted on a hunting trip .
- - T ON KD  What the hell happened 
  - Probably running his mouth about the moving screen call . I rewound the play and KD was still moving but Andre def exaggerated the hit .
- - May I ask  why  I know a select few people use the default player skin but I ve never asked . Thanks 
  - I just do nt take the time to customize it .
- - Well it was crap i answered the questions didnt i 
  - you most certainly did . Good job kind sir .
- - I was a hater before but now I was actually rooting for them since they are shit . I want to see them loosing finals not loosing qualifier first rounds .
  - exactly the same with me but with Alliance .
- - And Google Now on long press home button  and split screen apps on long press back button .
  - I was nt aware of the long press back button for split-screen . Thanks 
- - Did nt you hear  Jed York wants us to hold him accountable . Just not in any tangible or theoretical way .
  - He s interested in your proposals though  ha ha ha .
- - yes  Australia . highly unlikely imo . Do you know if the rides are working during winter time 
  - Yes  everything is working normally in winter . Shoot ... I m really not sure which to recommend  then . They re both quite good .
- - I m getting the same problem  Ca nt listen to music in my car anymore because a slight bump in the road will cause Now to pop-up .
  - Me too  When voice mate pops up I wiggle my aux cord and it shows that there is some noise going on but it never understands . I hate it 
- - we probably need our own shin guards to play 
  - Shin guards will not be provided but since this is just a casual kick around feel free to play without them .
- - Denied . Poland is not active as of yet .
  - What  But  I thought ... Okay . Can I still have the radio research update 
- - I know the feels  And the constant refreshing XD
  - Haha ... Having fast circulation of blood over a free pokemon is something to spice up life ... Kinda exciting ... XD
- - the one villager i want and i m minutes late i m heartbroken .
  - D . OMG I m so sorry  I saw your post before  But I did nt know you would reply soon  My apologies

- - I think you re being too hard on your mom . You only get one . Be nice .
  - I love my mum dearly  not being mean really 
- - Ah well  fair enough  sorry for jumping the gun . Still should nt have used it in the title  really . Down vote removed .
  - You are entitled to your opinion . Thanks for the feedback .
- - why did you give the weight in pounds so many decimals  made me have to look twice xD
  - That s how it looked when I changed it to lbs . Also I did nt know where to cut it off and not ruin it
- - Problems with the article title . Is it possible to discover something that is mythical  Why is the g in God capitalized when the d in discover is not 
  - The myth of Osiris tomb predates when this tomb was constructed .
- - this should be enough  if its not  you re with a bunch of kids .
  - Yeah . Im going over to their place to chill and party . If anyone brings it up Ill just shrug and say i fucked up . Live and learn i guess
- - OMG that s amazing  Love it .

- - Aphex Twin s name is right there . In the picture .
  - Yeah I m an idiot . I was looking for Richard James  and somehow missed R. James .
- - Ranked play  disabled weapon traits  no supers . I would play the fuck out of this .
  - Screw disabled weapon perks . Besides the supers  it s the variety of weapon perks that set pvp apart from other games .
- - I duct taped my ssd to the side of my case . Has worked fine for over a year .
  - Yeah  I think im going to just duct tape it . Thanks 
- - i thought das was a no kill shelter 
  - Many no-kill shelters simply ship the undesirables off elsewhere .
- - You watch Harry Potter on a second monitor ... I let the dulcet tones of Stephen Fry read Harry Potter to me in audiobook form .
  - And on my second monitor  I watch QI with Stephen Fry hosting .
- - Eh dont worry about them . We are actually very happy to have you here . Welcome to America  You commie fuck
  - Guess that s one way to express hospitality . p
- - Not bad  but not great either .
  - Sounds like a neutral day what happened 
  - Well highschool is the negative part  but half of my schedule is band so it is nt that bad .
  - Hey man enjoy high school when you can  it doesnt get much easier after it  band sounds fun though  what instrument do you play 
  - Brass in general . Trumpet is my principal  but trombone is a close second for favorite .
  - Nice  I tried out band  but it wasnt me  I learned how to use a guitar in the process though 
- - Nope . I ve tried Blue Dream which is a good go-to strain  and Wet Dream which was also pretty dank  but never White Dream .
  - Yeah  I heard blue dream is pretty good too .
- - thanks from supporting from down under  Do nt spill any Foster s on it  and keep it away from the barbie  Just kidding
  - You know  I drink a lot of beer  and I ve seen maybe one can of Fosters in my entire life .
- - I imagine if transported back in time  the hambeast would be hunted for its valuable whale oil .
  - Either that or they d be in freak shows .
- - If someone has a fatal grass allergy  their life truly sucks .
  - The hard part about this is the victims staying alive long enough to be murdered .
- - How about anyone who does nt like free speech can fuck off .
  - Hey  you ca nt say that 
- - Do nt you know  It s okay to be racist if your token black friend goes along with it 
  - It s like diplomatic immunity . Now you ca nt be mad that I m a bigot  I have a representative of you people giving me clearance .
- - I used to live on cimber lane  weird
  - That IS weird ... you dog snatcher ...
- - Quick question for clarification s sake before I post . should the pictures i m posting be pre or post editing in lightroom 
  - as you would show or print them ... the best you can make them with the knowledge you poses at this time
- - And as someone with kids ... mute it if their screaming or your partner is yelling at them or basically if anything kid related is near the mic .
  - My buddy has kids and they are absolutely adorable through the mic . But yeah  screaming  I just unplug myself so I do nt have to hear it .
- - That picture is really depressing for some reason .
  - actually i laughed when i saw it . it looks so surreal yet plausible .
- - Divinity has an interesting take on co-op with its dialogue options . But it s really weird when you play alone .
  - Eh  I did both  the player dialog in that game is hamfisted and dumb with really lazy jokes and nothing particularly interesting .
- - I think that s just a sign that the garden is slightly less broken than the mine . I really wish gathering professions still had value .
  - This was my reaction as well . A very minor advantage to having herbalism  while mining seems utterly useless at this point .
- - One of the strangest ways ive seen a table break . That one half just decided dislocate itself and jump away
  - It s because they re medical grade tables . You can tell by the red crosses on them .
- - I m a ginger . Can they still touch my butt 
  - I m sorry  I ... i do nt know how to tell you ...
- - Who s that motherfucker flying around in the background 
  - You do nt remember that from history class 
- - I asked if her vagina smelled like pine today ... no one got the reference or replied .
  - That s a quote I still use to this day . Also  I m a guy .
- - I would hope you d get watchespn access online just like if you had a regular cable plan now .
  - WatchEspn sucks . It s super laggy and sometimes does nt even have the stuff that ESPNU has on .
  - yes  the watch espn android app now supports chromecast . I havent had any issues with any games this season .
  - Sweet . I m switching to that then 
- - When you examine it it says that it s inactive . That might mean that we wo nt be able to use it yet or we need to activate it somehow .
  - Yeah  that s primarily what I m trying to work out - can it be activated  If so  what might we need to do 
- - This is not the appropriate time for the birds and bees talk  dude .
  - Do you think they hate you for your freedoms  Or is it wars  coups  and drones 
- - Goddamn dems some cute shoes . And butt ... and everything else .
  - Yeah twerking santa is now my fetish .
- - It s a monopoly on certain games  but not all . Plus they still compete for your time and miner which are limited resources .
  - agreed  Hence why i said not so much vs not at all . then again i suck words .
- - At the game . Fingers crossed for another Patty goal .
  - At home . Fingers crossed for another Patty goal .
- - I get nervous fairly easily . I m pretty sure two of them would for sure . I ll give it a go .
  - Ok  just talk to those ones you feel you can . What about parents 
  - That is a likely conclusion . Dad is more understanding in situations like this .
  - Do you think you could have a chat with him 
  - Yes  as a base . Maybe the clean slate as a back up .
  - Yeah . Probably wo nt come to that hopefully
  - We shall see . Thanks for the chat . You ve helped me a lot today .
  - It s fine . Message me as to how things go or if you need more help
- - How d you get the angle for this 
  - She s laying in a slight hill and I held my phone out over her . It helps that I m quite tall with long arms .
- - Who are some of your other potential drops  Definitely would nt drop Monroe .
  - jared sullinger is the only other player id risk dropping  but besides a bad december hes been great this year and last year .
- - I m more of a lurker and do nt really come out of hiding much . How do I cross post  . X
  - You just post this in that sub  too .
- - Yea  I snack too much and go for second helpings  if I stopped that I would be just fine  I just need to actually do it .
  - The workouts are essential . Do something physical for at least a half hour every day . Just cutting calories never worked for me .
- - What item build order did Voy go here does anyone know 
  - Tear  Rylais then whatever suits the situation .
- - And this is one of the reasons I am so relieved that the expanded fanon bullshit is going the way of the dodo .
  - It ll still show up on TIL  though 
- - I do nt think he understands the concept of formats  considering the start of his comment .
  - Then even more so he should nt be watching game streams .
- - Slices of toast that you dip in the egg yolk
  - Served best with a nice hot cup of sweet tea .
- - Good . St. Louis is nt a football town . The Rams should be in LA .
  - You could definitely argue that LA is not a football town either .
- - That was ... actually a good save . . O
  - He makes good saves not look good somehow . It s like he flinches whenever the puck gets close to him ...
- - You re pulling its skin so much it s close to being choked  hence the open mouth .
  - There s a lot more to the story than what you see .
- - Hopefully they shoot these fuckers down  rather than put them in prison like they do in the US .
  - That s probably what they want . So it s not really an option ...
- - I d like to live in space  on the moon  or preferably  on mars .
  - Definitely Mars . Or  I mean  the Enterprise . That way you get to travel through space  and visit many planets .
- - This was fun to watch . I think it s helpful watching same elo game play and not just pro level game play .
  - Thanks man  I plan on making a lot more  so stay subbed for more  Thanks for the comment
- - Not what the guard had in mind when he said he was getting shit faced later .
  - Well played . Please take my up vote .
- - Fuck it Pistons going to the playoffs as the eighth seed .
  - If we keep playing the way we are we can possibly get to six as long as the Bucks have a miniature meltdown .
- - The game has nt changed  but the publicly distributed instruction manual has . We re just using the old playbook .
  - This  alas its  changed a bit - material security is now abundant and therefore less important .
- - Fucking hell  that s some serious benefit of the doubt shit for criminals
  - Yeah . It s bold  I ll give them that .
- - These all seem good to me  assuming you have arches
  - Excuse me  but why would I need arches 
- - Yeah I ll trade for that  could you teach it encore though . D What would you like for it 
  - What move do you want deleted  Also would I be able to get a copy back  I d like shiny scolipede and mega aggron
- - Sweet brother  They kept it pretty quite then 
  - Yeah  it wasnt something that was announced publically .
- - Go max protection . No more empty set ffs .
  - we ve been so good in that set though
- - I do nt really follow -- but I have no intention of being the public face of this . I do nt want to focus on scams or allegations of scams .
  - Ok never mind then . Maybe I misread your intention here .
- - Imagine how beautiful she would be without drugs
  - Personally I think more drugs would be required to find her attractive
- - The Founding Fathers were Christians ; America a Christian Nation .
  - The fact that they were not overly obsessed with religion does nt exactly make them atheists either ... They did institute a separation for good reason though .
- - Sorry I meant that they had more than just a bit of luck .
  - Agreed mate . The stars aligned and it was beautiful to watch it happen  for a neutral .
- - They discussed every mustache man who also has a cool name . They went for the cool name  but I agree .
  - Could have named him Magnum as well 
- - Turns out you re just shit at PvP .
  - Turns out you have a chubby for an op gun
- - Party Cannon s debut album is coming out 
  - I ca nt wait for that . It should be hilarious and amazing with all those samples .
- - wait  do you mean you have chronic bad pain or post workout good pain 
  - Ah  chronic bad pain  not good pain . The good pain cancels out the bad pain for a little bit though  and that s nice .
- - Darth Vader s head  but with Luke Skywalker s head inside .
  - And inside Luke Skywalker s head  head there is of Master Yoda
- - on a modpack for world of tanks someone made an option for voiceovers from the girls of this anime . best mod ever .
  - Where would I be able to get this 
- - Maybe OP uses cat pictures to convey their secret communications in plain sight .
  - Well  I guess the cat is out of the bag ...
- - Oh how I miss Orlando and the themed parties . Great costume and I really like your mask 
  - Thank you  I m sorry you are nt around any  D .
- - I m pretty much against the death penalty  but if we could bring back the guillotine and public executions I could be talked into it .
  - They have those in Saudi Arabia  except they use swords .
- - Any colts fan up for either a food or gear bet 
  - How crazy are we talking  And is it just a straight winner take all 
- - Hot  Are you normally a briefs man 
  - Haha I wear boxers usually and boxer briefs on occasion ... but usually still fairly tight .
- - Aaaand the Vegas crowd makes their shittiness heard .
  - Terrible crowd . Kills all the hype . So frustrating .
- - His talk is mostly to try help his bets on the market .
  - What is the difference between what you said and putting your money where your mouth is 
  - A strong incentive to make more money by scaring people away from the stock market and towards bonds  that s the difference .
  - To a hammer every problem is a nail . To a bond trader ...
- - The people saying this game is over are nt fans of either team . We know FSU can come back  and no duck fan is ever confident in our lead .
  - I m fans of both and I m just sad
- - Great pickups  where did you score them 
  - At my local swap meet . Some lady had a table full of hot wheels .
- - Time for LGD to kick sylar and sign zyf . Every carry for LGD has become a legend so far . ZSMJ  Sylar  rabbit . D
  - Sylar to fall  Zyf is doing it 
- - Dayum . Jelly . Need to remember to take photos for the next Denver get-together .
  - Online groups are fun  but nothing beats getting a bunch of whiskey nerds together in one place and geeking out a little bit .
- - I pay more for someone to visit my dogs twice a day for an hour total .
  - I pay the same rate to feed my cats once a day and change the litter every third when I m on vacation .
- - You really are a dim  super boring troll . Good luck with that shit life of yours 
  - Tucking tail already  Alright  good luck with the cross dressing and jewelry making .
- - wait the fuck up  did he just stick another centipede in his ear 
  - No it was the first one he just never took it out  so it s been eating his ear for the length of his capture .
- - The Master Sword was created by the goddess Hylia  who later was reborn as Zelda . Saying it is Zelda s sword is not inaccurate .
  - It seems my understanding is lacking  then .
- - Thanks  I think you re right then .
  - No problem at all  I should ve pulled the link in the first place .
- - That s cool and all  but I feel like I m more likely just to have a lighter in my pocket than gum  a loose battery  and scissors .
  - That s why you ll never be MacGyver .
- - Finland should be in this comic  have you seen their food 
  - Their food has nt got the reputation of being the WORST food in the world .
- - This is fucking genius . Would you and the homeless guy do battle then  or what 
  - I had nt actually thought that far ahead .
- - I ca nt be the only one who gets scared every time we try to field a punt
  - Have for years . Did nt think anyone could get my blood pressure up quite like Philly Brown but to hell if Marshall does nt scare me more .
- - Jesus Christ these special teams are fuckin  special alright .
  - They re taking the short team bus back to Arizona all right .
- - It s a name . ; p The English equivalent would be Reginald or some variant .
  - ooohhh  ok  hahaha  merci beaucoup .
- - If you ca nt grasp the idea of social policy  then you have no business being part of the discourse . Some Randian ideologue has nothing to offer .
  - Spoken like someone who ca nt think of anything intelligent to say . Better luck next time .
- - Probably tupperware and some cardboard  have a ton of both lying around
  - I got this case for xmas with my quad . I love it . It holds everything tight and safe . I think it s worth it .
- - That a thick fucking copper cable . I ve seen a cross section up close . It s impressive .
  - Pretty sure they re not piping an optical signal through copper .
- - Chunks of plastic in your snow cone  huh 
  - Naw . Just really inconsistent . Sometimes it would make snow sometimes nothing would come out .
- - Is he losing weight  He looks a bit skinnier than he did on his stand up special . And that s a good thing 
  - Money is tight . He had to cut back on vending machine cupcakes .
- - That was a REALLY bad throw . Come on  Cardale
  - He is third string for a reason .
- - He does nt use your compound  he uses mine . It s a secret formula of animal semen and essential oils . It melts away fat while repairing muscle tissue .
  - He does nt use your compound  he uses mine . It s an ISIS guerilla insurgency training compound in Iraq
- - Joique Bell is actually an inspirational story ESPN  not what you did with Jeremy Hill earlier .
  - Yeah  I also thought it was a good story .
- - I d just call my dad . He s a jail warden so i m pretty sure it d be sorted
  - He s probably the reason you re being kidnapped 
- - Shes building the sandwich in her stomach  shes going to eat an entire ham next .
  - Loaf of garlic bread locked and loaded 
- - Cool . Did nt realise it could learn all those moves 
  - Yup . If it werent for his ability  he d definitly be Uber .
- - I hate when people use wealth in this context . So what if he s rich  That does nt mean that he s not getting shit on .
  - My point is that his talents are obviously being recognized  MVP or not .
- - I never use a pot  I should get one .
  - Good news  They actually have tea storage pots 
- - Rookie move  Guy . Now you get no allowance .
  - Well he ll have housing  water  electric  sewage  food  TV  clothing  and health care all paid for the rest of his life .
- - You mention low dose E  but what about your T levels  Are you on anything to suppress testosterone  E ca nt do much while T levels are nt lowered
  - Of course . Apparently my T is female range .
- - I d kill to have Lauryn hill sing a hook for Kendrick . Not to mention actually drop a guest verse .
  - Oo man  me too . No doubt  she would kill it .
- - More like worst of . This post reeks of self righteousness and encapsulates the worst aspects of this site .
  - Completely agree with you . There was nothing non-judgmental about his view . Literally nothing .
- - It s shit HARD to get to . You ll find hitmen  drugs  and all other crazy illegal shit .
  - Not really  install tor and go to onion index sites .
- - I thought castoffs were supposed to go to Auburn  If so  huge get for Alabama over their rivals .
  - Well  the joke would be first he has to get denied by Alabama and then he can move on to Auburn .
- - Should nt be something we have to do to make sure we drop with the mechs we want though is the thing .
  - well yeah it is a bug  but he is saying a way you can fix it so this doesnt happen .
- - Another fun fact . the reason the girl s colour is pink now and the boy s blue is because of Hitler . Yes  literally fucking Hitler .
  - No way  really  Man  the more I hear about that guy the more I start to think he s a bit of a douche 
- - Any itching recently  Have you been exposed to anything you are allergic to 
  - Does nt itch . No resent exposure to anything im allergic to . It just was there ons dat without any known reason .
- - This makes a ton of sense  Thank you so much .
  - NP . I suffer from em but I ve since learned to manage my heart anxiety . It s electrolytes all the way down .
- - Babysitting taught me that children need food and oxygen to live  apparently
  - And that you can use a pillow to make them quiet .
- - Are there other custom vehicles that can be sold  I know of the Sandking  Ratloader and now this  but are there others I do nt know about 
  - We are all still learning about the others . If I find more I ll put out more videos about them .
- - How about gameplay focused players  Or those who love Dungeons or Organized instances 
  - Those players left the game . And they only check this sub once in a while to see if Anet change anything . I am one of them .
- - We officially invite you to join the South American Federation  a democratic federation of South American nations 
  - Peru accepts the invitation to the South American Federation .
- - You are your body . It s not some kind of symbiote living aside from your brain .
  - To be fair  these peoples brains seem to be parasites that are destroying their poor stupid host - the body .
- - Back before the BCS we would be saying it .
  - Uhhh yeah  that was par for the course before the bcs  also  water is wet .
- - In order to consistently find games against good people you need to queue up with people that are also good .
  - I m going to try some other game modes and see if I can find some higher level players .
- - I can trade with you . Do you have the car camping pass as well 
  - No  unfortunately they re just the GA tix .
- - The Battle of New Orleans ... I mean Old Hickory .
  - It s a shame few Americans could even tell you what that was ...
- - Thanks for the suggestions  Definitely going with Copper .
  - NP  just be sure to expect you re in for a long run grinding and leveling runes for him . He really needs ridiculously good runes .

- - So you mean light can have momentum then 
  - Yes  I m just saying it how I think about it  and momentum did not come to me .
- - Grand Theft Auto V. That game was lived up to its hype pretty well 
  - One of the best single player campaigns I have ever played 
- - I do nt care who I give it out to  I just have to trust them not to change my password lol .
  - Why do nt you just change it back 
- - Makes sense  I d sign except that I consider it undemocratic to participate in politics that I m categorically unaffected by .
  - If that view was common  the civil rights movement never would have happened .

  - they are sources with information . they in no way prove the paranoid claims being asserted .
  - then why do you take the US governments word on what happened .
- - Is it snowing  Better build some sides and add some weight to that  cause right now its just a burnout machine .
  - We live in Buffalo  NY and the genius pulls this in the middle of winter
- - I understand why they are saying they did nt see the tape  but did nt we all know what happened in that elevator before we saw the tape

- - I wish we signed Revis before Chung . I think its harder for us to use Chung effectively if we dont have Revis .
  - Then again  this may mean that the chances of Revis getting extended are better . Why would we resign Chung if we would nt be able to use him effectively 
  - Nail on the head . Chung is a feel good story but is only playing so well because of Revis and  Mccourty

  - If you want to do multiple tote auton . I do nt know . This is giving me something to do today .
- - There s no world that he misses that shot either . Like I ca nt picture THAT stepback followed by a brick .
  - When Kemba fully crosses up his defender doing that I m really not sure I ve seen him miss . That move rarely fails . He should do it every possession .

  - Good to know  Though ... smaller is subjective . This guy was a good size . Like i said  I m going to comment with some other pics .
- - They must have been overshadowed by yours  . D
  - lol  You must be mistaken because I do nt have any haha

  - You have much to learn young padawan .

  - honestly  i just looked up eagle and went with whatever came up  it may or may not have been the red tailed hawk s cry
- - That s fair  though I m not police . All I m trying to drive at is if you want consistent professionalism  you ve got to pay for it .

- - Gavin would make quite the teacher . He would just confuse every student until they understand everything .
  - It s like the Socratic method  except you ask nonsensical questions until the student arrives at the answer .
- - I would expect them to know this before investing so much in SETI  no 
  - success is nt always the only value in the search .
- - im pretty sure this sub is dedicated to playing a custom game .
  - Nope  I already tried to call people to play some Custom Games  did nt work .
