- - i m still trying to get that perfect hand heart photo
  - You can see my hands right beneath the heart starting to make one  wish it had been mine 
- - yeah the idea is that Puff is supposed to be feminine even back then  I mean you can reasonably assume a random girl you see on the street is a female
  - Sounds about right to me haha Also  is your username from things fall apart  great book .
- - I guess the game thread I posted before this one was nt good enough  Oh well . Go gata .
  - There s got ta be a better way to deal with game and post game threads ... it s kinda bad currently .
- - How about having a rule to never hit anyone  or a rule to hit people based on their actions instead of their gender 
  - Well that s essentially it  save that some folks could use a good slap from time to time  god knows I ve needed it before
- - Petite lancero for the La Palina Black Label .
  - I m going to have to try this .

- - Pineapple . Let s just all sit down and give them a chance . I was opposed to but once you try it it s a new pizza experience for all .
  - Pineapple and onion is a fave of mine .
- - They could ve done better . It really lacks the energy of the original . And the vocals are just meh .
  - Yeah  overall it was a little disappointing . Personally  I think the Japanese XY theme is much better .
- - Wow nice to see this one here . Classic
  - I ve been ripping this album up lately . It s so good  definitely a classic that has fallen between the cracks
- - She thought you were an alien and wanted to see if you had different anatomy

- - I think Rob McElhenney might have a thing or two to say about that  jabroni .
  - I do nt think he will ... because of the implications .
- - poking fun at people who are a particular race is racist in my book .
  - It s not poking fun though . I d just subscribe to those twitters if I had one . It s the jokes themselves that are funny .
- - Does she go to any of the PAX expos 
  - I do nt think she s too welcome to PAX after the Lollipop Chainsaw episode  could be wrong though .
- - Yo what the fuck . This mother fucker is swinging a Katana few inches from a person head . Who the fuck is ok with this 
  - Yeah and he s not really checking behind him when he swings it around and it s quite clearly sharp .
- - Great  we can now get expensive  imported  expired stuff instead of fresh  local  organic produce .
  - You are beIng unfair . Not all the expired stuff is expensive .
- - Agree to give up something as well  to leverage his loyalty to you  and make him feel less alone in his struggle .
  - That s what I do  but I m not addicted to this like he his . This is much hard for him that it is for me ...
- - Who are you going to prom with 
  - Actually I m a sophomore  but I would love it if a certain senior would ask me
- - What do popsicle pretzel in baby John make we it  Completely original  never been asked .
  - That s not really a question . Try again . You re on the right track .
- - thats a problem with the general population if they disagree with being accepting of people for something they dont control

- - Lincolns have awesome interiors and ride  sometimes the power is meh but they are expensive cars .
  - They are overpriced versions of a Ford .

  - for me it fit right in perfectly  should be the same for you too 
- - I m pretty sure communism has been more thoroughly tested  and has more thoroughly failed .
  - Yup  and congress is now controlled by geniuses who think those are our only two options .
- - what are the ones on the right 
  - No clue dude  ca nt find either .
- - Articulated legs AND caterpillar tread feet  Why  So it can moonwalk 
  - Well that would be one way of backing up and it would be easier than trying to turn that monstrosity around I guess .
- - What do you want to add that is nt already Craigslist  Delivery  I do nt think there s anything online that does nt intimidate the older crowd .
  - Better categories  filtering  and sorting would be nice .

  - Or any city in Quebec for that matter .

  - Yeah it s UK only . Fantastic app though . No ads  free  great interface  good data .
- - They had this on YouTube before . You could hold right arrow or something when a video was paused to start a game of snake
  - They still have this - if you re quick enough to catch the loading circle .
- - No one is denying anyone anything . They have equal opportunity to get a job and make more .
  - Someone born in a poor neighborhood with a poor job market does not have an equal opportunity to make more than someone born in a wealthier area .
  - Probability is less  but the opportunity is there .
  - Than were talking in terms of practicality at this point in which case were gon na start talking about social programs and governments role which is a whole different conversation .
- - The guy in the back needs a drink ASAP .
  - he is thinking about the meaning of life ...
- - I ended up making a leather for it . Bought a sheet of leather and sketched it . Wet formed it and then let it dry and riveted it together .
  - Do nt store your knife in the sheath . Leather retains moisture and can lead to spotting
- - yes because you re a moron . i d hate to come across you in real life .
  - I assure you the feeling is mutual .
- - I did nt think that people would buy specific alts just for this server . God damnit .
  - Lmao  it s an old bk alt .

  - To be honest I ve never played breaking point but I definitely want to

- - Porn . Just to watch the world burn .
  - How dare that thought even enter your mind .

- - I would like to be mailed the syringes and liquids if possible ... PM me
  - I d like to be included in this mailing as well  for ... scientific purposes ... yeah .
- - It really seems like this happens a lot more with mainstream events . I never really see this at trance events  people are generally respectful of your personal space .
  - trance is the only genre that the word family follows . You never hear anyone go House family or trap family

  - Probably assassins  maybe the people directly under the president are actually spies who want him dead . That reminds me of some other movie .
- - The Cavs are nt that bad based on the stats  but the Mavs are just playing really good 
  - Second chance points are the biggest factor as always
- - That coon meat is lousy with parasites 
  - Why is this comment so low  This is the comment I came here for .
- - Imagine being one of those divers and looking straight down into the depths as it gets darker and darker
  - Thanks a lot . Now I know what tonight s dreams will be about .
- - Is adding distilled water preferable to adding VG 
  - Water would thin it  not thicken it .

- - and still playing for denial  i assume 
  - They left denial  but yeah he s with that team
- - Woot  Tootoo  Nice to see him get a goal .
  - Damnit this is faster than my game center feed
- - It s essentially copper . It s used in mechanisms as wiring with electrical analogues to the real world .
  - You just ruined his big long post with a single sentence . I still like OP s though .
- - A friend recommended sports bras . They re magic .
  - Just make sure you get the right size  mine is practically like binding XD
- - great job on finally maxing . it s always fun to see how long it takes people to do it  so that was a nice touch
  - Though it took me considerably longer than most  thanks for the support 
- - Answer a question with a question . Why are nt you taking a pay cut now that gas is cheaper 
  - Maybe because his wage did nt increase due to the increased price of gasoline 
- - Any coincidence its on Boston St  I like it .
  - How none of us have put that together shocks me  Good catch .
- - They re also located in New Jersey . Some of us wanted to support a team that was easier to get to .
  - You ll hear no argument from me on that point .
- - So what ll it be next week 
  - I m not sure  they said something about that in the pre game . Apparently the all star crew only does the Superbowl .
- - i wish it would take me an hour to roll on md  would stop me from chain smoking a q in a night oops
  - Haha  well I do a bit  put my arms down  find that position really comfy and then sit there for ages .

  - Ok but what makes you think we can automagically come up with someone s nudies

  - Foam looks more like carbonation in one on left  one on right looks more like agitated liquid .
- - It already has been for at least a year now . But you have to pay a fee .
  - Yep  that s the shitty tradeoff . You get the convenience of ESPN on your computer but you got to pay through the nose . It s a lame deal .
- - Would nt the last one on the right not count because your robot would have to go beyond the height limit to place them 
  - it would nt have to go beyond the height limit to place them
