  - You obviously have nt built the manly yorick . Muramana  Triforce  Hydra  IE  cdr boots  Cleaver

  - You still committed a crime . Which prove act us reas
- - Yo Dawg . I heard you like complaining so I put a complaining inside your complaining so you can complain while you re complaining .
  - would have been better if you said so I put a complaint inside your complaint so you can complain while you re complaining .
- - Oddly enough  I m not taking an iron supplement and my prenatals do nt have it . It remains a mystery . Good idea though

  - Yours is definitely a Rex . It has Rex fur .

  - Sounds like you re not drinking espresso . Not sure how a carafe fits into this 
- - Oh no  was it some sort of power surge 
  - I had thought of this  but my PC is on a UPS  and the UPS is still running fine .
- - ha  I think anyone who s had any sort of musical training will recognize that it s meant to be notes . Good song choice .
  - It took me a minute to realize the little b s were flats . I was really confused at first .

  - The storm troopers were a bunch of brainwashed clones .
- - Those alone would keep someone set for life  Sorry but I do nt buy that .
  - News flash but retirement is no longer an option for millions of people let alone wrestlers .
- - Why not just add the song one time and put the Playlist on repeat 
  - How do you put a playlist on repeat on spotify 
- - Do we have to have Samurai Helmets 
  - That d be a bonus  but it s not required 
- - I always suggest malwarebytes . Catches most everything if you do a scan every so often .
  - Great for reactive safety  not so much for pro-active . Malwarebytes should ideally be paired with an actual Anti-Virus such as Avast or AVG .

  - Yes . It does . Some of them exclude quotes from people who were there .
- - It s okay the Banks have been ripping us off for years .

- - Your starting weight is like exactly where I am now  kinda motivating .
  - Hey man  if I did it  you can do it too 
- - Was going to say that s a pipe dream of mine . i could only wish drs would talk like that .
  - Everyone should be that brutally honest all the time . Our society would benefit from it immensely
  - This is why I want to travel the world ; I want to get away from America .
  - We ve managed to export out fatness to the rest of the world  so good luck .
- - I wish I knew why I was laughing omg

- - As opposed to all the other deep insightful comments this sub is known for
  - It s known for gentlemanly compliments and insights into beauty .
- - Can anyone explain why he won this point 
  - If you touch a serve before it bounces  you lose the point . I guess that carries over to your racquet  even if you are nt touching it .
- - maybe they just do nt want to have to respond to dozens of messages at once
  - If he s wrong in dozens of ways  he should know about it .
- - Yea  but think of all the money you saved .
  - Ya and all the space you saved in your trophy case as well
- - Enjoys popping my pimples and always asks if she can do it .
  - Haha I know this feel all too well . I just want to cuddle and all she wanted was to pop my pimples .

  - I understand that it may not be but do either of us really know how accurate or inaccurate it is  If you do I d love to be educated .
- - Why do you guys like that so much  I ve heard that before .
  - You know like when a dog pisses on a fire hydrant to mark his territory  It s a similar thing here hahahaha
- - Because obese loudmouth Mcdonalds addicted angry war loving gun nut seems a bit excessive .
  - You can find em . Hell  I meet half of those .
- - Get into BIOS and check if the HDD is listed as a boot device .
  - Well  when I booted from the USB flash drive I had to enter boot menu  and the HDD was one of the options .
- - Am I the only one who likes Volchenkov s play over Bartley 
  - They both have their own downsides . I ve liked Bartley s play over the last few games a lot more  though .
- - I do nt think that was a penalty . Barely any actual contact
  - except the corner was nt playing the ball  he was playing the receiver  ergo pass interference . if he turns his head I do nt have a complaint .
- - He was wearing a Pistons top . Big No No
  - I know I should hate you for these comments  but they too funny .
- - Thanks all . Really dirty and would ve fooled me if I was more tired than I am now . Dirty tho
  - I just got the EXACT same message from that person . Scammer

  - It s almost like they are at the same theme park
- - that is literally the money store in a picture
  - It s literally the truest thing I have ever seen in my life .
- - This is exactly how I feel . It feels more like an origin story for the Inquisition  which is cool  but it feels ... incomplete .
  - Yeah . There s a lot of cool stuff  but I want more of it .
- - Bale was not that bad this game . Probably one of your best players today
  - Orbn was just really great  imo .

  - Pissed off the far right  you re doing Gods work .
- - Why the fuck did he bring her home during his own workout 
  - I dunno man but I had to rearrange my normal workout because I lost my spotter for half an hour on max out day
- - Sorry  but I ve heard this joke many times ...
  - Quite possibly a known joke  still a true story in this case .
  - I m sure you re right . The stewardess had probably heard the joke as well or something ...
  - Sounds about right  she s probably never found a better use for it though  tell you that 
- - That is a million dollar idea  I wish they had that offered here 
  - They might  they are nt well advertised around here . If I had nt known about the idea and sought it out myself I would never have known .
- - Godammit . Spoken as I spelled it .
  - It s always spoken pretty much that way .
- - This is why I m confused that Dr.Mario is so low on tier lists .
  - Because they only take the character into account and not the player .
- - ya got ta do whatcha got ta do
  - I just did nt know I could use them . This is huge to me .
- - The group surplus magic exchange on facebook is a place to sell used magic stuff . You could sell it off in lots .

- - What s the point of making a new East River 
  - to divert the flow from the old east river

- - It s not right for them to do it either .
  - But only one group seems to ever be the ones to face ANY sort of consequences for their abuse of the system .
- - Really  Look at Bamas opening game the past few years . Scheduling is not easy in this business .
  - they refused a home and home with us earlier . we were willing to fit into their time slots and give them a home game next year . they refused .

- - The Sun Belt is sitting there saying what about us 
  - Georgia Southern was nt eligible for a bowl  That s my lousy excuse  anyway .
- - Me  sure . But on behalf of my state  it s a resounding no . We always seem to be the last state to turn the corner on big issues
  - It s a little more liberal around the Mobile area . probably because we are closer to Florida .
- - even if Sony keeps Spidey I doubt they would keep Garfield because they do nt really like him much right now

  - I am still standing at attention and wo nt calm down .
- - Jesus edit . Goddammit  I thought I was so clever . Now I just feel like a predictable douchebag .
  - Jesus was nt fictional  the only controversy is regarding whether he is or is not the son of God .
- - Side question ... Who is more dominant at their respective position and separates themselves from the competition more . Watt or Gronk
