- - Agreed . Brotherhood is the peak of AC glory IMO . Altho I did enjoy the ship parts in Black Flag a lot .
  - The ship and massive world made me love it . Brotherhood still did a lot of things better than black flag though .
- - so normal grabs dont have invincibility frames  weird  I thought they all had them on startup .

  - I wonder why Barry J. Sanders did nt go to OSU like his dad then .
- - There s NO WAY the Muslims used Assault Weapons to commit these crimes  because they are illegal and therefore they could not have been available .

  - You seem very upset about all this . Perhaps you need an Internet break .
- - I m down  If you wan na swap addresses  I can totally send something to you as well 
  - Cool  I m gon na start writing some things 
- - Wonder what reading level BuzzFeed is classified as .
  - Since the reading level seems to be mostly determined by the length of sentences  probably quite high  because their titles are absurdly long .

  - Haha I know he s in the game I just want him as an amiibo
- - They saying there is a trade already 
  - hes in an extra s jersey . so he will probably be a healthy scratch tomorrow .

- - What is the best type for Mifune  Anima or breaker 
  - Breaker - He s meant to be a nuke
- - Thanks  your a life saver ... I assume sue would be the best option since the IDES is slow as balls .

  - No idea  but the DOL may be able to answer that for you .

- - I can say with confidence that I have never experienced any issues with my sound behaving that way .
  - I can reply with confidence that I believe you .
- - God I fucking hate mustard . I d do the same .
  - What  How  Mustards is the best condiment .

  - It s like you people think this guy is a beta fag lol .
- - There s only one thing Americans go to Southeast Asia for ... you re a sicko .

  - Whenever I hear them play Rush  or something of the like  in an arena it makes me smile
- - That is more of a paint grade maple . You can stain it but it stains at a much darker hue

  - A Michigan quarterback comforting a Ohio State quarterback .
- - I m here for the ridiculous overreactions .
  - Cavs with new bodies but same problems 
- - It sounds like he needs to keep seeing other doctors until he finds one that is nt completely clueless .
  - If he has seen ten doctors and none has been able to offer any help then maybe it speaks more about the problem he has than the quality of medical care .
- - The most fierce attacker ; a guy moving in slow motion and not reacting to anything you do .
  - It s a trap to create a false sense of security . Then he strikes .
- - Thats a tow bar so it can be pulled behind an rv ...
  - Some people should know something about cars before they post 
- - No information  but if anybody finds out please let me know .
  - I ve emailed them about it  I ll let you know what they say .

- - If you took the bus to Tennessee you would have gone past Texas .
  - But you might still be closer than you were .
- - could you give it up for adoption instead  or is that not a viable choice
  - That s a stupid choice . It involves the hardships and medical risks of a pregnancy  then dumps the child into an overburdened system .
- - Thank you for this  i ll definitely be reading those articles . Your response alone has given me a solid direction on where to start . Greatly appreciated 
  - Glad to help  Most of all - have fun learning

  - well I see how this can be seen as a first world problem ... my bad .
- - Bills man . We re talking Bills .
  - yea my mistake  i know its the bills i was typing browns as i was thinking about who they made the trade with

  - Thank you  I appreciate that . Monk is actually the one that trained me .
- - how do you get that free mystery box 
  - If you have nt been chat restricted or punished in the last year Riot sends it to you
- - Well obviously I pissed a lot of people off about it ...
  - Probably because it s not a good sentiment to look up to regardless of lifestyle choice . It s only fake internet points  anyway .
- - Hate  You seem to know my feelings towards the religious better than I  perhaps because you re making a flawed assumption . Care to try again 
  - The title was theatrical  the question is legitimate .
  - Then the question has a flawed assumption . Again  do you wish to try again 
  - It did not . What makes the hate different . You are implying that I made an accusation .
- - Nah  we won because we came back after stafford shit the bed . Shut up with the PI already .
  - Their sub is full of pissing and moaning right now  it s pretty great actually .
- - Probably Bloodstone Taric . It s actually a really cool skin that takes the character in a VERY different direction  but the cult following of Pink Taric has really overshadowed it
  - When playing Taric  it is important to maximize your fabulousness . That is why Pink Taric is best Taric
- - Any interest in selling The Hobbit code  If so  how much

  - What would nt you do with the third one 
- - The finish to the Jermain Taylor fight is like some Holywood shit .
  - That is the correct answer . That fight got me obsessed with boxing .
