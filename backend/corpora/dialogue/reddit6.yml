  - Do nt be too proud  I bet most of these were done by Mosque leaders looking for attention .
- - This has been brought up before . There s been some major delays for some tracks  and iirc  some tracks still have nt been released on Google Play Music .
  - Like Aura . It s not even out on Google Play .
- - Does the keyboard work with PC  and is it bluetooth or wired 
  - It does work with pc as does the trackpad  they both use bluetooth .
- - Steel key ring ... use it  or get the agility level up to use the shortcut  removing the need for the key
  - Well  something that I did nt know that existed . Thank you .
- - You cyclists can be as butthurt as you want but at the end of the day it does nt matter who is right  only who is alive .
  - Physics always win  and the car is usually bigger .
- - Galaxy Truckers would probably be a good rec  also 
  - Have nt played it yet  unfortunately . It appears to be crazy expensive  for some reason .
- - Just saw this . Replied to a comment
  - I m so glad this is still a thing .
- - You go into MCC  select Beta  and then play it ...
  - Ok it worked just like that  I tried that a few days ago and my Xbox was nt having any of it . Thanks though
  - So problem solved  If not you can try going through halo nightfall rewards to download it .
  - I hope it s problem solved  installing right now .
- - Not so much today . Thanks for making me one of your three .
  - What s wrong  D . your always a great friend 
- - Right  there s bust adjustments or elongating or other various processes to adjusting patterns . I was starting with a very basic method to visualizing before the finished product .
  - I mentioned it because a complete beginner would nt know to work on the paper pattern first .
- - This could be great but I do nt use unity . Tho I ve had been meaning to get to it .

  - Have nt gotten it pulled out yet . I got prescribed some antibiotics which helped . Making a dentist appointment soon to get them pulled though
- - I guess we found the one in the crowd with a small dick .
  - My dick is nt your concern  nor can you make me feel bad about my body . Sucks that you re a rotten human being though .
- - Lots of responses ... so I guess it d be not too good idea to ask you guys about your New Year s resolutions 
  - Quit smoking  get a job  grow a beard  save the world .
- - Yeah I m in England and this seems huge for one room .
  - It does sort of look like an attic conversion so it does nt seem too unworldly  especially for bigger houses in the country side .
- - I secretly wondered if Mike was attacking aria . Would nt be the first time .
  - mike is taller than whoever attacked aria - her attacker appeared to be not much taller than her .
- - I like Toradora  and I think its a pretty quality anime . But those ratings are reeeaaally inflated lol .
  - Quality shows deserve quality ratings  I do nt see anything wrong with it
- - What did you use  That s perfect 
  - Stila liquid liner with ud eye-shadow primer base 
- - I really dig the dracula movie poster ; a wonderful color choice .
  - Thank you  it is a Olly Moss style I wanted to try for that brief .
- - Yep . This is the best day of college football ever . Wait ... there s another game after this 
  - It might start during this game . So dumb
- - Excited to see what they ll have on the website .
  - Did nt they had a minecraft website last fall 
- - He did not have the expression of toying with someone during that fight  but I do concede there is nt concrete proof .
  - The entire point of Zoro is that he does nt care who you are or if you are a guy or girl . He only believes that skill matters .
- - They should remove Toughness and Blast Suppressor . They are the most staple perks in the game  if not the series . They shouldve been already put onto your character .
  - Yea I miss using scavenger or the system hack thing
- - I wish some doujin artists came out as pro-GG  then I d recognise some of these names .
  - TFW you can name more people who draw animu porn than people who actually have real sex on camera . I m right there with ya  bro .
- - Are they targeting Bam for any particular reason  Or just because
  - Dunno . He s barely even relevant these days .
- - What in the fuck did they do   How is it possible to mess your arm up THAT much  
  - Rolled his truck on the interstate . We studied this in paramedic school . He made a full recovery and kept all his fingers .
- - That last round . I was in stitches . Rob and Coe exchanging traitor weapons ; both being innocent and suspecting the other of being a traitor . Amazing .
  - The one error in Rob s logic was that Justin killed Coe .
- - This is such great news  So happy for you both .
  - Thank you . I am so stoked . . D
- - Maybe I m licking windows here but I thought that was onside .
  - So did I  surprised we did nt get a replay .

  - Yeah  that s what I meant .
- - Please do one for Baby Got Back .
  - Yeah  we got ta put this one on the list .
- - That s an illogical comparison and you know it . Comparing everything to slavery is just a way of shutting down the opposition . Please stop doing it .
  - It does its purpose . It shows you the holes in your argument . If it shuts down your point  your point has holes in it .
- - Despite the song being a tad overplayed  it does say something that more people really need to do .
  - I agree . Life s better when you let go of the little things .

  - yeah but how do I fix it and I dont want the HQM so I am free to delete it but I cant find it in the mods folder
- - I m actually more curious about which song they ll pick for the ending  but that might just be me .
  - No  I totally agree . I ca nt wait to see if they pick a song by DIO  or if they go with another pop song from that era .
- - You mean the pcb like stuff  the whole bridge or the actual connectors 
  - Well the connectors them self that plug into PCB slots
  - I see  no I did nt wrap the connectors because they are barely visible . I spray painted m silver to match the the top .
  - Ahh that makes a lot more sense  mind me asking what type of paint 
- - Is it straight or can it be fun 
  - I have like the coolest teacher  who i think smokes too . It has to be sort of educative but the guy ca nt stand a dull clip
- - Fun fact . in Australia we do not do this because we are not morons .
  - That s not to say we do nt have morons in Australia  but even they are nt of the level that treats a baby kangaroo like that .
- - This makes way more sense to me . Stockpile some left over mana for a bigger spell later . I like it 
  - But the part that truely makes it strange is that you can still cast what you exiled  even if cauldron is gone
- - They look good from what I can see  but it s a weird angle and we can only see half of the other one

- - Eat a burrito with no cheese  That s crazy talk .
  - Who said you ca nt have cheese

  - Well ... they did rule over us for several hundred years .
- - and what if learning different ways to conserve energy and create cleaner fuel is our equivalent of a virus adapting so as not to kill the host 
  - Also a good analogy . Nature is quite complex and adaptable .
- - You re the reason the rest of us ca nt get good drugs OTC .
  - You really think I m being serious  I ve never even taken a full scoop
  - Now you re being a pussy and an idiot .
  - Well you literally ca nt have one with out the other .
- - Im also having trouble aiming my gun on people in general . Its just frustrating .
  - That s the thing . It gives you another thing to make it all the more exciting . Making it harder to aim on flying people and dodging and stuff .
- - Yes AA . I understand you not liking the idea of AA . But maybe trade your ideas about it for the reality and see how they compare .
  - A fair and logical point . I will consider that
- - Go into Windows System Restore . Revert back to original  stable working driver . Do not update the nvidia driver .
  - So I need to back to when I first installed the first driver or back to the beginning and install the latest one 
- - Damn I want a car that tells me when I m low on weed .
  - I do nt need a car to tell me that
- - Images containing watermarks of illegal streaming sites are not allowed .

  - Well it s obviously not caused by a FEW extra pounds

  - Opt-in to beta . Update . Restart steam .
- - Dallas plays better on the road . This is nt news . They came back and played like they wanted it at the end . And that s all that matters .
  - I hope it is a good game either way  I am simply not picking Dallas to go beyond GB at this point ...
- - I get making a point and all . But sometimes  just giving your license and getting the verbal warning would be better than the hassle he now faces .
  - maybe for you  but to others  maintaing your rights as an American citizen may be more important for them .
- - So now  if I ever go to the UK I can partake in the slamming of Wales 
  - Wear gloves . Their police are adept at getting the prints of Wales .
- - i dont get this joke  either because i dont smoke or i dont eat chicken .
  - roaches are when its almost gone and you cant really hold it anymore . Those blunts arent even close to done .
- - no he said he gets the women he does because of confidence . he thinks that confidence is the deal breaker .
  - Even saying getting women  is gross . Everything you are saying is disgusting .
- - I knew immediately someone would post her  Thank you .
  - Yeah it was a great shot and a great reaction . She was pissed . I m waiting for someone else to make the gif so I can save it .
- - Are you still locked out now  It s been seven hours . You should quit smoking .
  - Nope I am all good now . However  I seriously considered quitting after this incident . Then I remembered I leave to go home on Friday and got over it .
- - mm did his cock burst pretty quick 
  - Indeed it did . She was nt terribly dissatisfied but I did have to make up for his lack of longevity . No complaints from me on that  ever 
- - Not that it s going to happen but if he was to fall out of the top ten I think the eagles would have to do it .
  - I certainly think they would try  if that were to happen .
- - Sounds like that would make a good show .
  - Nah  but I knew this guy a long time ago who used to ride motorcycles ...
- - Something simple to check . clean the MAF and throttle body .
  - Seconded . Super easy maintenance that should be done either way and it ca nt do any damage . Make sure to adjust idle speed accordingly after a good cleaning .

  - Dont know yet if i want to open source it . Ill think about it .
- - Well  yeah . But not the working hours thing  people work crazy hours here for no overtime everyday .
  - True . What are your thoughts on productivity in jpn  What sector are you in if you do nt mind me asking that is .
- - Most of those games we had demar but its still interesting 
  - you see that s something I would have never known . Thanks for pointing that out .
- - You can put the rupees in the bank though ...
  - But they re not worth missing out completing a sidequest over by trying to make it to the bank rather than helping someone .
- - People believe that  You honestly believe that your movement is being taken seriously  We ll see how things go  then .
  - Go back to your little hug box  I hear they re about to protest how shadows are sexist because they re bigger for men than women .
- - Gah  your jeans look so dang good . Great pics  looks like fun 
  - Thank you brother  it was loads of fun .

  - yes  that is a good option as well . If Blizz is set on transmog  another commenter suggested adding Darkmoon Faire transmogs to the list .
- - You guys were never the most hated team . Everyone is just angry at the bullshit call .
  - Haha we kinda are . We have been lit up all year
- - Princess Cookie . Granted  he s just the princess to the other mental patients ...

- - Double team beak attack on Gromit s eyeballs . That would suck .
  - I do nt think two chickens have a chance are reaching his eyes  let alone being able to peck them .
- - Because the water levels are screwed up on some maps and the terrain fixes that were talked about never happened and were shelved . Enjoy the make believe terraforming

  - ZombieGrub has more fangirls then you have had girlfriends ...
- - Please share your sources  which I m sure are rock-solid .

- - For what it s worth  I can see exactly what you mean .
  - Thank you . Was getting a bit frustrated here .
