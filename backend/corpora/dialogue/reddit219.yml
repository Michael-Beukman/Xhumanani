- - It is a vulnerability in a Microsoft product . No one is to blame out side of Microsoft for anything that happens from public awareness of said vulnerability .
  - By this logic  are you okay that google wo nt allow customers to conduct third party vulnerability tests on their platform you are putting data on 
- - That sucks . In my experience companies always try to squirm out of warranty  but if they claim it s a waterproof electronic  it had better be waterproof

  - Nah  that looks like a typical upper middle class home in the Middle East .
- - It s been a while since we had a good prospect at this tournament
  - Hey  Demko played pretty well for the US .

  - I d imagine they d benefit greatly from printing more of them complete collections of the AP s  similar to RotRL
- - Bulldog is one of the few people who understand how to get viewers and people to love you .
  - Hes just being himself  you fool . There s no craft in it ...
- - I do nt think you need to read between the lines to know that Pete s system could nt do shit on the breakout .

  - Probably so people do nt mistakenly take them when they walk away .
- - Playing devils advocate maybe his wording was poor and he meant she attacked him first 
  - There is no scenario where beheading is self defense .
- - you managed to get a picture between the rain and snow 
  - Snow  In Seattle  You must be trippin  .
- - His sexual relations with a subordinate caused this situation .
  - Her reporting it also caused the situation .
  - Was it wrong of Snowden to leak because it may have lost some people their jobs

  - Nope  he s male . Agree d that the angle is weird though .
- - I would have thrown them off the balcony .
  - Whoa  watch out for this guy .
- - New bot . Talk about cats and you get cat facts . Kentucky  Arizona  and Villanova threads will become quite informative .
  - I see that bot getting banned in the very near future .

  - Either way to me it gives me a new way of thinking about Kevin .
- - There are online races with cops involved  
  - Yup  wanted levels were on  and this race cuts through the military base .
- - Wait . He has a wikipedia page 
  - Right  Like who cared enough to make that .
- - I believe it when people in white coats make these claims . I disbelieve it when people in white robes make these claims .
  - Basically the origins of the Intelligent Design movement and the Discovery Institute .
- - Do you realize you re trying to sell me your religion 
  - What do I believe besides that Joshu had a tree 
- - Pumbaa s about to have a very bad day .
  - Agreed . The lower part of his body will never work again .

  - YOU WATCH YOUR MOUTH  THOSE ARE AMAZING JERSEYS
- - All ... Some are worse than others though . I ca nt handle the gills  they freak me out
  - It s the texture that turns me off .
- - The tipping point . It s so bizarre to see it in a country like France ... but holy geez . Prayers are with you France 
  - And they ve said repeatedly on the news that they have too many suspected extremists to keep track of them all . This could continue happening over and over .
- - this is why i dont understand hey lets get wasted parties the night before
  - I tried to stop her  but she insisted she could handle it . And I mean I literally took shots away from her .
- - this ended up being really great . thank you .

  - Right   Now you can coordinate studs to everything 
- - Lol I meant it as a joke since it was totally off topic but ok
  - Hahaha . Thats fine . Besides  i think thats off the rules
- - Chip does nt evaluate tape on somebody when he does nt know what is being asked of them . Why should we 
  - He probably was nt being asked to throw interceptions haha

  - Cuz I asked if you were mad  lol
- - I got sick of all the Korrasami posts .
  - They are going down rapidly TBH . It s not too bad . It s tolerable .
- - So you mean Jones was high as shit fighting DC  You mean J.J. was numb when fighting D.C.

  - Sure  I probably wo nt have time until Monday or Tuesday .
- - Kudos for not lying about the injury . D Grats on the job btw . What will you be doing

- - If the keyboard is sending the wrong codes there s nothing you can do .
  - Well it works on Windows  so I do nt understand how the operating system would change what codes were sent .
- - There is literally no reason why I would want Magma Rager over Spider Tank . Some cards can be better than others  no need to be a card commie .

- - Can we get this asshole fired  Or push him to kill himself for our amusement 
  - Do nt like what he says  then choose not to listen .

  - Just check out the youtube channel that uploaded the video .
- - What a guy  it d be nice if he became president one day
  - I do nt know about that  but it would at least be nice if he could be the first lady .
- - Is that icon a default of some sort  I swear I just removed that account from my neighbors list .
  - I think it s one of a few default images that you can choose from when setting your avatar . It looks like a character from The Sims .
- - Maybe pigs are nt supposed to fly . Birds still fly better .
  - I guess  but if you do nt want something to fly  then it does nt matter .
- - ART or Dalvik  I had to switch back to Dalvik and it sped up a bit  especially when using Sense apps  Google Drive apps  and the camera
  - I m using ART  thanks for the suggestion

- - Is it electronic music  Can you dance to it 
  - Yanno I did ask myself this before I posted it lol
- - Should nt Greenpeace react  I m pretty much sure that keeping whales as pets is against the law .
  - If you love something  let it free .
- - But you did nt say he could nt .
  - I mean I guess it s fine if he does ... The moment he sneezes though it s going to look like Andy Dick celebrating a cold .
- - i m willing to bet you ve never been the victim of rape 
  - Meaning I ca nt understand the situation presumably

- - Ca nt capture anything till I save more money  but I d be willing to do a podcast type thing . I have a pretty good mic
  - That s cool . Will you message me on RT site or twitter . Everything can be discussed further
- - This is good  but why is it a mythic  Its definitely bomby  maybe not as good as figure of destiny  but I m not seeing mythic .
  - Probably because it looks insane if you drop it on curve in limited . Also money . Wizards loves making bomby mythics because they sell packs .
- - The Parisian train system is also filthy  especially the RER .
  - That s true but regional trains are for the most part extremely well maintained .
- - Regardless to where ever they move i will always love the rams
  - Regardless to wherever they move I will become totally indifferent to the Rams .
- - hi there  cud u hatch my egg plz 
  - Sure . Added you . Add me back and let me know when you will be online .
- - What s the requirement to be a porn star
  - Competition is getting tough nowadays so having two dicks would give you an advantage

  - I just got back from Home Depot . SO MANY TOYS .
- - I hate myself for laughing at this .
  - I just threw my fleshlight across the room .
- - We have the worst winning percentage all time of any team . I would definitely call this season a success overall .
  - Its because we lose so much that this season stings so bad . We make the playoffs so rarely that this trip didnt even feel like a trip at all .
