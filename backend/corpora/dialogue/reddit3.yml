  - I hope to get him as well  You are an awesome dad 
- - So who s the telescope pointed at 
  - Navy Pier ... and sometimes the building near it .
- - Looks like a beefy enough gaming laptop so I do nt see the issue .
  - I m not really complaining its just a bit of a different setup than my usual
- - I do nt know how to feel about this . Like  I m kind of happy - but I m also not .
  - He did nt even mention the nipple slip that will have had happened during the game . I do nt think he is legit .
- - This should be highlighted at the launcher of the game
  - As cool as that would be we should leave the launcher for official things
- - I now have you tagged as sad guy . Edit . Now tagged as pissed guy .
  - Less sad  more pissed . But hey  thanks .
- - fair enough  I was wrong . You were right . Therefore my argument is invalid .
  - Are you being genuine  I m not sure .
- - You are nt allowed to criticise him  only moral masturbation is allowed .
  - Liking someone for being a nice guy is moral masturbation 
- - What is it that makes you think you re not a good person 
  - I do nt really know . I just hate myself .
- - Im really having a hard time recognizing this as a peaceful religion .
  - Do nt worry you should never make such a mistake .
- - tl ; dr absolutely nothing was said here
  - I disagree . OP outlined his main points well and decently argued each with examples . Whether or not the content is interesting is completely subjective .
- - I m killing off Jacob on purpose too  he annoys me .
  - I always to the same  really do nt like him .
- - That may be it . But no cure  so still where I am . Cest la vie .
  - Does nt it say there that eating differently helps a lot  Maybe you should try that 
- - Quite disturbing how a group of adults are taking pictures of a naked child
  - It s a statue that s come to life though ...
- - My grandma has a cottage with nice wooden sauna there  when I was a kid I used to run naked around the cottage few times after sauna .
  - I think this is the correct answer .
- - Wow thank you so much  what a sweet surprise 
  - I just read it . Some powerful stuff . Keep doing what you re doing .
- - Those three NPCs are actually the multiplayer characters .
  - I assume they can be edited  since they change genders and races frequently  Did nt touch multiplayer yet  that s why i m asking .
- - cause of steamworks  GFWL version runs fine
  - Yep . Never understood why people complained so much . GFWL s authentication was bad  but after I got past that  I actually did nt mind it .
- - Just a side note  Denial looks insanely good this tournament .
  - They lost to sYn  they ca nt be THAT good
- - And one pit . Poor grey pit ...
  - The old  grey Pit  he ai nt what he used to be .
- - The entire country  Every single point  Because that d take a looooong time  and by then the situation would be over .
  - It s hard to miss activity on this scale  and a single recon plane can cover a lot of ground . Multiple flights means that yeah  we d notice .
- - Using Firefox with ad blocking and privacy addons . The addons feature really stops me from using anything else .
  - Yeah I also use Firefox for this reason  plus it also syncs my bookmarks from my desktop .
- - What were you expecting  Downton Abbey does Birdseye 
  - Not snatching with fingers would be nice 
- - Is this different than pulling up the bottom menu and just turning the brightness down 
  - It makes it a bit darker than lowest brightness
- - It is concealed racism . The top comment is complaining that they are nt pure Germans and do nt speak proper German
  - Thank God we have people like you here to be the arbiter of people s hidden motivations and to judge a country based on internet comments .
- - no exposed skin  take it slow  maintain your bike  be as visible as possible
  - Absolutely  Anything exposed these days is just asking for frostbite 
- - Dude  freaking wow  I just want to fucking play a game with my fucking shirt off . Holy shit  it gets better  when his mom starts yelling .
  - Wait  his mom starts yelling     Better turn the video on and skip ahead 
- - He didnt make that much  alot of them were unsub resub .
  - are you retarded  unsub resub requires money still
- - Who the fuck was in charge of designing a opera house with shit acoustics 
  - It s as a result of those in public office controlling the purse strings  and pissing off the architect .
- - The fact that she has a name plate
  - The fact that she s more over than Carmella
- - Hallowed Knight stole my Thrall kill when trying to do this bounty . Makes you wonder why dropped enemy grenades do nt blow their buddies to bits .
  - Yeah I have not seen this happen with other enemies either  I guess the Hive hate each other .
- - What if we start putting solar panels in houses  Is nt it a better alternative 
  - It would be  if there were no such things as clouds or night .
- - Dude  get out of there asap . You can find a new place to play video games  but dignity is a bit harder to come by .
  - Meh  dignity can be faked  but saving money on rent is real
- - How does it feel to be above zero 
  - Not thaaat bad  but I forgot gloves so I could nt feel my hands for a while haha
- - Schefter and Marrone have the same agent FYI .
  - Ik that ... makes it even more likely that this actually happened .
- - This is nt exactly what you were focused on  but contouring the nose would help .
  - Oh you are telling me  My nose is my least favorite feature . I m trying to find a good contour brush and shade . Need more monies 
- - Congrats  I m starting on Tuesday  Hooray for new jobs 
  - Hooray  And congrats to you as well 
- - Get the fuck over it already you old fucking bastards .
  - Do you believe that only old people support a constitutional separation of powers 
- - Just a warning for people  you ca nt sell them back so you are stuck with them .
  - This is true but can store them when your done . They also earn a decent amount of coins for those who need them .
- - The flow doesnt feel right . Always rushing  illogical decisions .
  - Game looks strange to me as well .
- - There certainly are a few race conscious people in this sub ...
  - no  there are only a few twits and mostly shills trying to perpetuate a stereotype .
- - I m rooting for Not Dallas . Just like every time .
  - That s my favorite team . Mostly because I m a Chiefs fan . I l like my team to win every now and then ya know 
- - Earth Spirit s Stone Remnant and Timbersaw s Chakrams .
  - Actually all of es abilities even tho I wish I would put the roll on normal cast .
- - i m indian . i believe indian army does have some indigenous missiles and arms in its arsenal
  - I said  most not all . Because the same applies to China aswell . In any case missile technology is barely shared among countries .
- - Blame Wizards of the Coast for making it hard to hit unmoving targets .
  - As far as I m aware inanimate unmoving targets in most tabletop games are automatic hits .
- - I ve been having the same problem too with my key
  - Yep  it will usually save from whatever you last had . Not always  oddly enough .
- - Hey look mom  I m relevant 
  - Yay for being on a list . But for all the wrong reasons .
- - How the fuck is that image NSFW 
  - it s a guy about to be murdered .
- - You do nt really need to watch the recap episodes at all .
  - Alright  thank you . I wonder why they re included on MyAnimeList though they usually do nt do that .
- - The girl on the left s knees look like human faces .
  - Yeah  knees are kind of weird looking when you think about it .
- - Does he half an ear or is the angle of that he s sitting
  - It looks like he had a severe case of ear mites at some point .
- - at least he s honest ... i guess
  - Is it really honesty or is he having a simple chemical reaction during a certain event  Beep boop .
- - Yeah that s true . There has never been any issues with officiating . Especially at international level .
  - At least in this case one of the referees officiating the game is a respected veteran of six World Championships and two Olympic games .
- - But it does nt mean that discussing genocides is completely off-limits  right 
  - Nope just the comparison of them for the purposes of ranking .
- - From which web site does what come  Everything here is from my own study .
  - Yes . But from the format its apparent that you copied and pasted that chart from a website .
- - Maybe try Etsy  I know a girl who bought a triforce necklace on there . Actually looks pretty nice .
  - Can totally second Etsy . As with ebay  check the feedback score of a seller before you commit .
- - You bought a Space Gray iPhone if you wanted them to match  why would nt you have a silver phone 
  - I m not the op but I assume because the silver iPhone is also white .
- - I really do nt think Jovetic is all that special to be honest . Pretty wasteful in possession but has a few moments of brilliance .
  - Has been played as a loan striker . He is better playing behind one . He needs someone ahead of him to play the ball to .
- - I wish I was seeing the whole field so I could tell whether the receivers ca nt get open or Driskell is just too scared to pull the trigger .
  - It s been receivers before  could certainly be the case here .
- - He s not a piece of shit  he has schizophrenia .
  - Like calling someone with cancer one . Illness is illness .
  - Someone with cancer can be a piece of shit . A schizophrenic does nt have control over their mind and their actions are a result of that .
  - I should have elaborated  I mea nt calling them one for being bald or weak . Completely out of their control .
- - Against a team we have beaten twice already
  - That s just the regular season though .
- - I might have to tackle this one xD
  - I ll look forward to seeing what you come up with . Nervously .
- - Seems like a big hassle  maybe you should just sell the wheels .
  - Kinda what I m leaning toward at the moment . I ll probably keep the front and build a new back wheel .
- - Do you have any left you would trade me through GTS 
  - Sure  Should I just post it onto GTS then 
- - A puppy . Just try it you heartless bastards .
  - Train the puppy for a while to become deadly violent whenever a trigger word is spoken . Give it to a person you want dead .
  - But by that time it will most likely no longer be a puppy . It will be a dog  and there is a difference .
  - In that case  infect your enemy s puppy with rabies
- - But I do nt get why is OP wearing their bosses  clothes  I never wear my bosses  clothes .
  - OP is dressing for the job he wants
- - Does anyone have a link to actual archeological remains of one of these automatic temple door mechanisms  or were they only designs on paper 
  - Good question  it was nt clear in the video .
- - Suburbs outside Portland . And plenty of other places around the PNW .
  - I used to live in Eugene and I do nt know what you re talking about .
- - Where is this  You can do this at Beaver Creek in Saskatchewan  Canada .
  - You can do this anywhere . Just feed the birds and get them used to human presence . Source . pike lake  they do it here too .
- - Is there any way to track how many you have opened 
  - Just mouse over one  It ll tell you how many you have opened .
- - If you can tell us where to buy these sweaters I would be soooo happy . . D
  - I wish I could tell you it was from some super fancy place but ... we get all of her sweaters from Walmart 
- - God damn . I wish I had enough time to do this one today . I feel like this is the last major spy I have nt had fight Archer yet .
  - Do nt worry  we ll repost it again . In time ...
- - To me is that the people s happiness does nt really matter as long as you have the factions  support and an army to kill the rebels .
  - To me its easier to keep people happy than to have the support of every faction .
- - Oh  these witty chalk signs  What will those rascals come up with next  
  - When the next creative commercial comes out .
- - Nope . No CEL at all . I will look into the coil aswell .
  - Could be idle air valve  maybe maf need cleaned . Does it stall with defroster running 
- - How did it go  Fill us in 
  - I think ari said he would make a post about it soon
- - I think you may have left out some nuance in your biased headline .
  - Where did that head line come from  Nowhere in the linked article did it mention the NRA s response .
- - That s like saying nothing is cheese since every type of cheese tastes different .
  - That just blew my mind . WHAT ABOUT THE MOON      
- - Are the dividers slightly bendy or solid and rigid  I ca nt tell from the pictures .
  - They re rubber  so they re flexible .
- - I was the sales person . I do nt think I ever saw her again . I put my ring back as soon as she walked out .
  - Oh whoops  read that wrong  Alright I guess I ll put my righteous anger away ... she still sucks
- - High five for lack of pants  Your eye skills are wonderful . I have nt bought Shiro in a while but I kinda really want Aurora Borealis now .
  - Cara  I can depot some for you  Just remind me on the weekend  . D
- - Goal and an assist for McDavid  Should he go for the Gordie Howe Hat trick 
  - Yeah worked out real well last time 
- - Wynwood is one of my favorite places 
  - Yea it s simply amazing how much it s turned around over the last few years  I love it .
- - Where do I go from here  I m super lost ack
  - Are you here     If so give me a call 
- - Steve Bernier is actively in opposition to being liked by fans of the team he plays for .
  - I still like Bernier . I believe in Steve .
- - I do nt even know what this means  but OP is better than me so I m all for it .
  - How sweet of you to recognize your overlord . D
- - maybe the waiter did nt know what blue rare meant 
  - Maybe not  but the chef should have
- - Was he as big as he is now 
  - Nope . He s always been bigger than most but in the past few years he s bulked up a lot .
- - Will do that when I get home . I also was going to try testing it with PHT  it should play directly there right 
  - yep  or xbmc with plex plugin  which is what i use .
- - With respect  that is what your initial comment seemed to have been saying . Otherwise  I would agree with you on what you said here .
  - Go troll somebody else . I m tired of this
- - Do nt get any on your arm  and remember to eat them like you re doing a shot .
  - As an atheist chef  bourbon mash potatoes  Wtf
  - So you deny the existence of mash 
  - I got bubble and squeak on the menu tomorrow .
- - I suggest making an excel spreadsheet for this like the malmo threads . That would make things easier .
  - Good idea . Unfortunately I m traveling today . Anyone out there have a few minutes to spare 
- - I d ask for context  but I suspect it would give me cancer .
  - If you visit gunnit without expecting cancer  you re gon na have a bad time .
- - They could also be making a game that spans generations  since CODs have already covered so much ground .
  - That s what I m thinking . Maybe time traveling 
- - I do nt know about the rest of ya ll but I prefer this format over the ug . I m in .
  - yeah i m getting used to it ... it helps me greatly by sorting the comments by newest .
- - I always get a kick out of people that get blown away from learning that narwhals are real animals .
  - what about when they discover that it bacons at midnight
- - I do nt know about skyrocketing  but he will go up in price
  - Okey  thanks . That s what I wanted to hear .
- - What s the mata with our corner ability ...
  - the wind  its stoke  its mental there

  - Perhaps announcing details tomorrow on BLAM happening next week 
- - You might need to relog to get your account status updated properly client side .
  - Yup that s all it is . I had the same issue when I upgraded .
- - Apple bout to drop the hottest mixtape of all time
  - I been Tim Cook with the stock boi
- - Why would other kinds of punishment not exhibit a similar threshold 
  - Seems to work for the majority of the prison population
- - just popping in to say I am in agreement . Muslims need to be expelled from Europe . There is no question .
  - Thank you Brother  God wills it .
- - Does anyone have a good stream  NBC doesnt air the game ...
  - Go to NBCSports.com and stream it there . Or just head to Brewhouse ...
  - We have a business thing from Comcast  so the online thing doesnt work .
  - Which is interesting as Comcast owns NBC ...
- - Dray is good but he s not even the best defender on the Warriors . Gasol or Butler would be my choices
  - Idk . It seems like Butler plays worse defense than last year . He woul basically get the award for increased offensive output .
- - Is that Kane and Mankind s love child 
  - no it s abyss . he s been in tna for like ten years .
- - What re you saying  find a seat  Was nt it assigned 
  - Floor seating was nt set . General seating was first come  first served Suites were sit wherever you want .
- - Rivers was actually picked by the Giants and Eli the chargers .
  - Well I mean they are all on the same team as they were by the end of the night .
- - Next time they call ask them where to send the check .
  - I asked for a physical address to send a check via certified mail and the refused to give me one .
- - Yum  Wish I was underneath . D
  - I ll save you some for next time .
- - Probably because it was trending so recently . Give it like a month and things should go back to normal .
  - God I hope so  it s starting to get to the all time top .
- - imho you appear totally female in these photo s . in fact you look almost exactly like my old biology tutor and she very def a woman 
  - thanks ive always wanted to seem like a smart teacher
- - I would recommend taking supports that can hold their own mid lane  Morgana and Annie do fine in the mid-lane .
  - Ill definitely try annie  Im no good with Morg tho hahaha ... rather I just havent picked her up  Maybe Ill giver her a shot 
- - Dresden Dolls forever  I highly recommend them to everyone .
  - Me too  When you get past the angst driven lyrics  it s a fantastic experience . Amanda Palmer is brilliant .
- - Same  Even tho I would prefer if it was Stanford
  - My mans  My cousin of their strength and conditioning coach so naturally they are my team
- - How do you get motivation to do this  I absolutely hate questing XC
  - Being a fat  lazy neckbeard with no life outside of OSRS helps .
- - Is the odd sway here real  Almost everyone says bet on Volgare but the percentage for them keeps on decreasing
  - wait until it gets closer to the match  the odds will probably change ...
- - Where did you hear about it  Rank can have different meanings .
  - Well it s in my course on Quadratic Form and bilinear algebra ...
- - They do not have access to the rare drop table .
  - yes they do  i have gotten a key half before
- - This . Find other ways to deal with your oral fixation if you need to so badly . Like sucking cocks .
  - D E E P T H R O A T B O Y S
- - I believe a utopia is an ideal  but almost certainly an unattainable one . I m not yet certain if that should stop us from trying to attain it
  - Well if we try and fail the worst that could happen is neutral and hopefully we d get positive
- - heya  add me . i ve got one you can have .
  - Just GTS it to me  put up a random pokemon asking a machamp .
- - Literary criticism and theory is a lot like kung fu . we study it and practice it so that we may never have to use it .
  - Dude  you just left a roadside tea house filled with corpses in your wake ...
- - Maybe she s got her other leg up on something behind the bride and groom 
  - Nah  it s behind the other one . If you zoom you can just make part of it out on the right side of the one you can see .
- - Katara II looks hot why does Rai remind me of Hans 
  - The structure of his face does look a fair bit like Hans . Glad the artist did NOT give him sideburns though .
- - No  he meant he rented an RV and drove them there . That s true leadership
  - Not like Cam  who wears a towel on his head .
- - Next time do nt deposit something REAALLY VALUABLE .
  - No worries . I have a powersave device and it was a clone .
- - Stop hogging all the recruits Texas  please and thank you .
  - If Mack offered a scholarship to JT Barrett instead of Tyrone Swoopes  you d see JT in burnt orange .
- - Why do you suppose the rear camera does nt pick it up 
  - It does have the IR filter  thus it blocks that part of the spectrum . The front camera does not have the IR filter  so it detects the light .
- - Grenades too strong  I completely disagree ; with the introduction of thruster packs  grenades are pretty weak . They re super easy to avoid . Just thruster pack away .
  - The radius so huge even with thruster you ll still get hit
- - Sorry  Seems you caught me right after I fell asleep . I should be free to go online anytime today if you re not busy c .
  - That s cool . You still around 
- - I really want to tie a balloon to my cat now . For science .
  - Since we re talking about tying stuff to cats  if you tie a tube sock around their waist they lose all sense of balance .
- - It was very obvious this was coming . Has Alberta been saving up to weather storms like this 
  - Yes  we have the Heritage Fund  and also we have a relatively low amount of debt so running a deficit for a while is nt a major problem .
- - I bet he s the one with the most money in his pocket . Poor engineer my arse 
  - How can you know without knowing what everyone else in the photo does 
- - If he is showing interest and does nt want to wear undies  why not let him just go naked 
  - He insists on wearing a diaper . I think it s because we have a newborn . He wants to be babied .
- - Love the video idea  hadnt thought to try that . Been just reading articles . Also  where can I get washes  my LGS doesnt carry them
  - Online orders  you can use either the official gw website or order through local businesses
- - I really like your style  nice .
  - Thanks  It s a new one I ve only recently been trying out .
- - Got drunk in my living room  made a pillow fort and watched starwars . N got laid .
  - that is pretty awesome  If my bf didnt have to leave  we probably would have had a similar time lol 
- - I m sure she ll succeed where everyone else has failed
  - Well you know what is guaranteed to not succeed  That attitude .
- - At first I thought that was a hipster dad  then I saw OP s name and realized he s just Canadian .
  - Canadian hipster  We just call them hipsters here .
- - Show me someone that handles IT for Apple products . I ll show you someone who hates Steve Jobs .
  - I imagine the Foxconn workers that get fished out of the suicide nets in China do nt care for him much either .
- - Not really feeling the tee sticking out . Shoes are mad out of place too .
  - Agreed  grey tee kills the fit and looks really out of place . The shoes look fine  though .
- - Nice town  I also have to comment on how awesome the shaders were  . D
  - thanks  haha  are nt they just amazing  Love the Seus shaders . P

  - Having worked in the service industry previously  I always tip well 
- - Oh great  You get all the size  weight  and NFA regulation of a short barreled carbine with none of the benefits 
  - I am dumb . why would the stupid plastic attachment make it an NFA item 
- - My SO brushes his teeth dry . It makes me gag when I notice it .
  - How can you stay with that person 
  - I ve been committing this crime against humanity all these years and no one thought to tell me  
  - well  no  but you re seriously damaging your teeth s enamel by going in dry .
- - This is probably what s going to happen . Most people have other crap to worry about besides the pizza girl s fiance . Anyway  thanks for your comment .
  - I think it would make a difference if you were waitressing  but delivery  Not so much mostly because the exchange is so rapid .
- - Probably just training for the fire department .
  - That s possible . There are some fire departments fairly close to there
- - generally you just want your early game stuff . Always keep deathlord . Against aggro you want frostbolt deathlord and sheep .
  - I have nt played the deck enough to see how the situation pans out  but is nt keeping deathlord against warrior a bit hopeful 
- - Nope . She identifies as a woman .
  - Not as far as I m concerned .
- - Yup  he d just have an even cooler scar for the story .
  - Hey  if you think bullet wounds are cool ... I have an idea for you ...
- - So you want the the ability to live life on someone else s dime .
  - Nope . I want the ability to bargain for my wage an hours .
- - Poom poom is nt a real word  is it  I mean you just made that up  you must have .
  - Jamaicans say poom poom . I believe it is patois .
  - Not just Jamaicans  the whole Caribbean says it .
  - Understandable  however when it comes to Caribbean s  I have only been around Jamaicans .
- - It does nt look like dynasty warriors to me
  - Yeah but it s still a hack and slash game .
- - I m sorry but the refs have been ass tonight
  - Definitely  there have been obvious missed calls on both sides
- - I think my favorite is Littlefinger as the sleazy  slick wall street type .
  - Yeah  they remind me of GTA covers . I really like Joffrey .
- - It does nt matter if he s pro pc  false claims are false claims and he should nt get a free pass just cause he makes funny zero punctuation videos .
  -  That was his opinion . He said he did nt mind it and never claimed one was objectively better than the other .
- - Did u make that with the william sonoma pumpkin cake mold 
  - No  just with a normal bundt pan 
- - FUCK THE BUCKS Said no one ever .
  - Shame  really . It s so catchy .
- - dude she was trying to get with you man
  - Was thinking so . I attract a fair amount of Black women .
- - I can easily find a game online for any version I want to play . Is your NAT type set up right  Have you tried online recently 
  - Yes and yes . The game works for some and for some it do nt .
- - shower room  You have a shower at work 
  - A lot of places do . Not uncommon at all . Many offices have a gym and a set of showers for use by employees .
- - I wonder how high you could get on an ion engine with big enough wings  Might have to try this tonight .
  - The problem with ion planes is you sort of have to break out the physics-less parts to make it .
- - music  just muted  pick farmer  farm  rat  win .
  - I usually play music  but ratting is way too boring  I prefer picking fighting carries and running in to slap some faces .
- - Just tested it  yeah it does . Thanks for the tip .
  - Thanks for confirming my theory . Do nt know why I did nt test it myself honestly .
- - Nightfall and raids . In the case of the Obsidian Mind  only CE would have a chance of dropping it .
  - The raid can only drop exotic weapons  not armor
- - Of the anal  before  during and after her taking you in . If you do nt mind that is lol
  - Gon na have to do a new shoot boys lol
- - This is cool  if I ever get into flashing or whatever I ll put this on to look at for parties .
  - Great idea  if you got sd card reader for the snes you could have a collection .
- - and watch qtpie s stream . your skill and wisdom will skyrocket in days
  - and if you sub  so will your dick
- - The ability to climb pretty much anything . Ca nt apes do that 
  - Go with monkey and have a working tail too . Could you imagine that . Hold your own beer while you do something dangerous .
- - I think it was just a funny song to use for the scary story gag and it just rolled from there .
  - Also because they ran out of money for music so they just reused the song a lot that season .
- - Oldham took Lee Hughes  I dont think they can claim the moral high ground
  - They re not claiming the moral high ground - they re trying to sign him .
- - I like the older editions because of the art and feel  and because there is sooo much material available on the internet and in print .
  - Oh  I totally get that . I tend too take material from older editions of games and translate them over too the new ones .
- - One of the more underrated players in the game
  - Seriously . I loved him in his Magic days . Consistent from three and got a lot of rebounds for us .
  - I m still mad we gave him to the Magic for nothing .
  - I remember at the time  people were saying he was just a throw in . Turned out to be the best part of the deal .
- - I m not sure but I will try 
  - I swear I m in an anime right now ...
- - Remender has made me loose interest in all his books but this one so quick . It s like all art and no substance for the most part .
  - I think that Low has been absolutely fantastic so far  personally .
- - Does it bug anyone else that the color of the endzone does not reach the perimeter  Why would they do that .
  - Same thing with Tennessee s checkerboard . It bothers me so much
- - Jay has actually been a dog all his life but secretly wished he was a cat .
  - If you watch his Twitter stream tonight  you might think differently .
- - Great start  You have a beautiful voice and it sounds like you really had some fun 
  - Thank you  I really did . Although i am having trouble on what to do next . Any ideas or suggestions 
- - Is that a younger jughead and archie  Was there an era in human history where wearing cloth crowns was a thing 
  - It was the style at the time .
- - I d want this just so he and his long lost twin brother Chris Jericho can finally be reunited .
  - With special musical guest  Bon Jovi 
- - this is probably where the trade-up contract comes in
  - not worth it still  unless it is for a dragon lore but it is really hard to make money on that .
  - he would nt do it if it was not worth it . stop speculating if you have nt tried this
  - I was talking about trade up contracts but okay  sorry if i offended you .
- - Holy shit you are fucking hot  The stockings are amazing 
  - Thank you  Actually Im slightly chilly as its a bit cold tonight  but I got ta agree those are my favorite stockings 
- - thanks for the heads up  Does that include Yosemite as well 
  - I think he meant to stay away from Yosemite .
- - Apple uses Chinese Sweat Shop labor . I am surprised that most Macs even turn on  let alone run like they do .

  - That s actually a very good point . Thanks for that

  - Wow  that kinda sucks . But laws are different for reasons u suppose n
