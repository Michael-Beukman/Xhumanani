  - A fair point  my friend . Great books too .
- - Home Alone ... Parents could just facebook or skype or call Kevin s cell phone .
  - If the long distance lines are down why could nt internet and cell towers be down 
  - That would change the genre to post-apocalyptic . I would totally watch a post-apocalyptic Home Alone .
  - Or it could be the result of a really bad snow storm
- - You d like a lot of metal songs 
  - No . Metal is my least favorite genre next to country .
- - I made one that had a handsome face . But as soon as I saw the skinny body it looked ridiculous . Really  someone ought to make elfs bulkier .
  - Tiny body  huge head . Really bad with a greatsword
- - That depends on the coffee shop . There are definitely some that pretty much only have local clientele .
  - Which ones  I am going there next week and I hate tourists . I like to find the locals .
- - You can do it at the specialty kiosks as well . If you have one of those anywhere near you .
  - Is there a way to search these separate from the stores 
- - Was there really any chance they were nt going to be Muslim 
  - Could ve been a nutjob like Timothy McVeigh or Anders Brevik
- - Yes  it s the Laser Autofocus . But why would you want to disable it 
  - Hard to secretly record if the laser light gives it away .
- - Let s be honest  Su is the real babe here . Talk about a MILF . I hate the word bae so I m sticking to babe
  - I m gay and I d bang her
- - Looks like CEX  not Gamestop . Am I missing something here 
  - It is CEX but I thought GameStop would be more recognizable .
- - Americans wo nt get it  for two reasons .
  - I m American  and I got it .

- - Very pretty  Is the purple loose glitter 
  - Actually it s Orly s Bubbly Bombshell  I like to layer it over the hot pink color .
- - It certainly was nt a bad performance  just excellent midfield from Valencia and a tired Kroos .
  - Kroos is nt gon na get any less tired when we play atleti
- - Templar is cheesed by making him leave the map . Crota is cheesed by a guardian leaving the map .
  - Templar had a secretary named Crota . Crota had a secretary named Templar . It s a conspiracy .
  - And both will be PUG s nightmare when fixed
  - Cmon now  Crota is nt that bad .
- - I ve heard it can make things worse .
  - You ve  heard  it must not have been loud enough  lol
- - It s like Bersin wants to be executed in downtown Charlotte . Just call a fair catch  dude .
  - Seriously . This guy is making me cringe .
- - I think the better player to sign would be Dragic this summer over Rondo and probably cheaper too
  - Doubt it . I think Phoenix would match just about any offer . He is a better fit though  that I agree with .
- - Few things are more annoying than the constant association of Los Angeles with Hollywood .
  - Especially since LA is known for coke and transients .

  - I remember there being a few actually  Ill check when I get home if I saved any .
- - It s the unstoppable force on the road vs the immovable object at home . This is going to be an exciting game
  - Weird  it s almost like the NFL wanted this narrative .
- - Just a note  valve has come out and said they ll take care of people s libraries if steam goes under .
  - Yeah  I ve always heard that  but have never seen an official statement about it . Would nt happen to have a source would you 
- - Just tell her that black does nt crack .
  - That does nt seem very serious ... but good advice 
- - Sandwich  whatever it is  I wan na put it in my face .
  - enjoy the pic cause it looks very different when you order it whatever it is .
- - So in reality it s another vague policy suggestion about something we pretty much already do  Pretty surprising coming from UKIP ...

  - Oh  poor thing  I hope he heals quickly 
- - Coming from a guy like me who loves Skyrim and thought DA . I was ok  do you think I would enjoy Origins more 
  - No  DAI is much closer to Skyrim than Origins
- - I think it was clear they were referring to neckbeards who do nothing but waste away in their mother s basements trolling people online .
  - Yes for sure  I m playing devil s advocate .
- - a man with two functioning penises could not write an autobiography because he would not have a free hand
  - He commented above  in this thread .
- - Also Harrison Ford  He s really sexy
  - Young Harrison Ford  Like Indiana Jones time  Hell yah . Older  Not so much .
- - I like how you kept it as James Flacco . Rodgers is nt human .
  - I originally put Joe ... but  nah  liked James better  haha . Thanks for that laugh .
- - Jesus Klingberg is so good . He looks and plays like a veteran .
  - He has so much poise . Cold as ice . When he has the puck  it calms me down . How does that happen while watching a rookie 
- - Arin  I m sorry to break it to you but the Wendy s add was the least of the problems with that episode  lol .
  - at least he was open about that haha
- - A society in which many have no jobs will be wrought with issues . People will still have aspirations but they will be rendered unobtainable .
  - how will they be unobtainable  if every menial task is automated  we can  as a society  focus on art  science and space exploration .
- - The comment section is dark and full of terrors .
  - You went there  Here  take a hug .
- - conundrum is  a bicycle is more a pedestrian than a car  and more a car than a pedestrian . idiots ca nt seem to wrap their heads around this .
  - Because it makes no sense . A bicycle is a vehicle on the road .

  - And crossplay is what killed that game . Keyboard and mouse too strong .
  - I played on Xbox and still had a ton of fun .
  - Yeah the game was fun but once you got into a server with a PC player it was over . Especially if the whole team was on PCs .
- - How do you gift units to civs  .
  - You have to have Open Borders at least and when you are in their territory it is an option .
- - Better gain weight  so they kiss .
  - I think you mean lose weight . Gaining would stretch the image and move them farther apart .
- - I hope you do nt manage anything .
  - Great way to debate and defend your point of argument which you struggled to do so
- - You made it buddy . Good job .
  - I would nt of made it with out you . When I m famous and I win the award for having the most karma I will mention you
- - Oh man  that makes it tough . You do nt have to kill him to stop him .
  - That s not an option given by the above dilemma . It clearly says you can either kill him or allow the holocaust .

  - your logic filter is broken I suppose as the lone gunman represents radical islam and the entirety of the crowd represents the rest of moderate islam
- - Toilet paper . Wait until they re on sale then you should start stocking up .
  - Make sure you get toilet paper you like . Wiping your butt with thin or bad toilet paper sucks .
- - You make it sound so reasonable  when it s so unreasonably stupid
  - Well it is absurd  but DC has quite a few soft sci gi elements in it  so the tech has flexibility in its realism .
- - He s Irish ... and the show is set in London . I guess it s closer to my accent than Moss .
  - What do you mean he s Irish  There are two of them and one of the isnt the Irish one .

- - You look very much like a friend of mine . Just checking .
  - That s such a weird feeling  right 
- - That postman is a cunt ... biting someone s dog
  - Getting one back for team aus post .

  - There will ve poop when you will play anally . I do nt believe anyone can be stupid enough to shame her for that obvious thing .

- - Train  you drunk  go home .
  - but  but ... My plan B was the train ...
- - It s not rational to suggest that the woman who randomly offered to adopt a stranger s child at a Froyo place was doing the right thing .
  - May be I just have a lot of tolerance . Such petty things do nt bother me  if anything it d be entertaining .
- - Nice  I like the idea of forbidden sun for moss eaters . I did use Dark Fog a few times with some success .
  - yeah the mist spells really can do a number .

  - Cause Jesus he knows me  and he knows I m right .

- - That animal is terrified  maybe because they ripped out its teeth so you could have it as a pet .
  - Apparently not this one  although it is common to rip out their teeth .
