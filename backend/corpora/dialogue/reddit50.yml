- - Just think ... Under the BCS  Florida state would be in the national championship instead of Oregon .
  - So glad it happened this year . FSU is way outmatched here .
- - This is a nice idea  but slightly too much work for most to consider this particular solution helpful .
  - Yeah  I just posted it since I had created it for myself anyway . No point of not making it public .
- - I m a noob at hearthstone  but you re so fucking wrong with your invoker statement that it s actually hilarious .
  - Eh  if you ask me Invoker is mostly fine right now appart from how much the spirits got nerfed .

  - If I could make him take Beverley instead of Hill  would it be worth it
