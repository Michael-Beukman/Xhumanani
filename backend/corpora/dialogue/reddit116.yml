  - he is basically an angel  he might of been created with all that .
- - The trial is over . The suspects have been found guilty  and the sentence has been carried out . No need for awkward questions .

  - I havent actually . Sounds like something no psychic type wants to get hit by

  - I want a cat as a pet  would be so much better than a doge
- - What did they do to the Giants  Honestly curious
  - It all starts with Elway for me .
- - Fight On  Wish him well . What he did this year was nothing short of miraculous with so many freshmen  injuries and players out of their positions .

  - Thanks bruh  slides in like a charm
- - Or maybe she did nt do anything and the dad s just abusive .
  - Everything is possible in my vague memory of strangers that I used to tell a joke .
- - Will there be some kind of stream 
  - Unfortunately Basetrade is the only English stream . We can always mute it though 
- - May as well just do it themselves  they would get lighter sentences
  - that screws up the bird to stone ratio .
  - Suck two stones with one bird ... wait that s not the expression is it

  - Was confused by how someone could be this stupid  but then I noticed you re a troll account . Never mind . Carry on 
- - Because shutting of their water would solve anything 
  - it would shut down overnight  forever .
- - So shooting at the exact same spot should penetrate then  . D
  - in reality yes  in game - maybe  depends if it was a low pen roll or not .
- - Should have also included a question about whether you were a fan of the books before the show .

  - They only play but a few catchy songs ... are you remotely surprised that this would occur 
- - Not sure why . Its not like the tines are syringes .

- - I do nt wan na be Oedipus .
  - You ca nt choose who you marry .
- - She actually looks like she s not even mad her son is taking a picture of her whilst she s fucking his roommate

  - sometimes it s okay to be a dick . Source . a dick .
- - You pay more taxes in total in the States than you do in Britain though and you have far less to show for it because most of it goes on war .
  - Everything I just saw after researching says the opposite .
- - So they streamed gunfire live so the hostage taker at the other location can know they moved in . Great work media 
  - I am really hoping there a is delay in the broadcast . Not sure tho
- - Would nt the latency be unbearable between the difference of Cellular and Skype 
  - I thnk it is possible coz we can play videos during call online then there should be a way to connect both call at the time ...
- - Because it shifts the focus away from reducing inefficiencies in the software .
  - That is a developer issue  not really relevant in my opinion . A GOOD developer will take the time to optimize  regardless of the hardware .
- - It get s rid of spawn shadows in-game  Or does it only get rid of them when watching the replay 
  - in game . someone said it might be that causing it  so i disabled it and they came back

  - It s wonderful  really . It s so easy to bring everywhere  and work for all smoking kind of stock .
- - Not surprised by this . She was an English teacher in my high school before politics . Would nt be the first time she prioritized woman over anything else .
  - Would nt this be for the benefit of infants moreso than women  Or are women the only ones who are supposed to care about their children getting proper nutrition 
- - Best of luck to him  I hope he does well .
  - Me too  unless we play them in future CL
- - DLC weapon  So I got to buy DLC for gta online 
  - Luckily all DLC released by Rockstar for GTA Online has been free so far 
- - Thank god for the playoff . FSU is undefeated  so they definitely would have been in  but can you imagine leaving out either Oregon or Bama 
  - we have moved on to a better age
- - Good progress  I d really change the hairstyle though . Would make up for an even better impression imo .
  - Thanks man  Oh yea  What do you think I should go with in regards to my hair

  - I have have most of Wayne s discography right in front of me  but ok ...
- - The intro beat freaked out my cat .
  - Same here  he ran under the couch  decided that was nt good enough and then ran upstairs with a poofy tail .
- - Why the hell are you dressed like a chicken 
  - Why the hell did you take your shoes off 
- - Confirmation bias . You only remember the attractive ones and the attractive ones are the ones who make the news .
  - I think that I d actually remember the unattractive ones a lot more  no  Attractive women are a dime a dozen in the media .
- - Do nt have tested sex with my girl  but i can feel that will be awesome because the erection she gave are adamantium like .

  - Of course . Maybe i ll do him next .
- - Charr mesmer . I ve barely seen two since I started playing .
  - The first character I made was a Charr mesmer because I knew it was going to be unpopular .
- - Looks like he left some treats for you on the floor  Haha
  - Tell that to her ... there s never enough treats 
- - How do you share just the clip  Everyone I save is like twenty min long
  - I edited it in Sharefactory  uploaded it to YouTube and fed it into gfycat
- - Well I think I got some shitty jokes left in me .
  - You should probably get to the bathroom then 
- - Any word on the technical issue that NASA watch was reporting 
  - Nothing yet that I ve seen across any of the social platforms .
- - These are great pics  You ve made me decide that I must take my boy to see the ocean this year .
  - He loved it sooo much that beach is the same one I used to take him to as a pup with my mom

- - This is literally such a mystery to me . I NEED to know what is HAPPENING here 
  - They are siblings and having it on  and its a shock for them to view on tv
