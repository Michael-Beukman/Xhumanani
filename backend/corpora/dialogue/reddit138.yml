  - Yeah I hear you  the range of our melee is pretty awesome .
- - Quick question . Why are the front boats spraying water 
  - Those boats have that to put out fires and such  but when a big event of some sort happens at sea it s tradition to do that .

  - I tried to read the original Stan Lee Iron Man run once ... Not good times .

  - It was like playing a game of conkers with two bowling balls .
- - I d like to see a story staring Gregor . He s the most interesting character with such cool backstory .
  - I d totally buy a bunch of DLC where you play as him doing some weird missions .
- - Why do we call him big dick dray 
  - Is nt it obvious  Because of that large member in between his legs .
- - I seriously doubt they would nt fix this . Call them and ask ...
  - I ll give them a call tomorrow  thanks .

- - Pro tip . do nt be a muslim .
  - Sad realisation . freedom of belief is a farce .
- - Interesting . Thanks for explaining . Now who comes up with these names  Why Bacon and how does this become the universal code name for the device 
  - I believe the device manufacturer comes up with the name . And it s adopted by the Android development community .
- - but it also let things like the holocaust happen
  - The holocaust might not have happened if Hitler had nt disarmed the Jews .
- - Do you know where I can have a discussion with people to have more specific advice 
  - You do nt need specific advice . Gaining weight works the same for everybody .
- - IM so happy right now . He deserves it .
  - why does he deserve it  for showing people how to get to challenger  solid logic .
- - You guys realize that the skills drafted have animations matching your hero s animations in that spell slot . It s a balance change not just a quality of life change .

  - Not just Atlanta unfortunately . At least the kept the Fox Theater .

  - I m not sure to be honest  its from IKEA and was pretty cheap . Sorry I m not much help . x
- - Might as well head north from Bath and give the cotswolds a visit . It s an odd combination though including Bath in that list .
  - I do plan on visiting the north later . Why is Bath an odd combination

  - We are talking but i do nt know if we are more than friends .
- - Does this taste like an authentic Indian restaurant Tikka Masala dish  I have tried several different recipes in the past  I can never get the flavor right .
  - This recipe comes close to restaurant chicken tikka masala . In the future I will leave out the breast meat in favor of thigh meat .
- - Its not about how old BTC is . It s about the number of users versus the potential user base . From this perspective we are still in it s infancy .
  - That is an interesting metric that I have nt seen portrayed before . It really is still quite unique .
- - Fair trade sustainable condoms  I m fucking dying here .
  - They are also reusable  And it comes with a lovely pamphlet with food recipies so the seed of life does not go to waste 
- - No but i would assume craving something that is a whole ocean a way  you would at least bother for it . P
  - Now I am compelled to make them Thank you very much
- - I m abandoning this game to watch Lazar sorry folks .
  - It s ok  no one can tell you re gone as long as Erik keeps his helmet on .
- - What did she say about posting nudes 
  - She posted to a male coworker that if he posted nudes he d get more twitter followers for his stories .
- - ZAZ has nt failed to make me laugh yet .
  - I think it was easily the worst of their movies . But it still had a lot of good moments .

- - Well you ca nt move while dead . The game does nt even allow us to pan the camera . Would be nice if we could at least spectate properly .
  - well by move I meant just moving your camera around with your mouse .
- - Dad made a baby out of clay  mom ate it and pooped out a real baby .
  - I ... I m made of clay 
- - Oh god how does that even happen 
  - from what I can it see looks like girl A  hit girl B with extreme force which caused this to happen .

  - Oh cool  I did nt know that .
- - This is a cute title . . B
  - FUZZY HEYYYY LONG TIME NO SEE where have you been

  - Cruyff and the board are on the worst of terms possible .
- - Solas likes people who ask questions and who make their own decisions rather than mindlessly adhering to dogma .
  - Solas likes people who ask him questions and make the decisions he suggests they make rather than confidently acting like they know what they re doing .

  - you and me both man  you and me both .

- - Holy shit . How d that feel  I imagine it would ... tickle .
  - I almost tapped out but was so close to done i powered through
- - It s a good cautionary tale . The step from trying to censor online comments to demanding the government help out is so small that it s practically microscopic .

  - The problem was he did nt sell it as good as the Lions kicker .
- - Still waiting on a game like this to come on Xbox One .
  - The creators of State of Decay are working on one .
- - It is much more fun to left your opponents alive
  - I would rather right  the opponent instead .
- - So i do not understand the people who because winston is bad  now we have to trade down 
  - Because they do nt like Mariota either

  - Yes  I m not rooted and on Verizon .
- - I miss The Simpsons and Homer Simpson .
  - I m willing to bet OP does nt and has never watched the show and this is just a repost for karma .
- - Danny DeVito and big do not belong in the same sentence .
  - I know  right  It s probably the only time he gets to say it  hence why the character loves to exploit that so much .

- - No point in having Smithers whip it where you ca nt see him 
  - Yup  This morning I didnt realize that Mr Plow earing the key to the city was stationary  so hes currently doing that behind the high school like a weirdo .
- - I m still really impressed by the first one  I m trying to wrap my mind around how exactly his body did that .
  - They did nt believe in physics back then . Come to think of it ... Gymnast s do nt seem to care much for it now either .
- - Its kinda weird . They re making fun of ISIS by saying that they re not Muslim in the least  while simultaneously offending the people they re defending .
  - They re not trying to defend anyone with that statement .
- - The kind that takes half a second before one of them died  like a rock was thrown rather than a bullet shot 
  - Sometimes  also kills behind corners as always .
- - your post was the tipping point for my decision and instantly got me searching on craigslist . beautiful setup you have . enjoy if 
  - It s a well built turntable and it looks great . As soon as I saw it I knew it was for me . Really happy with my choice

  - Does nt make any sense but who am I to argue . lol
- - We d need FTL communication for that .
  - I do nt see why that wo nt be possibly someday . A century ago  things we have today were thought to be impossible but yet here we are .
- - Dude  write a book . I d buy it .
  - I wonder if there s a positive correlation between the tendency to buy those books and upward mobility . I have nt seen it but maybe .
