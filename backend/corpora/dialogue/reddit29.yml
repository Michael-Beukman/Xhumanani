- - Andy Dalton may be mediocre quarterback  but he is probably the least motivational QB in the league . At least some poor QBs like Tebow could inspire his team .
  - And let us not forget that Tim Tebow has won a playoff game .
- - I mostly agree and stuff  but jesus that s a lot of added salt there  man
  - anyone that starts with an intro like that deserves a fair amount of salt . even more so when its followed by garbage

  - It is not automatically granted . It does make it faster and easier  and it does grant you permanent resident status but it does not grant you citizenship .
- - Mask energy signature . Does it Count as cloaking 
  - No  it would nt . That s a bridge officer power .

  - My parents are kinda the other side of the coin ... I was raised by wild hippy english majors ...

  - Did nt get into his hole . This does nt check out .
- - So what you re saying is Kyle Orton retired because of him
  - He seemed to give up halfway through the season .
- - Very average performance and his unwillingness to throw at Sherman at all did him in that game .

- - boy i cant wait not to improve any of our weak points this mercato so that we dont make it farther into the CL  its great being a juve fan

  - Thanks for the response  I guess I will just have to be patient .
- - Cool . I ve been thinking about getting some . Though they seem a bit hard to track down here in Australia .
  - You should be able to order some thru amazon or Mopar s website .
- - You do nt look like a leprechaun  Are the pants corduroy  Maybe the problem is that the looser textured cardigan is competing with the looser textured pants .
  - Close  they re velvet . I think you re right  and I wish the pants went better with the booties .
- - Why did u link it at the ver y end of vid 
  - You re the first person to point that out  I did not mean to do that . Thanks .

  - I read earlier the stila liquid lipsticks are nt as drying

  - There is only Zlatan place  and lesser place .

  - Exactly  everyone has to start somewhere .
- - Wow that would be crazy . That makes sweeps week a whole lot better .
  - And you could draw up extra cards before the runner runs HQ .
- - So what happened to the reply girls 
  - Youtube probably changed their rules . Now channels only making reply videos get deleted . That s my guess anyway .
- - I feel like that shirt has limited utility  but I m still jelly as fuck .
  - It has my user name and a number on the back too  I m just incapable of taking a photo of my back .
- - I never liked Fucale  Dude has nt been tested all tourny and now he s in the gold medal game .
  - Yeah that was a strange call I agree . Ca nt be playing sloppy giving up all these penalties though . Oh and sorry about your thread bro .

  - I guess they re egos are soon to turn into a desolate wasteland of yesteryear then .

- - Can you give me a quick explanation how it is  Also  which Gibson  teh .
  - William Gibson  one of the fathers of cyberpunk . . D Virtual Light is one that comes to mind  but he seems to include them in almost every story .
- - Nerdy thing for me . The Ant-Man trailer came out tonight . Looking good so far but did nt share anything big yet . The shrinking stuff looks cool
  - That movie is either going to be amazing or lame
- - Already done  and with much fewer question marks .
  - Can you send me the link so I can complete mine 
- - I could definitely see Rollins vs Bryan at Fast Lane .
  - Not as long as he still has the briefcase . I m not sure it would make much sense  then .
  - If Rollins takes the pin at Rumble  I highly doubt he would cash in .
  - Right . I think it s kind of exciting . This Rumble is hard to predict .

- - Soooo ... no eyeless widow girlie  Bummer .
  - I was hoping willow got the goths .
- - It all depends on the people op . I personally would not like my girlfriend to propose . I m a bit traditional I guess .
  - This is the answer I have expected to be the most common . I get that and will probably honestly end up being the one who proposes despite my beliefs .
- - I m drinking a little beer and messing around a bit on the internet . How about you .
  - I just got a little hungry so I made myself a piece of toast . How s the beer

  - Yup . FNV modding can be daunting to new users  but it can also easily become addicting . D
- - God  if I could only get this though the head of my tumblr headed teenage daughter .
  - You re not gon na get any teenager to embrace this  honestly .

- - Why what have they done to you 
  - He s just mad cause he sympathizes with black people but he does nt personally know any .
- - Way to quote yourself . Is it aggression when the librarian asks for your library card 
  - It s aggression when you provide one and a cop is called to kill you .
- - I know exactly how hard it is . That s why I wo nt believe that it exists until I see a usable  feature complete beta .
  - Well  I have seen it  I tested it and it worked for me . I am sure that they will open the beta testing sooner or later .
- - I just emailed a major police department with the question on whether someone else reporting it would be useful .
  - I would expect a police department to take the position that those who have knowledge of crimes should report them to the police .
  - But that is nt what I was asking so hopefully they answer my question .
  - I hope you do nt think it will prove anything . I am genuinely uninterested in any words that come out of a cop s mouth or fingers .
  - Then that is your problem . Not mine . I try and believe experts as long as it passes the smell test .
  - Police are not experts in being the victim of a crime .
- - Ehhh ... maybe chapped . Could ve been waving it out the window in the cold to kill time .

  - Brian has his own points of contention with the whole situation . But I think since he still works for UFC  he ll be pretty PC .
- - Poor Gradkowski . He was almost the hero  then Roethlisberger zeros just to ice the cake .
  - Seriously  he tore it up in his incredibly short time
- - I never really liked Ali  he was a great fighter but he loved to run his mouth alot and that s not what being a man is about .
  - Having a big mouth is one thing . Having a big mouth  some good points and huge success is another .

  - You re right  but I did nt get this from my friends .
