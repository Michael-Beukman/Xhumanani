  - It s even more amazing when you realize that he s also Ryan Seacrest .
- - I will buy Freedom Wars five times over if i have to . Games worth it .
  - Same  it s got a lot of potential and I d happily re invest in the game if it meant more Freedom Wars on the Vita

  - Stupidly easy to avoid though . I do nt bother attacking AA because it s a waste of rockets and there are Tigers that need exploding .
- - oh right . I guess at first he s just trying to get her attention .
  - I think most of the books knocked off the shelf are when he s just freaking out and yelling and punching the bookshelf from inside the tesseract .

  - Yeah because the police will get right on that .

- - Off topic  but what UI are you using 
  - Ha we both posted at same time with same interest xD
- - What if you dug around the giant core of lava 
  - Then you would nt be digging through the center .
- - i want it so bad but im afraid it s going to be impossible to get like villager and rosalina preorders
  - It better not be a store exclusive . And I d imagine there s going to be a LOT of people watching and waiting for pre-orders of her to go live .

  - I think im going to pass but thanks for the offer 
- - I love the third shot there with the broken down skyscrapers .
  - Yea  the re quite nice . Ill have to get the new version which adds far more skyscrapers and distant LOD  which should look even better 
- - It says it s unstable  mostly like people ca nt even play it  and there does nt seem to be anything new or interesting .
  - It s a lot more stable than the nightly builds  and where did you get the idea of there not being anything new  There are a lot of changes .
- - Alright  that one looks real . Are you her  Cause the pictures get progressively better .
  - haha I had a feeling someone would think that . No it s not me  her Facebook is full of gold though .
- - To each his own on the Air Ball  I found it amusing . So did everyone around me in Section N .
  - I loved the air ball harassment as well . It seemed to get into their players heads at least a little bit .
- - Is that why you punish them with severe debt when they finally grow up 
  - debt and a ruined environment are our monument to our children
- - Discogs . It was repressed last year .
  - Now if they could just get around to repressing How Strange  Innocence ...
- - NGE  More like CU and after .
  - Yeah  CU killed it  NGE was just the final nail .
- - Looks almost exactly like a girl I know .
  - Get her to recreate it then hold a trial .

  - It s more than Rome II  I actually think the provincial system is really well balanced and strategic now .
- - They have very strong visible evidence that he did . Make him an example .
  - I know he did ... I do nt get your point . Why do you think it s so bad 
- - I m confused by your question . You can not see where you re going on the minimap 
  - No I can see on the minimap but it s limited and I like to see where the animals are located . I like to see everything basically
- - Can be either . Take a test and be sure .
  - Negative  Thanks for encouraging the peace of mind .
- - Yeah doing it on this one game type should nt hurt in the long run
  - Especially if it s done early enough so that it s the precedent .
- - dense nugs isnt really a strain determining factor
  - Yes it is . It is influenced by conditions  but density is mostly due to genetics .
- - What did she do wrong  Looks like she was holding it right . Do you think she loosen her grip or is she just too weak for that gun 
  - Maybe she should have held on loosely but not let go ...

- - I love that Paige s first appearance on the show as a cast member is by drugging Nattie .
  - They wanted to debut her as a babyface .
- - I ve seen it like that once  was fucking annoying cause I felt I could nt get it all off as easy as a waxy
  - Yeah I dump it out then turn it inside out to scrape it off with a razor .
- - Since it s such a small room i would think that mounting them in the corner of the rooms would give you the best result acoustically .
  - Yep  seems like that s what most people are saying . Thanks 
- - Post boxes definitely wo nt . Some jackass shot one outside my house and it went through and through .
  - Sorry about that . I missed the tree .

  - Would have to agree here  when my hairdresser shampoos my hair it s like heaven the massage feels so good

  - Any suggestions on how to ask her out  I only know her Facebook .
- - It did get released in Korea though . There is nt a big community or anything  but I m pretty sure there is a handful Korean smashers .
  - Perhaps the Koreans do nt think this game worthy of their time then . P Too softcore for them

- - I ve tried so many times to get into that  can never find something that I like enough to stick with so end up going back to normal Windows .
  - You usually have to learn the script bits .
- - Now I want to take some EE courses on this stuff . Thanks for the info

- - Congratulations to Shortbread Finger for being the second best .
  - To honour its position as a finalist  Shortbread Finger flair has been added 
  - I think we should honour the Chocolate Hobnob with a flair as well . The digestive and chocolate digestive are available  but there s only the plain Hobnob .
  - draw a picture for it and I ll put it on
  - I could nt make you a good picture of a chocolate Hobnob if there was a gun pointed to my head .

  - It does indeed . The background is an image and there s a transparent zooper widget that opens the app drawer over the start button
- - Im just wondering how there is a ward on the map since in both Poro King and Dominion you cant buy wards 
  - When the hacker can chose the map then i think he also can enable wards . D

  - No problem  best of luck to you 
- - I guess we ll just have to wait until next week for Tony Romo to fail in a clutch moment .
  - I ca nt tell if this is some kind of backhanded compliment lol
- - The Patriots have a big fan base in the UK . Just saying .
  - Also the most popular NFL team in Russia . Putin loves us so much he found a way to acquire a Patriots SB ring
- - Derrick Rose is not Josh Smith . If we waive him we re not going to improve dramatically .
  - If he keeps playing like he has we will .
- - There s nothing I can do . I m stuck .
  - Well that sucks . Are you stuck forever or stuck for now 
  - Until I go off to college or university  or until I get kicked out .
  - I really hope you can survive this b.s until you go off to college or university .
- - Check the post history people . It s not him  it s just a dude making a joke .
  - Yeah  I actually only just started hearing about this other chef john . I m not him though .
- - The Who  Lake Street Drive  Paul McCartney  Pink Floyd
  - Good thing Kayne discovered Paul McCartney . He is going to blow up 
- - Fuckin  camp robbers aka gray jays . I had one of these SOBs fly off with an entire bag of beef jerky .
  - They are shameless opportunists and not to be trusted . The next photo is probably of his wife missing her jacket  hat  and beer . RIP beef jerky bag .
- - I like using shimmery neutral colors  like Maybelline Color Tattoo in Bad to the Bronze or any of the neutral LOreal Infallible colors .
