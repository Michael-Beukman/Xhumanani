- - thats not a glitch ... your character is supposed to be black ...
  - The NBA games have the same problem .
- - You do realize Paul Pierce is older than Kobe right 
  - Yes . What does that have to do with anything 
- - No  it s the style of the video and the appearance of the people in it more than anything . The language used as well .
  - Well the style of the video is obviously being used to invoke emotion in the watcher . Most of the people are also going to look conservative .
- - Survive because my loved one is carrying a gun and can stop the attack . Why do you call the police when you are being brutally assaulted

  - Right  I feel like that would be the minimum thing to put in a mixing controller . And thank you my friend 
- - I disagree to be honest - he was ok  at best and still missing fairly straightforward chances . Also do nt think he works hard enough to justify not scoring .
  - Fair enough . Ca nt agree on everything .
- - In all seriousness  I never really understood the reason for Java s insistence on this  since there are ways around it  which lead to code like this .

  - Word . DVD and streaming are the shit .
  - DVD  what is this  the stone age 
- - You need to get into the open-source scene . Get involved in projects  start your own etc .

  - Hopefully good enough to get you off 
- - There were reports of input lag on the old Mayflash adapters . I d be cautiously optimistic if I were you
  - Lag because they plugged into the wiimotes  this plugs directly into the USB ports of the Wii U
  - There s still input lag on the USB ones .
  - I own the gamecube to usb adapter by mayflash for a while now and never have I experienced any input lag . Any lag would come from the game itself .
- - Tell you to calm down when you are angry .
  - CALM DOWN        Oh  well now that you ve said it ... I suddenly feel serene . Thank you .

- - For what they charge I do nt understand how they make money .
  - They may only make a dollar of profit per package but when they deal with millions and millions of packages then all those dollars add up .

  - That s what makes this prediction so bold
- - Is Slovenia a safe place to travel to 
  - Yes  Slovenia has low crime rate in general . You should nt be too worried when you re here . People are friendly to foreigners .
  - The fact that this needs to be pointed out shows you how much Eastern Europe s reputation has suffered during the Cold War .
  - Not Yugoslavia s reputation . Yugoslavia had kind of good relationship with both sides .
- - The problem is you need a navy and power projection to defend the Falklands .
  - And if we learn from America and put the bases for these power projectors in struggling EU countries  we can kill two birds with one stone 
- - So we re almost halfway through the season . Who is your MVP on the hawks so far  Who has been the biggest disappointment 
  - Obviously Kane . Most improved is Versteeg imo . Most hated . ROSIVAL

- - I am glad they have the gay pride colors for him
  - no is talking about how funny and brilliant his cameo was .
- - I genuinely wish more people thought like you do and it made me happy to see your post at the top of the thread
  - I seriously appreciate it and we need people that think like us if we re going to change things .
- - More importantly  what is happening to your pinky toe ... ew .

  - Artemis only gives it s benefits of LRM spread reduction and lock time reduction if the mech that has it equipped has it s own line of sight .
- - Unless the shields somehow negate any type of shock from impact I think it s pretty reasonable not being able to sprint .
  - They literally disintegrate the bullets . And it is nt physically around the Spartan  but on the outside .
- - Came here to state the obvious  but ... for fuck s sake  please stop texting and driving .
  - And  you know  getting behind the wheel when you re completely wasted
- - First line would have been lw marleau c Thornton rw voracek or totw Callahan . Goalie totw fluery . Vancouver arena . Do nt remember the score tho .
  - Oh haha  do nt remember that game then ... I play a little too much lol .

  - The store in the client  not the in game store  just FYI
- - Judging by this gif  you re undecided on whether it is a masterpiece or it is nt .

- - Your height is fine . I ve just learned to keep my arms and legs inside the ride at all times .

- - And yet I still enjoyed it  not gon na lie . Better than the other two shitfests at least
  - At least the other two had plots .
- - App works great for me . No issues with Imager or GIFs  etc . Perhaps you just have a bad install or something .

- - I think force wielders lose most of their power while they re dying .
  - And some become more powerful than you could ever imagine .

- - Yea that s true . My only reference is hearing on the podcasts . For all I know maybe he was very well spoken . My bad everyone  Jeez lol
  - no need for an apology . you were stating how you felt and some people ca nt handle anyone saying anything without reading something inflammatory into it .
- - What s the point of this  they re just copies of other famous album covers .
  - They re not copies . They re variations of things that already exist . You could say the same thing about almost all music .
- - That was the most bizarre thing I ve seen this year .
  - At four days in I doubt it will be beat .
- - Or you just have different circles of friends . Or you want to do both PvE and PvP and each guild focuses on just one .
  - of course you there maybe reasons . But in the end which guild do you dedicate your time and effort to  if two conflict which one will you prioritize 
- - Rooney should let Mata take FKs  he misses way too much .
  - Seriously mata has such a good free kick
- - To be fair  Dark lives in South America and has a dearth of good people to play with
  - this comment becomes much less confusing when I accepted that I did nt know what dearth meant . Realized my mistake and now I feel better .
- - If you could get to choose your lane before queueing like in teambuilder perhaps
