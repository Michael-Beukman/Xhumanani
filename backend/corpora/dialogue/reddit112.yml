- - If Nanamo dies  they ll just replace her with another hamster and pretend that it did nt happen .
  - She s going to the farm where she can run around and have fun with all the other hamsters .
- - Hey guys  can you let me in on what all the kool aid talk is about 
  - Drinking the Koolaid is a phrase that typically means follow with blind faith . So naturally  it relates to Lions fans .
  - Well said . Do nt forget the suicide aspect .
  - I m trying not to scare off the fresh blood .
- - Little Big Man  Into the West  Griffith s America   The Patriot  True Grit . John Adams is the best though .
  - Thanks  I ve seen The Patriot and True Grit . Both are good ones . I ll check out the others .
- - I do nt think any of these stories are myths  pretty sure these fat people go through this shit .
  - Edited . Sorry  replied to wrong person in an effort to echo your point .
- - It s in a place where they do nt end sentences with prepositions .
  - Now that s a place I m about .
- - This Tim Hortons Dark Roast bullshit is getting out of hand
  - It s pretty shitty coffee too . I do nt understand why they re still trying to push it .
- - I like to ask people how they d feel if Adam Sandler was considered the national voice of white America . Not so comfy  is it 
  - David Duke would be a more fair comparison - but even Duke does nt start riots over lies .
- - its all about context and how its executed .
  - it all about control and if you can take it
- - Wait ... why would Bryan beat Cena or Reigns  Surely weight would be a huge issue here 
  - It would be . But I do nt think enough to compensate for them having zero MMA skills and Bryan being a grappler who knows jujitsu .
- - I bring grams upon grams back from Chicago to Cincinnati by just putting it in vitamin pills . Never had an issue .
  - Me and a buddy tried that but I realized quickly that it was a nuisance to get back out of the pill .
- - Pretty screwed but I know what date it is at all times .
  - You would be able to keep a pretty detailed log of your experience at least 
- - Valve does nt even read their tech support requests  there s no way they ll read this .
  - Their support team is understaffed  maybe that s why they take so long to read the requests .
- - It says the retail employee got a pay raise too
  - From a mandatory federal raise of the minimum wage .
- - I ll play . What song do we start with 
  - Pick any you like  i did rolling stone
- - This is really cool  Where did you find this 
  - Looks like he made it himself  but would nt mind one myself .
- - You look like an electronic music artist .
  - haha  i ll take that as compliment
- - If anything  the kid analogy is awkward somewhat as US is a bit younger than Russia .
  - Russia is the inept parent that the kid has to take care of because they keep trying to kill themselves .
- - I started woodworking as a hobby a couple of years ago  and I m intending on making it a living . New life .
  - I started woodworking too when I quit 
- - This is clearly against TOS but GGG IF YOU RE LISTENING ... I would pay for a minimalist discharge mtx 
  - Wtb mushroom cloud discharge mtx . Smoke mine on a whole new scale .
- - Pffft  and it s not even mechanical .
  - Are there any good island style keyboards  I love them way more than the large mechanical keyboards .
- - And that s strange  considering it has the most similar culture to America of all the European countries .
  - Has it  How do you think they re similar  If we re talking sporting cultures here I think they re really different .
- - I think he read your comment as  what the flying fuck .
  - Ahhh  now that makes more sense . Terrible  terrible  sense .
- - They did another manufacture run of him so expect him back in stock in a few weeks .
  - Is nt that just a rumor though  I do nt see how any of us can know for sure .
- - Expected that to be a euphemism for drugs ... but probably not . But of all the bars I ve been to  have nt seen any darts yet 
  - Yeah its pretty much just billiards around these parts .
- - Yes flip tricks tiger claws . Less dancing oriented . Yeah the tomahawk is a bit heavy but thanks for the recommendation .
  - Aight  it was the first one that popped into my mind . I do nt even have that much freestyle knowledge tbh
- - You did nt even get that legit since someone was using a cheated mask to begin with .
  - Well  I do nt plan on playing with another hacker .
- - I am going to just pay off the card I loaded it with
  - And this is why we ca nt have nice things 
- - My brother works in Dubai and we talk on skype all the time  so uhhh what 
  - Tell your bro to prepare for some coerced labor .
- - According to her  that s just an oddly shaped  overcooked potato .
  - She can tell it to the judge 
- - If she was black they d blame the cops for tackling her while she held a knife .
  - If she was unarmed  yeah  but let s just leave that part out .
- - Time looks about right  but that is a different boat . Cheers .
  - Ah  too bad . The location and the border around the jib seemed too coincidental .
- - Thank you for answering . I tend to be on the side of nothing is actually necessary  but respect people who can back up their opinions
  - I can understand that position . And I m always happy to talk about the science behind it .
- - yup  they are a loot chest with legs  similar to the goliath slot machines .
  - I think they self-destruct after a time  so you need to be quick about grabbing the loot
- - That was a pretty good article . But did the beavers come back or not 
  - No  nothing to eat . They love willow . Aspen  not so much .
- - I might have two riffs  should I do both in one week or would that be cheating 
  - I think it d be best spread out over two weeks . That way you have two chances to win 
- - Yeah  I think that s the rub . If this was a white card  it would nt be as interesting .
  - It s pretty strictly not in white s color pie . This is a blue effect just really cheaply costed ...
- - Hayes has been ramming his ass into Haas and Hammons  backs all night . Probably how Hammons got hurt .
  - Yeah ca nt even give us a replay of it
- - This is white Mardu card  yo .
  - Poorly explained  but the man makes a good point . AFAIK this is the first card we ve seen in FRF that is purely in it s clans enemy colour .
- - Leah charges at it  attempting to scratch at it s eyes and blind it .
  - Leah is unable to get to it .
  - Leah grabs her knives off the floor  and attempts to stab the metagross in the eyes .
  - The metagross seems to be slowing  and you hit it . It jerks back .

  - I can not believe the level of reading comprehension on this website .
- - I m still disappointed Norm Macdonald did nt get it .
  - I m still disappointed Michael Ian Black did nt get it .
- - If that floor mat is a precursor to you joining up with that emblem you better get all your anarchist ways out now .
  - First world anarchy in the Marine Corps for me was getting a low reg every week .
- - Pat McAfee is probably more we ll known by now  but he fit that description perfectly the past couple years . Now  I d say maybe Donte Moncrief .
  - Not my Dad but my mother Loves Newsome since he went to Ball State so he probably qualifies for a lot of Colts fans .
- - Hey guys  I m moving to Nashville .
  - We could always use more guys here  Lol

  - Good call ... still drug addled regardless I guess ...

  - Took a while longer to get them on Eu than it took to get them on NA .
- - Congrats on the kill  Off topic  but what raid unit frames are those 
  - Character and target frames are Shadowed Unit Frames . Raid frames are the Blizzard stock . I use Clique to mouseover all my Hands .
- - Sure  might be true to some extent . But what is this supposed to explain again 
  - It explains why they are the most popular wallet with the worst security ... burners
- - It looks like the music is about to make her head explode .
  - It looks exactly like a B-grade horror movie  right before the head - exploding scene
- - Belgium remains neutral in this War on terror  obviously .
  - Well I think the French Freedom Forces killed the terrorists .
- - I had nt really considered that  but it makes perfect sense . Appreciate the feedback

  - No ... they they may pick you off randomly .
- - so u think she slept at some other guys house or what

  - Haha yeah I can imagine there s a huge mystery behind some peoples attempts . Thanks
- - Kosovo does nt have anything to do with this year  it s been going on since the fall of Yugo
  - The same could be said for virtually all the conflicts in this comic . Good comic  though .
- - simon died  mard geer  hades  most of grimore hearts also died  shall i continue 
  - I would nt count Mard . He s probably just trapped in that book .
- - good find op  could nt make it past the half mark .
  - Glad someone felt the same thing I did
- - do you reckon its worth reading all of the manga . or can I just start where the anime left off 
  - Read where the anime left off . the manga is just uncensored in some scenes no big changes .
- - Not sure if real program or subtle rape ad ...
  - real program  attempting to keep people new to kink from hurting one another accidentally . There is no way i am covering consensual non consent with newbies .
- - Where can I buy bras from Japan without going there 
  - That s close to impossible . Japan does nt really do as much online shopping as you d think  and they never really ship outside the country .
- - How the fuck did you do that .
  - Was about to say  this is some airshow stuff  Teach me 
- - First time I ve attempted adding my own extensions . Spent a good chunk of last night removing all the grips and tape from the clubs

  - I saw him wrestle a few months ago at a local show  he s still a beast
- - Dude  no  do nt take clothes from dead people and start selling them . That s just wrong .
  - You have clearly never played Dwarf Fortress . Selling dead people s clothes is the foundation for a thriving economy 
- - Metaknight mains are truly the lowest of the low in the Smash community
  - Scrub mentality . Why should nt everyone use the broken characters while they re legal 
- - Ovi is a beast  no denying that . I just feel like he already gets enough attention . Let s highlight some of the new  exciting players .
  - I really think stars of the week should be about acknowledging the best players that week  not highlighting new players .
- - When cheese melts the cheese atoms start vibrating at a tastier frequency and fuse better with your tongue atoms .
  - Actually it s down to the frequency the cheese atoms resonate when hot and melted . In become in phase with that of the exited tongue molecules and so amplifies pleasure
- - So when you meet someone you pull out your app and plug in their demographic data to decide which unprotected activities are on the table

  - was this a repost  I did nt see it before
- - Well  it was more about communism  but sure  keep at it with the conspiracies .
  - Communism was an excuse  not a reason . Just like terrorism
  - The USSR was very much a totalitarian communist state .
  - That s not communism . It s stalinism
- - No - I get that . But explain why that is ignorant . You may not like it  but that does not make it ignorant .
  - Apparently it s ignorant to criticize a religion that condones stoning homosexuals to death .
- - Psh  move to the correct side of the continent please .
  - Okay  can I live with you  Also please find me a job . And them I m there .
- - Sorry silver noob here  why is plat so bad 
  - Because Plat is Silver multiplied by hey look at my ego  it s through the roof cuz im plat .
- - I for one felt that he spoke about the girls in a condescending way
  - Keep in mind he refers to them as females  not exactly something ladies men do .
- - I did this as a way to get my feelings out  and to maybe help others who lost a child way to early ...
  - Did you get any financial benefit from the interview 
- - The Office ... with the return of Michael Scott
  - I dunno  I really like the way it ended .
- - That s dangerously close to victim-blaming pal . Are you saying that people with public personas online share some blame or deserve less sympathy for being attacked 
  - No  I m saying the internet is a shitty place  and the more you are on it the shittier it gets .
- - cowboys fans are almost as mad as lions fans were last sunday
  - The refs are just biased towards Aaron Rodgers and the Packers again .
- - Looks great . I like the electrical tape on there  gives it some texture .
  - Thank you  I definitely did nt like the look of the ugly red text on the side of PVC pipes .
- - I had the wrong idea of who the story was about until I read the Cash Money records part . I thought the news anchor had nicknames I was unaware of .
  - My whole perception of news anchor Brian Williams was briefly  but completely  shattered . I feel such relief knowing it was nt him .
- - I d say competitive powerlifting at whatever weightclass but omit your total . You also get repetitive with the software things .
  - thank you  i ll omit the total and try to talk about something else
- - So you re saying his comment was a carbon copy of another 
  - Where are you going with this  Am I missing some blatant contextual or username reference here 
- - Call the admin office or phys dept office 
  - Good idea -- I ll try tomorrow if i ca nt find anything .
- - No  the issue is citizenship . Citizenship is valuable .
  - Many things are valuable which are not commodities . Citizenship is also not a commodity  or at least it should nt be .
- - It certainly is nt illegal to top up someone s meter where I live . That is wonky and I ve never heard of it . Nice straw man though .
  - It s not a straw man  it s a real-world example .
- - How do they get it on  It seems to be a good fit  is the jersey really stretchy 
  - Probably has a front and a back piece .
- - A score for how long an individual player has been within the hill edit . read the question incorrectly  SH should do this I meant
  - That is really hard to do unless SHG put it on the scoreboard .
  - I dont know how it works but they could add it to the scoreboard after the game surely 
  - MLG could nt do that  but they could have a few officials back stage watching and counting each players time in the hill although it would nt be very accurate .
- - Tony is such a piece of shit .
  - What did I ever do to you 
- - Do nt go with the flow just for the sake of it . Make your own path and follow it .
  - you know what goes with the flow  dead fishes .
- - Your beliefs are your own and you re entitled to them . I do nt feel like debating .
  - Of course . Hope you have a great day 
- - Then Lysa . Point being we both agree . the apple does nt fall far from the tree here .
  - What harm did Lysa s actions do to the Vale exactly 
- - You could of just exited to the main menu and when you came back your ship would of been outside the station .
  - For the Empire s sake . Could have  would have .
- - really glad to see that mcdonalds does nt discriminate against the blind
  - In just really glad Helen was able to find work
- - I m pretty sure it s not hard to find folks who can run a cash register .
  - You d think that  but you ve probably never had the responsibility of hiring people
- - Confusing correlation and causation is a common mistake .
  - Not confused  decidedly obvious in this case . Read the dogma of the Koran and the vitriol spewed forth by Islamic religious leaders .
- - Where are you getting those figures from if you do nt mind me asking
  - Figures  Who needs figures when you ve got a feeling  in your gut .
- - I d do pit for fox captain and zelda and pay for your shipping .
  - Yeah  I ll pass . I can buy a Pit for less than the cost of three regular amiibo figures . Thanks the same .
- - He has the right to not be offended 
  - Just because you re offended does nt mean you re right . Not that we re trying to be . Right  that is .
- - U guys shud b more care ful . May be get wallet so u do not keep losing cards 
  - You re like Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy .
- - You probably did nt get the DLC  but it actually goes a ways explaining this part of the game  which I also had a lot of problems with initially .
  - I ve heard they retroactively give a secret timey-wimey justification for Daisy s actions  which otherwise would be incredibly out of character and nonsensical .
- - And you needed a lightning connector and radio shack did nt have em stocked or even the sears catalogue .
  - And when you did you always had to wait for a thunderstorm ...
- - ohh  thats what i was talking about  the wiimote things
  - Oh yeah lol they did nt change much but you have to buy new ones which sucks
- - Total Biscuit choosed it as best game of the year .
  - Total Biscuit is a self serving shitbag though .
- - Yeah  I m just not sure why you replied with that .
  - Yeah ... It s OK . I know  and that s bad enough .
- - Until you realize what his auto range is .
  - That s true that his Auto range is smallish but he has his hook to close the gap and the his flay and box help them not leave
- - But now this fight is pretty pointless for Brown . Yeah yeah I know it s Cerrone but people will be a little put off by him being a lightweight .
  - You ai nt a hitter and would nt understand .
- - Not my game  I just wanted to share it .
  - Not with that attitude it ai nt . Now get back out there and finish your game
- - Daily reminder that the ICANN changes allowing non-Latin charters are going to make the internet and scams worse for all of us .
  - I hope they do nt go Unicode on this .
- - A woman in Berlin  is a good account of this .
  - I read this in history class . Very nasty stuff .
- - I check Xur every week expecting to see good loot for sell .
  - Omg me too  I thought I was the only one 
- - Not just a great article  but that site has a lot of fun lists to read . Characters without flaws suck 
  - I m slowly making my way through the site too . It s great 
- - The real question is can he count to potato .
  - I bet he ll only ever count to firetruck .
- - Maybe a real one  instead of the obviously defective Chinese knockoff you have .
  - I have owned three of them  all bought from the US and certified genuine ones . Speaking from experience and after multiple failed chances that I gave them .
- - Sion s skins looks bad compared to his default skin  also his default skin is awesome too
  - I miss the old sion default skin . Green man with giant axe  goofy running animation  and hilarious lifesteal .
- - Chris Tucker . How the fuck are these two mixed up so often .
  - For me I mix them up because of their first name and they re both really loud and often make very crude jokes
- - I clicked  hoping for a video but was disappointed .
  - I searched Google hoping for a video but was disappointed
- - As a former electrician  I do nt know what he wants either .
  - It seems he wants an electrocution or fire if he is doing his own wiring with such an obviously small knowledge of electrics
- - Do you know why guerrillas have such big nostrils  Because they have big fingers .
  - I really hope you meant guerrilla and not gorilla because a bunch of dudes hiding in the woods picking their huge noses with huge fingers made me feel a little better today
- - Maxwell is probably the only low point to that first team . That Centre back pairing though ... I want it ...
  - So you d choose the first squad 
- - I ve only ever had weed  but shrooms sound pretty fucking awesome from that description .
  - It is nt like that . He s exaggerating .
- - You do realize that what he sells is random right 
  - Is it  though  It sure does nt seem like it .
- - Does nt the mud lake freeze in the winter 
  - I think it is a pit rather than a lake .
- - Iceland . See the logo on the ticket .
  - I live and learn . Thanks  Did nt even know Iceland had kr . I should ve known .
- - You are correct  I am difficult to please
  - Probably would steer clear of Tinder then 
- - I just always assumed that hypertrophy training was way easier than strength training . It s not as systemically taxing or whatever  but it is a different kind of animal
  - It s really good feeling in the same way . A prideful exhaustion .
- - You can choose those exact options in the interactive menu ...
  - Sorry . I meant it should prompt you when spawning in
- - Yes  they re all DVDs . I have nt switched to BR yet  for a multitude of reasons .
  - No problem sticking with DVD . Nice haul . Just curious what are your reasons for no Blu-ray
- - It s Portland . Coke is too mainstream .
  - RC is rare enough in the northwest that sometimes we prefer it .
- - i can get you julius next time its available . we will keep in touch . I have a crap load of sip right now also .
  - I d love to get my hands on some sip if you like anything I have or I can get you I m in New Jersey
- - Hold on Give me a few seconds . And ill start inviting the first five people
  - Pass me up . It is nt allowing me to get on Destiny at the moment .
- - Maybe you can teach me about how to prioritize traffic for certain ip addresses within my router . I m using DDWRT firmware with my Linksys router .
  - Sorry bud . That s above my paygrade .
- - You can us WER without being online .
  - It s not opening for us . Really odd .
- - Looking forward to your next update  BTW .
  - Hopefully it wo nt be to far away in the future .
- - His special move is summoning an active oil rig under enemies  feet .
  - And an american fighter summons a burger 
- - Yeah but you can still wear clothing with colour AND style in a corporate setting . Fuck light blue dress shirts and khaki pants .
  - Any suggested alternatives  I d say save the wilder patterns for ties and maybe jackets .
- - Stimulating listening . This is the first I ve heard of this particular podcast  but it s on my radar now . Thanks for that .
  - Absolutely  and thanks for the comment . We re glad you enjoyed it .
- - You can go to jail in the us for not going to school fyi . The parents can also get in trouble .
  - But the US still does not have people finishing high school despite the threat of arrest .
- - someone else has the same issue ... try a different browser . I m using Firefox .
  - I am using Chrome . I wonder if that is it . Thanks for the tip .
- - That lamp ... And the bedsheets ... How was this ever considered stylish 
  - But to be ... You know ... Nice ... She was an awesome human being . Never wanted the attention and did good with it .
- - I think that would have created a muslim belief that the united states was trying to embark on a holy war .
  - Most still do so it would nt had have any difference .
- - The supreme court just ruled that employers can make you wait UNPAID up to an hour for security screening . Not directly on topic but similar .
  - We have no such screening i show up ready to go .
- - Which movie or tv series is this 
  - Arrow . It starts off not that impressive  but gets better and better . Kinda like this show in a way .
- - Literally everything that Gamergate has has tried to do has backfired on them in some major way .
  - Give it a year  and the tune with completely change . Gamergate will suddenly become a false flag operation to make all gamers look bad .
- - Free for all on floating rotating space debris on the reef . having to navigate colliding ship parts  adds and a massive boss would be so wonderfully wild .
  - it would be the grand spectacle that destiny deserves
- - Primary elections . What a waste of time and money . Just let the parties have a convention and pick who they want to run .
  - I m an American and I think the whole two party system is dumb . It takes a whole range of ideologies and puts them under the same banner .
- - Every time Lindley drops back I m thinking . man  what could have been for Arizona with Palmer .
  - Me too  man . Me too .
- - Does the Master Chief get any weapons  They can probably ding his shields down sooner or later  and it is a lot of tanks .

  - So you going to sleep the pain off

- - Was nt this posted before  As long as Neuer is around  best GK in the world belongs to him .
  - I had a quick search and could nt see it posted before . Sorry if it has already been .
- - This is a feature on every road bike  is it not 
  - I do nt usually see them on the sissy bar like that myself . The spot where the kit is is hidden behind the backseat also .
- - i would nt say its a better photo  but another angle .
  - It also appears to be an entirely different nose and propeller .
- - Well your comment made me think of it . Now  lets wait and see 
  - Will OPs thoughts deliver  Who knows 
- - You could use an aquarium pump  a mini fountain pump  or a fish bubble .
  - It comes down to size and battery draw . I m familiar with none .
  - Fountain pumps are the smallest . Little motors draw less power .
  - You could probably get a pager motor  put a very tiny prop on it and stick it into a pen tube
- - You wo nt notice it unless you re looking for it
  - This . I have an app that specifically highlights the areas but with normal use its impossible to notice and has not hindered my experience .
- - Thanks for the tip  I am using an iPad mini  so I will check that one out .
  - I tested it with an iPad mini and it works as well 
- - I am ready to cancel my service and tether through my phone if i get a data cap .
  - You ll have a hard time finding a phone plan without a data cap .
- - Thank you for the response . Would you be changing anything from the deck moving forward or will it depend on the metagame 
  - yeah probably cut an ashiok in the board for a despise or a cure 
- - Take your time . Just shoot me another message when you re close and I ll hop on .
  - Hey  sorry about the delay  I totally forgot about your request while adding others . If you can get online I ll trade as soon as I see you .
  - No worries at all . I can forget about hatch request for days sometimes  so I certainly ca nt fault a half an hour .
  - Let me know if I sent the right egg and sorry again for the delay 
- - christ how can you say all that without knocking on wood
  - because my thoughts and opinions have no bearing on the outcome of the game 
- - I m sure there will be new ones by launch . I have my fingers crossed for an assassination with the blade of the gravity hammer .
  - Or maybe hit them like it was a baseball bat  xD
- - Wow . Heard him on Chicago radio not that long ago saying he has no interest in running a team or even consulting .
  - I believe he said ESPN had journalistic integrity and he did nt want to leave them .
- - You keep saying that  like it s going to come true .
  - What will Obama do when the Keystone is put in a different bill  a much bigger one that has to pass 
- - Valid point . I still think that there is a compromise somewhere .
  - Like smoking rooms  Toronto already tried that and it failed miserably .
- - Great to see you  Have a nice holiday 
  - Yes  Did you  Get baby stuff 
  - About a month . We re having a girl  but went gender-neutral on the decorations . Also  we just love Studio Ghibli films .

  - I do nt think it s true  why would it be
- - I do nt understand with this potato image .
  - sorry it s phone being a potato but it s the little plastic piece that s over things
- - Cheers mate  glad to know the work is appreciated .
  - Did nt think you made it  sorry .
- - You seem not to be able to comprehend what is happening . You should be fighting terrorism  not attacking Islam .
  - tacking Islam will only create more idiot extremists . You are actually not helping of making a better world .
