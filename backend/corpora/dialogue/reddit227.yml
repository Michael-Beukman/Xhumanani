  - Get into it  man  I love all the Culture books .
- - Brandon Carr  That guy has stepped up today .
  - I do nt know why people are disagreeing with you  he s had some big plays .
  - Who knows . People in this thread are also saying Bailey and Romo suck  so I m not exactly worried about it .
  - Now we re close to making it a one possession game and people are acting like the game is over .
- - have u ever been there and followed their advice  also its full of paranoid addicts who are accusing everyone of oddswaying . Its a terrible place .
  - welcome to a betting site on the internet .

- - Brazil  Have a safe flight . D
  - Thanks for participating  I want to visit there one day 
- - So jazzed . Indianapolis here . Saw the two ladies I used to bum cigarettes off of smoking in the parking garage as I strolled into a heated walkway .
  - The cold does nt feel so bad when you can stroll in the heated walkway 
- - Sterling Archer  maybe he ll kill house .
  - You d think in some odd way they could end up being the best of friends .
- - Meh  a center punch will do the job fine if you do nt need it to look pretty .
  - Does nt really work well on a gas key
- - Good thing . That s a ... SLIPPERY SLOPE . Ah  Ah 
  - Here  have an up vote for trying ...
- - I suppose I m not interested in discussing what makes a true Scotsman .
  - What does a Malthusian do who is nt trying to fix the world  Just fret 
- - So easier to diagnose with a concussion  Roethlisberger or George Foreman 
  - That s Ben s secret . He s always concussed .
- - I just park my car in my garage and I do nt have to worry about it .
  - Good to know . I ll be sure to bring a garage to work with me tomorrow .
- - Also  the walking dead comic is violent as fuck . It s borderline snuff and torture . To be on TV  quite a bit has to be changed
  - Yeah like when that chick shits on a spoon and scoops out that dudes eye .
- - Um ... they re making baby stoats 
  - One of them must have been meditating in their Zen garden .
- - Evidence has shown that focused fire actually increases DPS . And its special perk is a must .

- - No  there is not a difference in FM between the two .
  - Ty - was curious if I missed something - like higher speed before wing rip  etc
- - I just rub it in after I get out  it only takes a really small amount to coat the whole thing .
  - Nice  also makes for a great anti-bacterial moisturizer good for anywhere really  germ fighting naturally whitening toothpaste  and natural lubricant
- - Same thing happened to us when we lost to VAN then beat the ducks
  - and actually we beat ottawa and then winnipeg on road back to backs as well there is one positive from the season so far
- - Safe to assume once they have gained that much access  all bets are off . Just strip it all down and start over again .
  - Yeah  there could be a backdoor they left behind somewhere and they are just waiting to get back in .
- - This is a strong competitor . If someone gets Ouya Everywhere running on this their would be no point in buying a Ouya .
  - Indeed . It costs about the same  and has much better specs .
- - Right at this exact moment  or the general state of my life  I m hoping for the latter .
  - Both I guess  but more the general state of your life . You could have everything in your life  but if you are depressed it ruins everything .
- - Finally  a realistic body type on this sub  Me gusta .
  - For some reason that really makes it so much hotter .
- - Wow  I thought I was the only one but I am in the same exact situation as you .
  - Nothing wrong with this at all  Anyone can be a fan of any team .
- - Pooh . I ll see what I can do . Thanks for all that detail 
  - No problem  I would nt wish the PC issues I used to have on anyone . I hope everything works out for you .
- - So basically  the correct interpretation of the bible is what most of the educated people at a given time claim that it is 
  - I do nt know that education has even a partial order  much less a total order  and education is nt the sole qualifier for being good at interpreting scripture .
- - fuzzy pants . fuzzy pants . fuzzy pants . that s awesome 
  - I have my sights set on some ridiculous sweater pants once I can fit into them .
- - And I would take KO s word on this . He s a huge and avid collector and knows baseball history better than most humans ever had .
  - Yeah  the guy is arrogant but he knows his baseball cards .
- - She s your ex for a reason goddammit  do nt you forget it .
  - Yeah  she would yawn for anyone .
- - I do nt think it was mean spirited . The Colts blitzed . If you are gon na keep playing aggressively  ca nt be mad the Cowboys did the same .
  - Basically . If the opponent is still stepping on the gas  you should  too .
- - I thought the holding call on Levy was worse than the PI
  - Eh  that call was pretty clear cut . Levy tackled Randle . That was a penalty .
- - Have sex with my boss . Shes hot as hell but I dont think shes into it
  - Not into sex  Or not into sex with you 
- - That is way too complicated . Are you sure you would not get confused 
  - Hide it in the options menu and set the default to GvG . If you are to confused to benefit ... no worries .
- - Hoping for a repeat performance from the Pack .
  - If the game is kept low scoring  that is fine
- - That s every country  No . That s every question on there  No . That s people from the Islamic world believing in Islam .

- - These are standalone distros  as in wiping out the original ChromeOS and just using Linux  or dual booting  right  Not compatible with Crouton 
  - You are correct . Although  with Crouton you do nt have much to worry about since its using all of Google s drivers .
- - Rodgers  He won me the fantasy football league title . Now I root for him all the time .
  - I too became a Rodgers fan this season .
- - I do nt know that that was dirty . Just cruel .
  - Not that incident but  typically girls fight dirty .
- - I ca nt agree with most of the Rogan analysis of this fight .
  - I speak shitty spanish  but enough to follow along . If Joe is nut hugging I just switch over
- - Yes . And Blizzard would make less money because people would be less inclined to buy packs .
  - More inclined actually . People would want the competitive advantage of hitting legend  so they would want better cards immediately .
- - It s just as easy for the other person to lie about not having sex
  - But it does mean that whatever passes muster is relatively reliable - two people reported the same thing without necessarily knowing the other would say so .
- - I d genuinely like to see NPCs in this game .
  - Same . Something like Titanfall s grunts would be pretty cool IMO .
  - It would make every battle a great fight . Ghost caps become small wars .
  - Wiping out dozens of them would feel pretty awesome . Add in dynamic scaling i.e . the more people the less NPCs and it could work really well
- - Some of those are fab  Thank you 
  - No problem  Enjoy having your wallet bled dry due to anime merch .
- - Does anyone know if they ll produce any more for retail  Or are these a one time thing that will only be available at auction 
  - One time thing . They re only wearing them once then auctioning them off . Pretty sure after this season the fisherman will disappear again unless it was insanely profitable .
- - The market is taking this Bitstamp issue extremely well .
  - Well it s bad news but the price only goes down on good news .
- - I m mainly just looking for one to use for viewing the waveforms coming from my synth when I m designing patches ; a learning tool  if you will .
  - Yep  literally anything would do . EVen a software scope on your favorite DAW
- - I did nt know it was Coheed day 
  - Dude . It is ALWAYS Coheed day .
- - Ahhh  nothing like some immersion-breaking lens flare .
  - I personally do nt think it does break immersion but that s just me i suppose
- - I like how they did details like bleaching the pants .
  - It looked like the shorts were just the white  silky material  instead of the gray shorts the white guy had on .
- - Is that a front sight tool on the keyring 
  - Haha good eye . I never seemed to have one when I needed it so I threw it on the key chain .
- - But  we do nt say street lights are free . Free is the wrong word to describe this tax paid service that is provided .
  - It s free for the illegals in this country is nt it  The street lamp that is
- - Yes . I m pretty detached from my family though  always have been .
  - But you have a new one . I call my in laws mom and dad
- - Heather Cox says Jameis shook everyone on the offense .
  - I hope he washed before he switched between them all .
- - Yeah  it s really more of a strange sentence to be saying than one that makes no sense without context .
  - Yeah  maybe this is better as a TIL .
- - I broke up with my possessive ex and got with this awesome man that never even got me a tiny bit jealous . Trust is everything .
  - Your ex made you jealous  What are the differences in their behaviour with you 
- - Do nt be a jerk . That s not lovely at all .
  - He commented  on a malicious comic .
  - Nobody here can take a joke . Grow up .
  - Do nt be a jerk . That s not lovely at all .
- - Damn  I always used to doubt these dudes  thinking there was no way these dudes could really compete nowadays . Wilt would be a BEAST in today s NBA .
  - With modern training regimen and sports medicine  He could be unstoppable .
- - I saw the video late last night . It looks great 
  - Oh boy  I forgot people are actually subscribed to that lol Thanks 
- - I actually usually hate that argument  and the only reason I made it was because the guy was being a pretty big dick when people disagreed .
  - Oh  I did nt read any other comments
- - How do you know if you get it 
  - there is special music and glitter flies from your CD drive and then it appears . nothing  because you were chat restricted
- - We ll see how wanted he feels after he throws up some ridiculous fade away garbage shots that have no chance of going in while he and Russ watch ...
  - Have you been watching Reggie at all  That s basically what he s been doing  and he looks like he s getting more play time than Westbrook .
  - Reggie and Dion playing together is going to be a headache for Thunder fans .
  - There s only one ball  how bad can it be 
- - You wipe it up with your brother  I see how that could work .
  - I ll leave it . His shirts .
- - Unintentionally hilarious  though . It s like the Zeno s Paradox of intelligence .
  - I had nt heard of zeno s paradox . I like it 
- - Am I the only one who kind of likes the Padres Camo uniform  Lol
  - No . They sell the most out of all the current Padres unis .
- - Grab the cold cuts  Let s get em outside 
  - GON NA GET SOME COLD CUTS  Whooo
- - I ll say as I please regardless of your opinion on the matter .
  - I m sure you will . Does nt make it okay .
- - You know how hard it would be to date Gail and be entertaining or interesting  Just saying
  - I can pretend to have autism at the drop of a hat . Baby girl is gon na be stuck with me for life .
- - There are apps for iPad that do it wired or wireless . No idea about android but maybe .
  - That s cool  did nt know about that . I ll look for an android app  unless I can find that app on iPhone
- - By this point  OP has lost about twice as much comment karma as link karma he has gained . Bravo .
  - You either die with karma  or comment long enough to loose it all .
- - Yes  piss in a bottle is fantastic . Seriously  American beer is terrible and weak .
  - If you re judging American beer off of Coors Light and that stuff then yeah . Other than that America is having a craft beer renaissance .
- - I honestly never used such a method . If your speed is right  you got red and white  why further complicate it .
  - You realize that some places do nt have lights right 
- - I m not going to say the game was fixed  but Cowboys v Packers in the Playoffs will make a lot more money then Lions v Seahawks .
  - They would have been smart to put in on a better time
- - Congrats  That was a huge moment for me as well . So satisfying .
  - Yeah  Remember when Khaos was the highest rank .
  - Haha I remember when Almighty was the highest rank . But yeah  now we must become Skywalkers .
  - I think that will take around two years now that the ABP trick is gone . Still I want my own Shiny Anklet and I will get it 
- - It s not finished . A lot of the rewards are still in progress .
  - Thanks mate . I understand  was just curious .
- - Love the adults on board sticker  Where did you get it 
  - Made it . Always cheaper to make stickers
- - It sounds deep  and complex . I guess it must be really rewarding writing like that
  - I d like to think it is  but I m not an experienced writer . I do nt know  it s fun though  occupies a lot of time .
- - Hmm  I was keeping up with this conversation as long as we stuck to ships and tugs . Lol .
  - Newcastle foreshore . Took great delight in watching tugs bring cargo ships into the port . They do it with such ease . Newcastle is great for ship spotting .
- - But he said mid Atlantic . Pretty sure that s not one of the higher cola places
  - Washington  DC and Manhattan are both very expensive .
- - Is this a parody video  I ca nt tell  I ve seen some delusional fatties  but I do nt believe this .
  - Berta Lovejoy is a parody account that s been floating around fatty vids for a while now . It s a trolling anon .
- - either one works as long as its unaware . what would you like for it 
  - darkrai please . I can give you both . if you need me to clone  change nature  ivs  evs  I can do it for you .
- - not me  but my roommate brings his guitar with him every time he s using the toilet .
  - I bet his playing is pretty shitty .
- - Holy shit ... I m totally going to go there now
  - I m pretty sure there is one in San Francisco if you live by there
- - How much does it weigh  Those coins look like it would make it heavy  I really love it 
  - It actually weights a bit more  feels more solid without feeling like a heavy thing .
- - Caricature  That irony is strong in your post .
  - I do nt get it . The comment I responded to is completely absurd .
- - Exactly  this guy gets it  thank you .
  - Yep you re getting down voted to hell  some people just do nt like it when you go against the norm .
- - Hang in there bro  be strong . You deserve better than someone who sends you snapchats of her with other guys .
  - Thanks  It s nice to see that someone read through it 
- - Now THAT s commitment  Might wan na consider spreading out your consumption of said find  though .
  - Haha  Yes . I was psyched though .
- - Nickel Creek  They make excellent music of the bluegrass persuasion .
  - Nickel Creek is amazing  The Lighthouse s Tale is one of my favorite songs .
- - The worst part of that is that fat fuck gets the hot chick and I get my right hand
  - Totally not your attitude chasing people away now  is it 
- - Is Rabia pissed that Adnan will never love her the way he loved Hae 
  - She should be happy he ll never love her to that extreme 
- - The Assassin s Creed games have a great story and some of them are on sale on steam now .
  - Played all the assasins creeds accept unity .
- - You dont own the Freelo Scout  omg  This disgusts me .
  - Where  I cant see anybody ... Maybe they have satanic powers of stealth
