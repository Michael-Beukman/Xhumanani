  - I m here staying for free so I do nt really have to worry . Finishing my last semester of my senior year in highschool
- - Many an umpire ended up with Cum in his face after a bad call .
  - That guy could really cover ground in the field . Every runner had Cum on em  Cum in the infield  outfield  everywhere  Cum .
- - Heroine looks so great on youuuuu oh my gosh . I need a good purple .
  - heroine is sooooo pretty  I think it looks good on everyone  ive not see anyone ever look bad in it  it s just not possible 
- - Lots of bad puck moving decisions by the Bruins tonight
  - I ll be having flashbacks of that Hammy pass in their zone for a while I think .
- - Does nt he sell his clothes through OpTic and MLG 
  - He sells his clothes to optic and mlg who sell them . It s like nike and Adidas selling shoes to footlocker and footlocker selling them to consumers .
- - If there s anything this summer  for sure . I m worried the time commitment might interfere with my college work .
  - You could always try and find a sub spot on a team  but real life does have to come first

  - Normally I agree  but this is getting to be egregious .
- - Bloody hell . Whenever I play red arse  most of the time people miss . Harder than it looks .
  - I never knew that this was the name of that game .
  - It probably changes from place to place .
  - I did nt even know that it was a famous game  I thought that my friends and I invented it .
- - Janus ca nt rotate anymore when with his ult  can he  Is nt he limited to one direction once it starts charging 
  - No  he can still rotate when charging .

  - Oh okay thanks  Has nt worked for me yet but I ll try again later  before opening it up .
- - My resolution is to try to stop slagging free staters
  - As a Free Stater  all you can do is try ...
- - Explanation read  sense still not made . Search continues .
  - Nonsense  clearly they re just saving water for when they really need it .
- - No way you should  man you are cute . I am sure your personality is the same .
  - I do have a light hearted attitude 
- - Mario Party is developed by a third party studio  so they probably do nt care that much . Heh . Mario Third Party .
  - But it s still a Nintendo product that they ultimately have control over . So that does nt explain much .
- - What a nasty piece of work . I m sorry you have to work with such a harpy .
  - It s ok. at the end of the day I m the one having the kid .
- - I put THC infused  unrefined  coconut oil in my coffee every morning .
  - That sounds amazing . I do the coconut oil  but have nt tried it infused with THC .
- - Whoa  my hometown in the NYT  This is an interesting look at Tent City .
  - Right  That s how I felt .
- - To be honest  I expected a link to an empty webpage .
  - I was definitely expecting a joke as well 
- - Did the manga continue where the anime left off for Deadman Wonderland 
  - No  the anime deviated from the manga and stopped following it at some point . I read the whole manga a while ago  I definitely recommend it
- - They should of put in an Eat More Bar . Those are my JAM 
  - I love eat more . I wish they still had caramel eat more .

- - There s gon na be a brawl soon  I guarantee it .
  - I think it ll be centered around Brown too .
- - What is so funny  Just because you deleted your post does nt mean your warning had been rescinded .
  - It would be his second ban so I imagine he understands the rules .
- - You re lucky that you re not from a very conservative Pentecostal family . That sleep talking episode would have been seen as evidence of demon possession .
  - You re not even wrong and I hate that .
- - The camera panned the audience and a few folks were wearing hospital masks ... can you catch Ebola at a wrestling show  If so I am returning my Smackdown tickets ...
  - People in Japan wear mask when they have the cold . Its a cultural thing .
- - The problem with this is that scouts can not be built after Scientific Theory wich lots of people prefer to get before Dynamite .
  - That s okay  posting about this realization here has led to the revelation that I can use spies instead 
- - So Nino s number one ... I am speechless right now .
  - So now you can stop bitching about how underrated she is . Apparently she is adequately rated .
- - That looks sketchy . No image or description .
  - It s legit . The ISBN s match exactly . Its just too new an entry to have the box cover posted .
- - I think she s legit  just one that missed some QC maybe with the underside .
  - That s a relief . I feel kind of bad though  as Amazon already gave me a refund .
- - Mostly bacon  sausage  toast and many other things . I like to substitute the beans though with grits . It s my American twist on it 
  - Canadian  Grits arent huge here but i m going to half to try them now
  - Add some cheese to them and they become amazing .
  - I have to disagree . Butter and sugar for a sweet bowl of diabetes .
- - No  we can not tell you what substance that is just by looking at a picture of it on the internet  and attempting to do so would be irresponsible .
  - Alrighty . I ll just continue to be completely ignorant on the matter .
- - FINALLY some vegetarian food on this sub .
  - I m always steeling recipes in this sub .
- - It s a an example of a group of women praising gold digging .
  - And there are groups of men praising misogyny and nobody in his sane mind would use them to say that men hate women . That s ridiculous .

- - My parents got me one of these for christmas this year . Its a cool piece
  - Wow  Really  I wonder how many are out there  I would like to know how they were originally marketed

  - I m always envious of the people who have caught shinies in the first few gens haha  seems a lot more elusive than now .
- - Is that a temp monitor  I have never seen such a thing O.o
  - It s the NZXT Source . As well as monitoring temps  it s a touch screen five way fan controller .
- - If you look even closer  you ll see me being an idiot and making the above comment .
  - Ah  my mistake . Sarcasm is hard to decipher over the internet where an abundance of serious inquiries are made .
  - I was nt being sarcastic  I was being dumb .
  - Like I said  I m very bad at distinguishing inflection over the internet .
- - I bet you this was months in planning . That s time taken away from the atrocious launch of Unity . Ubi does not have their priorities straight .
  - While you are nt wrong  I doubt the developers behind a video game helped make toy bricks .
- - You do nt understand finances  do you  If you can make the payment but struggle to do so  that is a bad thing 
  - It s better than failing to do so 
- - Oh ok  I reread your first comment and now it makes sense . Thanks for reformatting .
  - My fault  it was poorly formatted . I did nt realize that . Not a problem  Thanks for pointing it out .
- - Sounds really fun to me . Maybe try it with cards against humanity next time with another couple 
  - People might drop dead of alcohol poisoning lol .
- - you wo nt be saying that when Gasol  Butler  Leonard  and Love sign with them
  - Why would they sign Leonard if they already have LeBron 
- - I do nt think the wardens outside of Orlais were affected by Cory  so there really is nt a reason to attack them .
  - theres a civil war going on with the wardens being led by either hawke or the three wardens .
- - Huh  I ll give it a go if I m ever around a giant tire and sledgehammer .
  - they have these at my gym too but i ve never been game to try it
- - Ahhh ... clicked on this because I thought it said extra long horses 
  - dont get me started on the extra long horses
- - I have a scorp fit you d probably love to try
  - youd probably be right . i dont fly them often but im open
- - Yup  that s pretty much how I remember taking notes when I had math classes .
  - I tuned in for plot . That was all .
- - I think you look quite a bit better now than the ladies in those pictures  If you are not sure though  maybe try a chin length bob first .
  - Thanks  I will think about it .
- - stop spamming this thread  you hambeast . you already have another thread up where you got destroyed  with the exact same text
  - you obviously did nt read my bottom disclaimer .
- - You could have made someone a very happy person by pressing bid lol . Got ta love these kinds of glitches
  - I was thinking about trying it but I didnt want to risk losing anything
- - You need help with any woodworking projects 
  - I would like to start working on some and learning but I do nt know where to begin
- - Just wondering if you ve seen the map of current pipeline over the very same aquifer 
  - And that is a good reason to build more  With this logic we would still have asbestos in our buildings and lead paint on our walls .
- - I enjoyed the joke thoroughly  but feel as if I lost IQ points reading the other comments .
  - Some people in the comments do nt have IQ points to lose ...
- - Can someone also post what happened at the game today 
  - Tim gave her the flowers and they re standing together .
- - Anybody else notice how the Cowboys  line is holding on almost every single play as well  Just like they have all season 
  - Just like every offensive line in the league 
- - He should have done did  what they done did said then .
  - Your fancy words make my brain sore .
- - LOVE THIS  He met the Doctor last year  and he left them their own sonic screwdrivers when he drove St. Nicolas around last December 
  - That sounds fantastic  Lol . I m jealous of your child . I would love to meet The Doctor .
- - Bernie is dominating this sub right now and it is awesome .
  - Do nt make the mistake of believing this sub mirrors public perception or belief to any degree .
- - I wonder if this new trigger is an effort to reduce the long trigger pull 
  - I could only assume so since that was probably the biggest complaint about the original . The gun shoots very smooth otherwise .
- - Looks good but has maybe the most annoying voice on the planet .
  - It probably sounds better when she is moaning
- - Did nt the podcast mention that according to the prosecutors  no deal was ever offered 
  - Yes  but she also never pursued one . With a guilty client  I would expect a defense attorney to pursue one .
- - Wow these three people are immensely unfunny ... could nt last a whole minute .
  - Adam Hunter comedy itself is nt that bad  but his MMA stuff is just brutal .
- - If it makes you feel any better  you ve given me a legit belly laugh on a shitty day .
  - For that  I am happy . I also fixed that meme  and gave you props .
- - Damn . It seems like a lost cause . Thanks everyone .
  - Was there a particular set you had in mind  Depending on how old it is it might be still be on shelves in a physical store .

- - Do nt make me hump chase you too . I ll do it 
  - You ll have to find me first 
- - Oh so much worse . What will I do with my spare time now     
  - Imagine what you ll save on moisturizer .
- - So  if he had a economics degree  with emphasis in currency markets from Montana State University  then you would be satisfied 
  - WTF  Montana State  Every degree they give out is a degree in beer pong and weed .
- - I think that Xeon motherboards are expensive  so tell me what happens to you .
  - Yeah ... They use the same socket .
- - New years resolution for YOU should be to re evaluate your friendship  the same way she should re evaluate her relationship .
  - Yep ... I really do nt like doing it because I really see a lot of myself in her when I was her age ...
- - Im honestly impressed by how well it went despite the lack .
  - Probably because everyone in the world has some sad stuff to get off their chests .
- - Which really pissed me off  because the actual main character was horribly written and acted .
  - Sorry that a CGI dinosaur did nt act well
  - He was fat too  It s like he did no preparations for the movie .
  - He had just gotten off painkillers and was nt really prepared to go back to work but had to or else break the contract .
- - There will probably be a seed . Something akin to Binding of Isaac .
  - they said that you would be able to share them in some way  like a level share system
- - Depends on their background  though . Even in the US our society still has some gaps in terms of contraception being available  convenient  cheap  and reliable .
  - As far as cheap  it s always cheaper to not have kids than to have them .
- - Aww that s cute . She did a great job . I bet she ll have fun picking out fabrics . I could stay in a fabric store forever .
  - Thanks  she had a BLAST running around holding up different bolts to find the perfect ones 
- - Mine is still in the mop shrine since war spear does nt have portals to everywhere  and my garrison has a portal there anyway .
  - Stormwind and Orgrimmar have portals to ashran too .
  - Directly to Ashran  Or just to blasted lands  I could nt find the portal in Orgrimmar  only to blasted lands
  - its in the hold where voljin is .
- - Leonard Part Six . Also  Alive .
  - I m starting a petition to get Leonard Part Six Part Two made .
- - That looks great . How d you cook it 
  - Gordan Ramsay s how to cook the perfect steak 
- - I have nt eaten anything ; - ;
  - Got ta eat if you want those gainz
- - BCAAs and creatine to start out with  assuming your diet and sleep are in order first
  - BCAAs are good for fasted workouts or post-workout if you re doing TKD  but otherwise ... why 
- - Shoot one bullet  pause then pump the rest in and see if you do nt get tried for murder
  - OH  you meant prolonged pause in between shots . I thought you meant prolonged pause after the guy points his gun at the perp .
- - Spurs are a lot of foreign club s favourite English team eg Ajax and Barcelona fans do often like Spurs .
  - Probably because there s never the risk of them being conflicted should they meet in the Champions League .
- - Why would you taunt in a game like this  WTF dude .
  - Well he goes to alabama cant be that smart
- - Bro  it s just wrestling . Come here  give me a hug .
  - k  fine . . . . hugs laptop . . . You hugged yours  too  right 
- - I do nt get it ca nt you see your hp without holding tab 
  - He means on the map where theres a picture of a heart saying theres on in there ...
- - Busted . Multiple times . i still like the guy
  - I agree . He got busted  yea  but that does nt make him any worse of a person than the guys who have nt been caught yet .
- - I bet you re fun at parties .
  - False . He s not invited to them .
- - Seriously  That s awful . I m so sorry that your boss is an idiot .
  - Yeah . She s kinda a control freak like that .
- - This better than GA on vayne  Seems like it would work best with corki or ez but not vayne .
  - By the time vayne has respawned with her GA rengar s abilities have cooled down and he is just going to annihilate her again .
- - He was supposed to tell an actual joke  but he could nt remember it  so he made up the snake nonsense . The joke does nt actually exist .
  - I was talking about the joke in The Breakfast Club .
- - Those pubes took some time and effort .
  - yeah i m sure they did . at least the cops hat a laugh before they actually had to call their superiors to ask if it has to be destroyed or not
  - What was the reason  Unsanctioned art 
  - i have no idea . maybe they felt threatened in their manhood or something . also we germans hate fun 
- - Was it a Korean or an expat 
  - Koreans here are generally non-violent . They almost never go beyond yelling . Korean americans from California on the other hand tend to be fkn nuts .
- - That s what you get for playing crap .
  - Hey that s a pretty big insult ... to crap
- - What  Those are nt necessarily the same thing ...
  - I did nt say they were . I m saying lots of people in long distance relationships who met online have nt met each other after six months .
  - Most people think that s weird . Especially if you have nt seen their face .
  - They re allowed to think it s weird .
- - You could just rip out the insoles and get some nice ones in there since you are walking so far in them
  - I just attempted to glue them back down  but I think I ll probably just rip the fuckers out if this does nt work .
- - As some one who is in college now my pile of programs I do outside of class because I enjoy programming is how I hope to get jobs
  - And that is how you WILL get jobs .
- - I do nt pay for heat or water . This advice is meaningless to apartment dwellers . P
  - wow where do you live  Ive always paid for heat in my apts  and normally always pay water too .
