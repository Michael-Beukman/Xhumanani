  - Fair warning I ran out of feed . You re inheriting a rabid beast .
- - You managed to get people who are nt just looking to talk to a girl   I m impressed
  - Oh trust me  this is a fraction of all the conversations . Most just said crude things and disconnected .
- - Hahaha nice . Not as useful  but much cooler .
