  - No  the other dude did but I caught that as well . Would have sucked for them

  - I hate so much the things that he chooses to be .
- - infinite pooper  the new marvel hero 
  - I ve been drinking cider all weekend . I think I have that power

- - I put mayonnaise in vanilla pudding cups and eat it in public places .
  - Lets be real  neither of these two things have ever happened
- - The things she said indicated she was a Nazi sympathizer .
  - ah  well then it was perfectly reasonable to never speak to her again of your own volition .
- - I think it s all the startups in silicon valley making cool shit and getting rich . A lot of people want that life .

- - There s lots of nasty sex going on in public restrooms anyway  regardless of the size of stalls or even if stalls are present .
  - You ca nt stop everyone  but I imagine that there are quite a few people who have decided against it due to the big gaps in the door .
- - Why is this an acceptable statement  Get out .
  - So I have to be politically correct on the internet  got it . Simply describing the person as I see him .
- - so was the groom the guy who pick pockets him 
  - Yeah pretty sure  after he received the message on his phone .
- - Good video  I feel bad for how that fella  fumbles his words though .
  - Pretty sure english is his second language .

- - That would make for a great anniversary game to be honest . Also it could help introduce new fans of the series to older characters . Everybody wins 
  - Awakening kinda did that but those models just being variations of MU killed it for me . The only one worth getting is Marth . Edit . words
- - I like you  but im not like IN like with you ...
  - I WANT TO DO A SEX UPON YOU
- - Check government stats I posted this a while back All sourced from DOC  FBI  and census

  - Because TCU students buy higher quality products .
- - That s pretty much meat every movie that butchers physics . I was a nightmare at Interstellar
  - Interstellar was so much fun because neither science nor plot made any sense but it was still beautiful .

  - I thought you were legitimately asking whether or not it was . I need some sleep ...
  - It happens . D Go to bed .
- - Third time Rusev vs Reigns Main Evented Smack Down  all three times it ended in a DQ

  - Oh my god  it s not Putin  we know you re just trying to defame him . p
- - If you kill a unit bitten by a big spider with broods first spell will it still spawn the small spider 
  - Broods first spell is a debuff . If anything kills the unit while the debuff is active it will spawn spiderlings .
- - i never even knew PPVs had a time limit . for what  theres nothing on this channel after the fight
  - You only get as long as you pay for
- - Wear them to work . If you re worried about ruining them  then buy an inexpensive beater pair .

  - I know . But it s quite hilarious  that the police advise you to use shrill alarms .
- - If you hover over where it says radiant energies on the weapon s tree it actually says it should drop from Nightfalls in lesser quantities . Please explain this .

  - I wish the gun was never invented and people would have to duke it out in sword fights all the time . Much less blood would be spilled .
- - Am I the only one that does nt care for Clover  The food is medicore and they are nt very friendly .
  - The food is decent  IMO  but they take way too long to serve .
- - Manaphy is full on legendary  due to it being impossible to legitimately make more Manaphy . Phione is nt legendary  and Rotom was meant to be legendary .
  - Rotom was breedable even back in DPPt . If it was originally legendary it would have been in the Undiscovered egg group then .
- - Those melo s are beautiful . How much you cop for 
  - All three I copped for retail the Melos from footaction  black gums from champs  and the grapes from ebay .

  - I honestly would like this to happen . We need to ship off a few pieces to make it a reality  though . Andy  for instance .
- - Dumb ass Americans who think that just because they HELPED defeat the Nazis  that means they can say whatever they want .
  - It came from the UK . You do nt know about the big UK France rivalry they ve always had  Also you seem to know nothing about WWII .
- - Oh  no  Uniqlo is nice cheap . But they do have free hemming .
  - That s amazing . I hope that does catch on in the States .

- - No communism any more  just people living their lives . That s where the treasure is buried .
  - As previously stated . What is the treasure 
  - It s in cuba  want something more  come get me .
  - Do you wish to die  Cause I dont think that if they catch you  you re gon na live long . Humor me with a hint .
- - Use vocaroo  all those do dos tell us nothing .

  - Thank you for the suggestion  I ll check it out

  - did nt know that . thank you 
- - Says a guy who probably never played a fucking sport in his life .
  - I know that dork is nt calling another dork a dork ...

  - Do nt worry  my next project will be micro rc cars with pins and balloons attached to the back
- - Watched my dad play Silent Hill . It and the walking dead game are my favorites .
  - I remember playing Silent Hill years ago and absolutely shitting my pants  still ca nt play a horror game to this day haha

  - They re live audio  not dubbed .
- - You do nt type with your mouth .
  - But they give you medication that makes you go crazy so it wo nt hurt
- - added you . could you please add me back and go online  need golurk . thanks
  - Added  and I m online in afternoons and evenings of EST .
- - FUCK THE QUEUE SYSTEM  HOW AM i SUPPOSE TO GET THAT FUCKING SPHERE FROG IF IT DOES NOT LET ME ENTER  FUCK THE SERVER  FUCK GIMU 
  - Well you are out of luck with the sphere frog anyways . You ca nt get it unless you plan on handing Gumi your soul and wallet .
- - Someone s either high or hungover . Since the latter is true for me  I m gon na go for it . EDIT . FUCK  no pickles
  - Welp looks like you re just gon na have to eat the entire brick of cream cheese
- - I just realized this morning that I m being led on . I said fuck it  I m not going to let her have that satisfaction .

- - Shower and tell myself I will buy myself a fancy coffee drink after .
  - Haha I do the same thing  I moved across down but go to the same gyno since her office is right next to an amazing coffee shop .
- - I wish the jacket was black so badly  shoes look nice though
  - Black would make it uninteresting  the dark red makes it more appealing
- - I m available now  you  For the other eggs please make a request on the needed TSV Thread .
  - Yes I m available now . I ll make a post on the needed tsvs then .
- - Ooo shiny . They all look so pretty 
  - You could say their Kira Kira is a Happy Maker why did I say that 
- - A nigga would sink to the bottom like Jack . Eyes wide open too like why the fuck did I listen to these white people .
  - HAHAHAHA Man  I do nt know why this comment is nt right on top .
- - Henson  Patterson  Landry  Jerebko  Marcus Morris  Jason Smith or Jason Thompson as a punt at PF 
  - Hmm not sure  can you give me a few more options 
  - okay  I m slow . you re implying none are worthy of a punt 
  - Thats alot of options and some of them are as good of a chance as the next .
- - Valencia on top of their game today ... Real  eh  not so much . So many chances wasted . . x
  - Valencia has been great  us on the other hand ...
- - They are the size of the larger stations
  - Yeah  docking something that size onto anything smaller than a moon would be pretty pointless . It would make way more sense to take a shuttle over .
- - Couldve made it black and blue instead  I just do nt like green tshirts that much
  - There s also a white  blue  and white hoodie version if you click the drop down menu .
- - Really because I m a product of that system and I knew you were talking out your ass . Maybe it s you .
  - Oh i m sure you re not ... not in the public schools ... because your elitist  snobbish  coddled entitlement issues show right through your words .
- - Why is it hard to ignore a cartoon  Why is it some kind of achievement if you do 
  - Because the Extremists basically will threaten to kill everyone that offends them .
- - I went to check if any friends were online and in between the normal messages while my friend list loaded this popped up .
  - Looks like someone forgot to delete some placeholders when editing the Help Popups .
- - A created being is NEVER Truly Free .
  - We are alone . You are not being watched by an invisible magic god .
- - I need an app to mute Collinsworth .
  - I you have surround sound turn off your middle speakers

  - I m not really sure  but I think they ve been around longer than Mickey D s ...
- - Is it just me or does Kane s voice not really fit to his body 
  - Meh  looks about right to me . He always sounds so phlegmy though .
- - What organization are you doing this with  I m studying to become an RD  I would love to do this .
  - The organization is called Abide Family Center . It ll just be me for a while . But once we get a program established I want to see about interns .
- - I love how at the end  they round the corner holding hands .
  - I think they d make a cute couple  and I like how they used the principal s discomfort with seeing them touch against him .

- - with all the calls i make i m bound to get one right sooner or later 
  - Not a closer  but close enough .
- - I love this kind of MacGyver  practical science stuff . I ca nt wait to show my little boy this later 
  - Then you ll hate it a week later when your standing in front of your house  burnt to the ground .

- - I would consider that a light user .
  - smoke at least an eighth a day .
- - He s not about to poop is he  I ve known some dogs to poop on furniture when they re unhappy ...
  - No  no pooping . I hope . She just sits like that until you give her what she wants or she gets bored .

  - Too fat and unfit to swim due to the electronics we own nowadays .
- - I do nt know what first game you re talking about . I mean a bigger game than the average game .

  - Good to know  I ll give them a play-through while I can .
- - So you think I should stay away from mesh 
  - Depends what weather you ride in . Leather only keeps out light showers . A textile jacket with a goretex lining is a must if you deal with rain .
- - aw shit he s gon na win by headkick
