  - Yeah  I never liked collars  always felt like I d just bump into the taps . I live in a small place

  - Or at least ask everyone else to leave the room first .

  - Or guys prone to playing video games in front of new girls .
- - Usually these scenarios are just people selling to their own bots . Idk why this would be any different .
  - That s when the price is ridiculously higher  not lower .
- - They are called Gyrm Gauntlets . The other ones are called Gyrm Warrior Gauntlets .
  - Yeah do nt have them sorry dude . Is there anything else you re looking for 
- - haha think we have all been there done that . Worst for me was having a shower  got out of the shower and realised i forgot the damn towel 
  - Oh no  But yes OP no time like the present to take a spare pair of socks and underwear in .
