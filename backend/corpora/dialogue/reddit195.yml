  - Why would you call someone gay if you did nt think they were gay 
  - Because you want to insult them and you knew they would feel insulted if you called them gay is one reason .
  - That makes zero sense . Think before you reply .
- - I ll change my oil but tires and brakes  I m out on that .
  - I changed brakes once and that was enough lol

- - They should ve posted a picture of Kevin Dyson being one yard short .
  - I feel like that s just spiteful as opposed to a light-hearted jest .
- - Is Rickie Lambert s mom filming this from the stands 
  - Quite possibly the worst camera angle all season

  - That s only one of the many fine things that I ask for . And a nice butt .
- - Is that a current picture of Ragen with that thank you card  My goodness ...
  - It s actually her book  but she seems to have used MS paint to turn it into a thank you card .
- - Honestly the amount of customization in the system is at once it s greatest strength  and the biggest cause of problems as well .
  - it attracts nerds  and summarily destroys them ... BRILLIANT 
- - Right . And the rule specifies if a player on the field removes his helmet to argue with an official . Reading is hard  I know .
  - His helmet was never on thus no removing happened .
- - What if your sibling sees this and does it to mess with you 
  - At that point I d just be impressed with that kind of long con .

- - Do SD channels work  Also  maybe a dumb question  but you can view channels on WMC on the server  right 
  - Yes to the second part  it works on the wmc server side
- - Relying solely on energy income and not bothering to build educational and physical infrastructure sounds like a fantastic way to become present-day Russia .
  - I guess that explains the population shift to Texas 
- - Plug and play consoles cost more than a pound

  - I think you may have just found the cure for cancer .
- - Except Zed wo nt be in the right hands in silver ...
  - Eh  I feel like I m a pretty solid Zed . I average pretty good scores so you know . Just takes practice .
- - He s the second most dangerous dragon by proximity after Zhaitan . The entire norn Personal Story deals with his minions getting too close . P .
  - His minions are not him . After pushing the races south to where they are now he retreated to the north . We have absolutely no idea where he is .
  - Zhaitan never left Orr either  and Jormag s minions keep coming south against the norn and the kodan .
  - Zhaitan never left Or because it contained the greatest collection of magical artifacts in a single location . Why would he leave 
- - They re great for working up to full bw chins and dips . Started with them myself . Keep up the work 
  - Most people suggest negatives as being far more effective to getting to a full bw chin up .
- - Who the hell wears a cup for football 
  - Everyone who plans on having children later on in life .

- - Kings wont get a luckier win all season
  - Pushing the play the whole game is nt a lucky win . That s a hard working  grind it out win .
- - Was nt that sponsored by Marty Mcfly 
  - I thought Willard Peters already did that . But maybe Tommy Gillespie did it too .
- - well  religion is nt about logic so it s all good
  - Yeah  why use logic when you can be told what to believe

- - I got ta be honest  I cringed the most when the kid started talking about being a slow fucker .
  - At that point  I think he was saying anything that he hoped might mellow them out a bit .
- - I would nt worry about that too much here . Non members that come into this sub just to troll are promptly banned and the offending comments deleted
  - My ban hammer is heavy and efficient with trolls .
- - the visa gift cards have never worked as far as I know . It s mastercard and amex fixed values
  - Yup I ve only had success with MasterCard and Amex too . I ve done Amex lately just because of no service fee
- - My mother always says he was great for the old people  improved their standard of living and because of that they kept voting for him .
  - Old people love him because of the free travel
- - The colors on your shirt match the background too much . Wear darker clothing  and is the camera confusing you or is your head heavy 
  - Well that was a test picture I plan on taking the pic with a black vneck tee or a sweater or something
- - Zelda is the princess . Link is the guy who always saves her ass
  - thank you i had them confused i thought link and zelda were the same person
- - Pitchforks can be thrown like javelins but I do nt think that s what it means .
  - Maybe you re on the right track .
- - So many people get a wild hair up their ass about it . Do nt really understand why .
  - It s because they are pretentious douche bags . Apparently this bit of news was nt important enough for this one .
- - Someone told me they put a tennis ball in with the food to slow down their pup .
  - Interesting  but Lilly would probably eat that too . LOL .
- - then do nt play him ap you fucking nerd

- - I m still in high school up in Danvers MA
  - I feel you man . Beverly here .
- - A disintegration performed by a bounty hunter .
  - We saw this in A New Hope  ay least after it happened .
  - I m not sure you understand the difference between burning a body and disintegration ...
  - Also I m pretty sure they were killed by Stormtroopers  not bounty hunters .
- - Why do people not know how Elder titans ULT work    
  - Because they do nt bother with reading the description and do not play the hero enough themselves .
- - Because the investment class produces little  yet reap most of the rewards from production . I think he thought he was doing something for the working class  somehow .
  - Yes  because only producers of physical goods add value to the economy .
- - Damn  never heard of this song . Dope song all the way around
  - Check out the album if you have nt  it s great .
- - You do nt see Good Morning often  nice stuff .
  - It was a blind buy for me  I was pleasantly surprised by it . A little gem of a film for sure .

- - I m pretty sure they d use that money for something else ... like ... making a new shitty ad .
  - Just like game of war and Kate upton commercial .

  - I did the exact same thing  I never noticed how the context between them sounded

  - Near Baltimore  and I work near DC . Dirty south enough  I think
- - Claims to be a redneck Is making margaritas
  - Margaritas are actually a very redneck thing  ironically . I m not sure how it came to be that way  but definitely so .
- - I do nt know what those are  and now that I see where this is going  I never will . Ha

  - They were too concerned about safety to worry about those details .
- - you are confused . every buff has been in beta . there have been none post release
  - You re right  I will edit my post .
- - That s interesting . I thought tea tree oil was actually supposed to combat acne .

  - Eh  maybe I m just a fan of bad lip synching or something . Haha
- - Ah  true  I had nt considered the batteries being submerged but the rest of the ship dry .

  - I can try and make a video of it if you want

- - Lets see some teal pinstripes on that home jersey 
  - I ll see if I still have the templates for these ... but realistically  the clean look is part of the appeal of the current jerseys .
- - at least she only attacked the monitors and not the tower .
  - I think she did attack it  but it survived .
- - Which MODO ca nt even figure out .
  - To be fair  it s only the sample hand generator that s broken . But still .

  - Really bad . This is more of a popularity contest .
- - How do I deward high ground ward as a melee support 
  - Same as with ranged supports only you have to be closer . Blink or forcestaff onto the high ground .
