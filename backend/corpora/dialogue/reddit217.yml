  - I do this with glasses or mugs before I put anything in them . No idea why or how it started .
- - It was me trolling . I could nt give a fuck . See all in good fun  just having a wind up . All fun in the sun eh
  - Rightio . Fair enough . Play on .
- - Has anyone let the city know they have invented sod 
  - Sod is a lot more expensive than seed and results in ultimately shittier lawn . But of course the turf experts at the Parks dept already know that .
- - I really fancy a quiet pint but everyone I know is having a go at dry January . Sigh .
  - I do nt drink enough per month to warrant a dry January any more
- - Does Noel start at PF with Sims at C hinder Covington s mins tonight  IDK if this is the usual lineup for PHI
  - Seems like Covington is not starting  if twitter is to be believed .
- - Well funded research ... make sure rich people do nt buy them ... Who do you think funds most research 
  - The taxpayers actually fund most of it  believe it or not .
- - It looked like they were running from a tsunami because that s exactly what they were doing .
  - That one piece of my argument is incorrect but does nt negate everything else that was said .
- - This is such a sloppy game . Flags everywhere .
  - It is wet and foggy there  play is getting sloppy and teams are getting desperate .
- - Is nt it funny how ultimate team is essentially older than Pogba s professional career  and you get to watch him gradually progress year after year .
  - Yes but Ultimate team is an arcade game mode  and is nothing like real football  you can watch him year after year watching Juventus .
- - Where would you rank NDSU in this then 
  - Has NDSU announced they will join the FBS 
- - Maaaan I ca nt decide if I love that game or hate that game .
  - Love that game  hate the tough as nails arcades at the end .
- - Wait  Freddie did nt actually record and produce the whole thing by himself did he 
  - Not only did he do that  he also manufactured the recording equipment with his bare hands and then built the stadiums he performed in . Let s see Satan do that
- - I do nt think anyone cares what comment number you are on xda
  - Haha OK I give up  I ll delete . I ve never been down voted so much before . You guys hurt my feelings .
- - Uhhh ... connection issues . Sorry comrades . It is not an honorable demise .
  - I had total loss and had to leave .
- - I still do nt understand  What is this about 
  - IT S A REFERENCE TO A PODCAST YOU DO NT LISTEN TO .
- - I m just glad Jake got a point
  - Honestly the only thing happening this season that s keeping me from hoping off the ole Ben Franklin is G and Jake having unreal years .
- - And there are still people angry at Disney for ignoring shit like this . Did nt Darth Maul become a crab person 
  - For a while until he got robot legs
- - Our offense has been amazing  but I d like to see just a little bit more from our defense .
  - yes . most of those turnovers were not forced . toronto will probably control the ball better in the second half .
- - Her nipples do nt exist in this photo .
  - Female nipples do nt exist in Kill la Kill .
- - I think people who generalize fanbases have too much time
  - Are you generalizing about people who generalize 
- - No link to the building in question on google maps or any context whatsoever 
  - It s a garbage post that violates the rules too . The OP should be ashamed .
- - How is it a neutral site game if its played in florida 
  - Technically any game not played at the home stadium of a team is neutral site . But yeah  that would be a de facto advantage for FSU .
- - Thank you for this . Made my NYE just that much more enjoyable .
  - Glad to hear it  Thanks for the kind words .
- - I want to see a cartoon of Muhammad sucking Uncle Sam s cock while getting pegged by Lady Liberty  anyone  cause I ca nt draw
  - Or hell  make Uncle Sam the one sucking . Dress him up in leather with a choke collar . That way everyone s sensitivities get stepped on .
- - That is nt a grilled cheese  it s a Monte Cristo  Just kidding . Kind of ...
  - That s not a Monte Cristo  that s my wife  I m so sorry .
- - I would heavily disagree that they are different problems .
  - That s fine  but further discussion about the example would be derailing . It s an example  not the topic of discussion .
- - Why can actual animated hentai be like this ...
  - Japanese law  I m afraid . It sucks .
- - Have you purchased the pa on massdrop 
  - MFLB will no longer be offered on massdrop .
- - It might be that you are in a group with him . Try leaving groups that you do nt really interact with .
  - or report them to the group mods .
- - I wonder if he might have been sitting on the billboard and fallen off
  - and ...  I think if he had fallen off  and that resulted in his death  the autopsy would reveal that .
- - I m confused those are all based off this video though ...
  - Yeah . The original was popular and that s how the vine culture works . Ooooooh kill em 
- - I m excited for our INT s next year with Muschamp .
  - I wo nt miss his offenses but good lord could he put together a defense . You guys got a home run hire with him .
- - I do nt see how they do nt trade Jackson and Lamb . I really do nt understand how they not
  - It s not like there s any interest in them . Jackson is a FA after this season and Lamb has nt proven himself to be of much value yet .
- - Those lyrics are awful are they real  How the hell do people dick ride Q and then shit on Young Thug  Migos  and RHQ 
  - Who is shitting on any of those guys
- - I really like Steve Holland  but can you imagine how disappointed the press must be when Mourinho does nt show up 
  - It s pretty evident when almost all the questions are based on Jose and not the team
- - Immigration may save your country some day .
  - Emigration on the other hand ... Will leave our country empty before that day comes .
- - I see some Brent Weeks there  good taste .
  - Yeah . He s a great writer and a really cool dude .
- - Is it emotionally taxing when you have to take a break from playing to take the horse and wagon up to the old general store 
  - At least he can enjoy the scenery on his way outside to the outhouse to go to the bathroom .
- - forums rock - the usability is a barrier of entry that keeps out the riff raff
  - lol this is the most pretentious thing I ve ever read on mfa
- - malcolm in the house of cards - the boys wreak havoc at freddie s ribs  lois and frank go up against each other in a battle of wits
  - And the family would be banned from yet another tourist attraction .
- - Love it but pics of booze or you ai nt drank 
  - My apologies  I had my normal cheap macro swill at arm s length  however it did nt make it into the picture ...
- - Saying better speaker stands makes you seem like a jerk . I do nt know if you ment to or not .
  - Maybe . But it s the truth .
- - I d like to buy either the same amount of bottles I purchased this year  or less . By no means more .
  - It s gon na have to be a lot less for me this year .
- - show getting shut down . getting stabbed by a random weirdo . other then that taking some bad shit 
  - yeah shows getting shut down would be the worst
- - So just out of curiosity what s with the squares on the bass drum  Btw lovely set .
  - Likely to cover up holes from removing hardware .
- - You ve got to move your save file somewhere else  or delete it . This game has a one save file rule  unfortunately .
  - Really  you ca nt start a new game 
  - Really . Not without moving or deleting your save file  anyway .
  - Yeah  that was quite a dick move from Ubisoft .
- - Seriously yo  sometimes I do nt even know it s happening  sometimes I cry watching a Dick s Sporting Goods commercial .
  - Insurance commercials here . But only about once a year
- - Would white for pearl be ok with you .
  - if you still want to trade  white s yours
- - Do you suppose you could upload it to the Playstore 
  - Umm  I do nt know how to do that and I probably wo nt get to that any time soon . Too busy .
- - Has anyone used a pre-paid credit card or paypal to book a hotel room 
  - I do nt think that works well because of the amount initially reserved . Also most hotel credit card machines are programmed not to accept prepaid cards .
- - Faker s leblanc was so fucking good this game . Also  PENTAKILL .
  - Fakers LB is good every game ever .
- - I thought the benefit of methadone was that you dont build a tolerance to it
  - I am unaware of any narcotic that does not have tolerance .
- - is it me or is ek taking less shots these days 
  - Probably more  imo . All the shots of alcohol for having to play with Phillips probably affects his on-ice shots though .
- - Please read the rules before posting a team thread .
  - sorry did nt know which tag to put in
- - What does an American premium tank have to do with British and German light tank crews  O.O
  - I was so busy at work I thought I was replying to another thread lol I will edit 
- - Can you tell us how  Thanks .
  - Kerrygold grass fed butter . Simmer . Strain . Enjoy .
- - I would like to know more about putting lightbulbs in water . What was the reasoning behind that  Congrats on the novels  very cool .
  - I do nt ever remember doing it  That s the best part .
- - You and your friend had lucky escapes  They preyed on you while you were vulnerable and hurting . Glad you never went too deep .
  - Thanks  yea they were despicable . I try to tell other about the organisation because they do prey on people in times of weakness .
- - I ve played more blitzball than the main game lol
  - I feel like it s a hate it or love it sort of thing lol
- - get it bear arms  ok I ll walk myself out
  - Thank you . Would have never got it .
- - Cant wait to see jerry jones at the end of the game when his offense is nearly shutout . The dallas defense is going to be exhausted in the second half .
  - If they play poorly it could definitely affect Murray s contract
- - Redbird is absolutely worth it if you can get one .
  - I just signed up for serve  should I cancel and get Redbird instead  Sounds like the benefits in MS are much better .
- - Can she just do a straight porno now please .
  - No  she s been retired for over a year . Due to STD scares . She only does solo cam shows now .
- - Just read my posts here  you ll make a killing .
  - Yes I commented on your recent post about an hour ago . You should manage a fund .
- - The first point ... is true for any profession . Why do teachers get a free pass on it 
  - Why do nt other professions  They used to . Teachers have a strong union ... instead of wanting to bring them down why do nt we bring other jobs up 
- - with all the money he has he still has terrible looking tattoos
  - I m surprised he even has them  they HAVE to be fake .
- - is this a laptop or desktop  Also if it is a desktop do you have an alternative card to test with 
  - It is a desktop and no I do nt have an alternate card to test with .
- - apparently the club paid him to make an appearance after the game on monday  since he was promoting it on twitter and IG that he was going to be there .
  - Wait  so they made him come back the next night 
- - So glad your mom got some spunk back  Tell her we are thinking of her .
  - It s working . I am just amazed  What an awesome day . . D
- - I ve tried it for two clients and it was expensive and very ineffective
  - Thanks for the post . I do nt think I ll be doing it .
- - Nice  Knee injuries are dumb . I have one myself  but am running at much tinier weights and it s gotten a lot better .
  - So annoying  but the feeling once you can start getting back under heavy weight ... Hehe 
- - Yet in North America its the reverse . The majority of goods are transported via truck .
  - Trains are also highly efficient in NA - freight rail is significantly more efficient than in Europe
- - Ankles . Wrists are like hand ankles . Elbows are like hand knees .
  - Elbows are arm knees  my friend .
- - I do feel I have the right to criticize your game . Your fault for posting a shit early access .
  - Early access is to test bugs and get legit feedback . Not for jealous fags that are mad because they ca nt do what others can .
- - Gandhi was a wife beater though so it fits in nicely .
  - He would nt let her accept Western medicine so she died  he later accepted it to save his own life .
- - Pantheon and Jayce counter him pretty hard .
  - Anyone with an instant gap close can wreck teemo .
- - Whats up guys and gals . Whats your opinion on muscle pharm protein powder and preworkout 
  - The Combat Isolate tastes gross would not buy again . Assault Pre is not bad but there are better options out there .
- - This is nt an official lego set . A very dedicated fan made this with parts from various different sets .
  - Are you sure Luke Skywalker was nt in the US Navy 
- - What was going on in that picture 
  - A near revolution  that s what was going on 
- - The Three Musketeers  and a blue Triumph Spitfire .
  - ooo  sounds like you would have had a good time  Is that your fav sports car 
- - Victory fan  but honestly surprised than Bes did nt go down there
  - Yeh same  when he got in there I was waiting for it .
- - They probably got arrested for pot . I know a couple people who have said the same thing after getting busted .
  - Why would nt they say Colorado  Oregon  or Washington  then  I thought California still only had it decriminalized .
- - How does raping a child help spread islam 
  - I think they would then raise the girl under their ownership and have lots of muslim babies For the glory of allah
- - Intermittent fasting and slow pace fasted cardio in the mornings .
  - Thanks . I guess this thread got brigaded 
- - Panther fans  would you rather play SEA or GB 
  - I feel like we match up much better against Seattle
- - It seems like Moho does nt want to be a pro player anymore ...
  - I think he does but it is just hard to pick up good and known players when you are nt in the league .
- - Interesting  I m also waiting for an order from them  ordered the same time as you .
  - Nice to know I m not the only one .
- - Have you seen that video of her singing Jolene  It s really wonderful . Country . That s where she belongs .
  - Yes I have and I agree  I also think she has that throaty voice that would be great for jazz also .
- - If me and my brother enlist same time  what are the odds of being station together for tech if we both go for the same 
  - If you guys have the same job then yea you ll go to the same tech school .
- - Oh dear  you re blind too 
  - I do nt want to let the country down .
- - The only place i might have seen them is microcenter on bethel . Or my brain is confusing microcenter with thinkgeek .
  - I ve bought them from thinkgeek  but I think I ve seen them at MicroCenter too .
- - POS Trash . People leave ships floating inside POS shields all the time .
  - This is the usual reason . Player owned structures can be scanned down too so you can confirm if a ship is in  or out  of one .
- - Interstellar was right  We re going to Saturn 
  - Mankind was born on Earth . It was never meant to die here .
- - So you logic that God would prefer a person to die due to dysphoria than allow them to transition 
  - You are aware that transitioning does not lower suicide rates  in fact slightly increases them 
- - Hitting children is NEVER okay . These people are monsters .
  - But their wooden spoons are controlled by grace . No  you re right  they re idiots .
- - You have a board of supervisors though  Or not even that 
  - He s ignoring that every city has city council . Who cares about county  Go to city council meetings .
- - I d say most aggressive country  I would nt say most powerful there is a massive difference . One day the bully will get their comeuppance .
  - America is definitely the most powerful country in military strength which is what we were referring to .
- - I assume it s the return of that uggo Marcus Louis .
  - But nobody can expect Prince Pretty to take on the uggo of all uggos . That uggo does nt deserve to touch Tyler .
- - I think that the MotoX would be one of the best choices for one handed use .
  - Thanks  I ll check that out . I ve been checking out the Droid Turbo  but the Moto X has been popping up lately .
- - It s better when in the context of this sub .
  - Agreed . Zero puckered anuses so far .
- - I m afraid of messing up the factory tuning but I do like playing with my toys so I might have to try adjusting them . I really like your cable 
  - I m thinking of making another and selling this one if you re interested . . p
- - This game that came with windows . I ca nt remember what it was called but it involved a mouse blocking a cat with cheese .
  - A cat can not see directly under its nose .
- - Jones would destroy him at either weight . Werdum needs to worry about Cain before running his mouth about a guy in a smaller weight class .
  - IMHO  Werdum puts Jones to sleep  or is breaking one of his bones . If Werdum gets you where Vitor did  you re not getting out .
- - wait  really  He does nt lose a stock for that  I m not super clear on all the rules .
  - In theory Westballz could have called him out on that rule  but he chose not to  since he would have definitely died regardless of the pause .
- - Are you on the office  I feel like you re Jim in that season he works in Philly ...
  - coincidentally i live in pennsylvania that s where the office is from
- - This is beautiful . Any chance of a print  It d make the perfect gift for my Dad .
  - Do nt have any available yet as of yet unfortunately .
- - Expensive  Have these people been to Norway  But awesome  ca nt argue with that .
  - Let me put it this way - Sweden was the only country so far where I had to live in a hostel to make travel expenses somewhat more palatable .
- - There is no reason for the ranks to transfer over to the retail version when that releases .
  - So then why do so many people get so butt hurt about losing their ranks 
- - This anthem makes me want to fight some Germans
  - I think Russians are new bad guys for quite some time .
- - Am i the only one that got out of bed after reading this to load up the game and buy this gun 
  - Not . Dunno if ill make it though
- - I want a LoL version with Shy  Madlife  and Flame so bad ...
  - You got ta get passed Space prison for that request .
- - good luck . I hear colorado s a pretty place . cold  but pretty .
  - Haha I m from the North East  so that would be nothing new .
  - I m from southern california  so it would be quite new to me . P
  - Haha  now you ve got me rethinking it .
- - I m pretty sure Greg has said that he planned on voting Richard anyways . His question was just to make fun of the serious nature of tribal council .
  - Does nt change the fact that you can call anyone lucky by playing the what-if game
- - This is great  It seems like something that actually happened in the avatar universe .
  - Thanks  buddy . That s actually the idea  believe it or not . Glad I pulled it off .
- - I have read books  but not watched videos . That s a good idea .
  - I find that sometimes watching it and following is easier with most crafts . Good luck if you give it another go .
- - The Death Look is the best thing ever . I howl when I see him stomp off after a hit like that  looks like fuckin  RoboCop with that visor .
  - Marshawn adopted the look on the sidelines last game .
- - He should have gotten a doctor s note 
  - Or made up a more believable lie .
- - What if that has never happened and has no indication of happening anytime soon 
  - What if it has happened and has indication of happening soon
