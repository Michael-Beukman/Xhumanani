  - I wonder how Idaho fared  honestly .
- - Do like Regan ... You re all fired .

- - Glad to see her set of talents are highly demanded in the industry ...
  - She s an old friend of Robert Downey Jr .
- - Medics are usually very attentive of their team . You probably did nt look like you were trying to track down a team mate to heal .

- - I wish jokes about Nepeta dying horribly would get old  but they never ever do .
  - They never seem to die . unlike Nepeta

- - It s meant to be ironic  bro .
  - I do nt think you mean ironic . I think you mean condescending or sarcastic .
- - this forum is filled with posts by ppl that do nt know how to think for themselves ...
  - If discussion is nt the main focus of the forum what is the sense of it then 
- - It s weird because the Cardinals are known for having one of the best social media teams in the league .

  - People get online to play against others  not to watch them cheat a victory .
- - The way I see it is that when Arno kills a target  their life glasses before their eyes  and Arno  using Eagle Sense  can see that .

- - So would nt that make the beam sword impossible to defend against  And hence an ultimate weapon
  - I believe it can be stopped by beam shields . I m only telling you what Wacky said in his videos . P i m really not an expert .

  - Yeah well  i agree with you buddy but you asked why they did nt like it .
- - I think the circle jerk is more of a circle joke than anything ...
  - It s actually amazing how many people do nt understand this .
- - You re supposed to leave the heat on as well
  - and probably run hot water  or at least a mix of cold and hot
  - Hot and cold are mixed at the tap  it would nt have any effect on the cold water line
  - shows what i know . never lived in the north .

- - When it could cost me my career  yes ... Have a nice day  I hope we can make some positive changes to DotA in the future as a community 
  - Oh wow guys  he s a famous but anonymous dota guy we better listen to his vague pretentious bullshit 
- - Bend your knees more too . Shorter wheelbase want to grip up .
  - I find them to be more slippery  am I doing something wrong 
  - They lose traction easier but they re harder to hold out slides on .
  - But they want to snap back easier  I have a lot of trouble with that
- - More proof that nothing good ever happens in Wisconsin .
  - You should see how it feels like to be a Canadian . We re your neighbour and we do nt get anything .
- - I think India is already preparing for the World Cup with the team they picked
  - This run rate is even worrying for ODIs .
- - Failing at the very least  but if it boots with the old card and not the new card you can at least get into windows and check drivers .
  - What should i look after  or just install the new drivers 
  - Try to do a clean install of the drivers from Nvidias website  shutdown  swap GPU  and start it up .
  - Gon na do this now  will update .

  - The property tax in catherby is almost as high as yanille tho and the emergency services suck in the area . Not to mention there was a murder just north of there
- - Not a fan of either team but I wish the best of luck to both sides . This is a great game so far
  - We are less of a threat . root for us

- - But a few centuries ago you would have been stoned to death for sure
  - Did people surf a few centuries ago

- - Her bellybutton has become a perpendicular anus .
  - It really  really has . I ve never seen a more disgusting looking bellybutton . I m almost impressed .

  - Agreed . I m not sure if it s the stadium lighting or just the particular color code that Adidas used for the dye .
- - Standing clear of the riptide ; you are wise .
  - We saw three people jump in the water and the lifeguard was blowing the whistle at them . They did nt even get out right away .

  - It doesnt  wf and sm are completely random
- - Do you eat everything you kill  Cause if not you can stick the gun in your ass .

- - Well once they graduate in march that wont be a problem anymore .
  - There s still loads of past SG stuff that s yet to be translated that almost certainly should be posted here once it is .
- - I was going to say that  but I thought I should give the U.S. Digs a break .
  - They re probably asleep now . Or off being free and murican

  - no offense  but people say the same thing about hoxhud causing crashes . then they uninstall and still get crashes .
  - Thanks for the info so about the music shuffling ...
- - The UI is terrible and it lags for everyone . However  with your minimap open you map shoulnt be forced to open  when someone pings .

  - OP knew what he was doing . You do nt pick huge pop cultural icons on accident .
- - Is that the proper term for a group of kids  TIL ...
  - The proper term for a group of kids is a nightmare .

  - You do know the story of The Mighty Jax right 
- - It s been framed as consumer protection but it s simply an excuse for the government to be able to further regulate a market that has been strangled to death already .
  - In what ways has the market been strangled 
- - I ve never tried using Intel s Auto Update utility  I just verify the driver version via Device Manager .
  - This has resulted in inconsistent behaviour  though .
- - Yes  he was a great one . No other author in SciFi history has a fanbase with so many people who pretend to have read him .
  - haha there s so much Asimov out there most of the fakers have probably read him by accident anyway .
- - It would have been worse not telling .
  - I agree . At least you told her  OP . Better than keeping it bottled up like I did .
- - My bathroom is a shit hole apparently ...
  - I think you re referring to the toilet ...
- - Have you tried swiping up to get Control Center open to see if mute is activated

  - Switch your browser  Update your plug ins  Try disabling any weird plug ins you may have 
- - They said they wo nt read any GG related comments . Chances are  They freaked out and cut it off so as not to open a can of worms .
  - I only posted this because I found it distasteful . I was not very inconvenienced  and I do nt sub to KiA  but I find such surgical censorship repugnant .
- - Mirrors entity never copies the battlecry . Minion is played by opponent Battlecry triggers and effects occur Minion is copied .
  - Ya that s his point  OP s minion got copied  and then his battlecry did nt trigger for some reason .
- - At least sometimes they get Darude - Sandstorm out of the way at the beginning .
  - It s not a true FRC event without it playing five times  mate .

  - oh  my bad . they might be  do nt have much knowledge about them tbh . i just assumed .
- - There s a Jeremy Kyle USA now  so they can share our pain . Hopefully he ll stay over there  like that massive cunt Piers Morgan .
  - You ca nt call Morgan a cunt - he lacks the necessary depth and warmth .
- - Was nt there something similar with Gox where they claimed they only lost a little bit of butts first 
  - Yes  they went to maintenance too .
- - TIL African Ivory is the ideal coke surface 
  - Jeez  have you tried doing more than a kilo through Asian ivory  Ugh .
- - Lucky you  I ca nt get my wife to play . Makes me sad .
  - Right  Plus my wife barely gives me a chance to play . lol
- - Whites like that should be forced to live in the ghettos with their nigger friends . See how long they defend niggers and disrespect police after that .
  - Detroit for a week would do the trick .
- - Curl in the squat rack . Always curl in the squat rack
  - Between sets  pull up a chair and rest in the squat rack too .

  - You ever listen to any Houston hiphop  They re a little more than proud .
- - What if what s bothering me is more abstract  Like guilt 
  - Sit with the feeling . Observe it  do nt try to name it or categorize it . Just allow it to arise and pass away naturally .
- - So you think women are inferior to men and should nt have equal rights 
  - No  in my eyes we re all equal under the sun - regardless of race  sex or religion . Do nt get your knickers in a twist jeez
- - Sure  there is GPS drift and other random errors  but GPS still gets more accurate when measured in relation to another GPS receiver .
  - Only when differential GPS is used . Two independent GPS systems are no more accurate than one  relative or absolute .
- - Why the fuck is perkins on green 
  - Who should he be on  We are going small .

- - you can watch this or be morons who watch kaceytron instead . And fuck teemo
  - I hear they are releasing an Uber Hitler Satan skin for him .
