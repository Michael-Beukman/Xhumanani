- - wouldnt it be weird if I made a male appreciation thread 
  - You could nt miss the point any harder even if you tried .
- - Since you can find most classical music online for free and legally  prepaid piano lessons are a great idea
  - Sure ... but some of the best editions for certain composers actually cost money  and a pretty penny at that .

  - It definitely needs work . I d say it s mid project .
- - You seem to be forgetting that Waluigi exists
  - I feel the same way about Waluigi as you do about Chris Rock
- - I m pretty sure that s what we still pay here in NZ .
  - But because of inflation you re paying nowhere close to what Bell was charging .
- - so who do we want to play seahawks or packers 
  - If we keep winning we might face both eventually
- - Ngl watching this God squad  lose to a team full of kids is a bit comedic
  - Everyone loves an underdog story ... or nah 
- - Nah  but seeing me out at night is like seeing a unicorn fighting Bigfoot so it does nt really matter .
  - So basically a normal thing on Wednesday nights 
- - I d say there is just a more appropriate sub for the post though .
  - Exactly . To even remotely qualify for that sub the change would need to be more dramatic . It s not an interesting picture .
- - you reckon shami even practices batting at the nets 
  - First let him practice landing the ball in one place consistently .
- - A little off random  but what country do you live in 
  - Costa Rica  according to their comment history .

- - What happens if you spec a match on the watch system  Then  what happens if you rewatch a downloaded demo  Please reply .
  - Same kind of lag both in Live Matches and downloaded demos .
- - Does that mean if you start typing  your ball will lose all velocity 
  - Not immediately . It means if you stop holding a direction you will stop accelerating that direction . This is expected behavior if you think about it .
- - I agree puns can be objectively clever  I do nt know about objectively funny though . Funny is just such a subjective word  though clever is too .
  - Funny and clever are sort of interchangeable for me in reference to jokes .
- - I m on an app I could nt put flair . I m referring to Sean Payton and Joe vitt

- - It may get them too dry too fast . Be careful .
  - I cant tell if this is a joke or if thats a legit problem
- - Whoops I meant to say Renault instead of Peugeot  though we get none of them anyway .
  - Bummer . Sorry to hear that  because they are making some cars that would be perfect for OP s requirements .
- - tbh  i wish chat never existed in this game and you communicated through pings only . Would make it way more pleasant to play .
  - I do nt think that would ve been a great Idea there s alot of things you ca nt communicate through pings like enemy flashes  dragon timers  etc .

- - I m allergic to aloe vera ... your porn is my nightmare
  - Why does everyone say that to me 
- - Yes  I mean what type of question is that
  - Wo nt robots take all the jobs

  - So how will you know when you ve completed this goal so you can actually move on to a second goal 
- - A personality so split that we do nt even know who we are anymore   lol

- - Any idea if this guy is okay 
  - He was actually a she  We did nt have much in common but I saw her posting to other people . I m not too sure to be honest .
- - Yea thats the problem . A focus on making a game thats balanced with no bullshit . Totally whats fucking up the franchise ...
  - If you are calling this game balanced you are blind .
- - Just imagine all of the old gum spat everywhere ...
  - Since cigarettes will be illegal one day  you need something to pick up in lieu of butts .
- - Sounds like a cool idea  and if it were to happen I would support it  but of course I doubt Nexon will do anything about it .
  - Considering they just released the mechanical graveyard  it will be a while before seeing more high level content  but I doubt Nexon would ignore it .
- - Yea pretty sure this is one of the biggest deals I ve seen .
  - Deals just dont get any bigger than this deal here
  - You guys have nt seen my deal .

  - Wow  never really thought one could be so in the dark about their own desires .
- - Wait  you go through drive thrus in reverse  That d be interesting to watch lol
  - You have to unless you have a passenger . Too far away to grab the food  and the car is too low to just chuck it through the window .
- - I ve got not graphic  There are little ridges on one side of the wheel though  this is the shallow side .
  - Yeah the little ridges are the bottom of the wheel mold  which is the side that faces the hanger
  - Is there any certain reason for this 
  - I think the ridges are to prevent bubbles while being poured or something
- - That you think there s even the slightest possibility that the merger might not go through .
  - I never said that . I said that it has nt completed .

  - I d rather only those who can recognize it already get it .

- - Totally get Eric . You should either get an alt or old away jersey  I do nt know why but they seem the best Staal jerseys
  - I m looking at a Alt Staal sweater . I live the way they look .
- - Does this have any advantages over Tasker  I downloaded it and did nt see any reason to switch over .
  - The main advantage is it s free . So other than that  not really .
- - Garbage article . Pretty sure academy training entails more than just a one day exercise on the use of force .
  - The video is trying to point out that these decisions are very hard to make and you have to make them quickly .
- - Come on everybody has pissed outside some point in their life . Fair enough she should have done it somewhere more secluded
  - But ugh look at all those empties she s peeing next to ...
- - still to this day i get nervous with doing things like this . I always sit and stare and the command wondering if it s correct  knowing it is .

  - Show me on this doll where the Vice President touched you 
- - Can confirm I work Produce . I hate everything .
  - Do nt be so hard on yourself . You know that s not true . You love hating everything  ergo  you do not hate everything .
- - Perhaps  but a blanket statement that the problem will naturally resolve itself is still over simplifying it
  - Well  technically it would  but it could take a while for the populations  rise and fall patterns to end up in a holding sine wave .
- - Yeah for sure if you re in that state you would go . But loads of people in Ireland put off doctor visits because of the cost .
  - They definitely do put off going to the doctor s  wo nt argue with ya there
- - Sweet looking chair . What is it 
  - I need info on that chair . OP  please deliver .

  - I did  sorry . I think you made a lot of good points .

  - I have a minimalist shirt that is just his hair and eyebrows but it s so obviously him . Great shirt
- - You really should change your mind about cooking . Without cooking you have absolutely no control over what you are eating . And life is a lot more boring .

  - I really wish Apple would make a high capacity Touch to replace the Classic .

- - Respect the right to hold the belief  do nt respect bad beliefs .
  - And especially do nt respect their desire to impose their beliefs upon other people .
- - Maybe Jovetic for the next few weeks then switch to Giroud when you bring Aguero back in  I think Giroud s probably the best bet in the long run though .
  - I just brought in Giroud for Bony . Now I have the problem of who to bench for the next GW . I think maybe Eriksen .
- - But now it s barely passive anymore  you have to babysit them every hour .
  - Having to x out of ads and clear crashes like on SB is babysitting . Hitting a button once every hour per phone is nothing .
- - I dunno  I bring the muscle  what do you show up to the party with 
  - The camera . Every fight has a camera man
- - Extramarital stuff  Did nt he say he was anti cheating

  - Thanks for the support  Ive spent enough time dwelling on my past  now its time to put it behind me and move on to a better sober life
- - Arena turned down Torres because he did nt want him not because he already knew who else was coming in to fill the spare DP slot .
  - If you think Arena has nt been in negotiations for month with a European club then I have some swamp land in Florida I d like to sell you .
- - Scooters . They re everywhere and i ca nt see the appeal other than being easy to ride .
  - As skateboarder there also obnoxious and often in the way
- - Im curious  was the smoke monster actually Jacob s brother or did it just take his appearance 
  - Pretty sure it just took his appearance due to the whole two dead bodies in the cave just being his mother and brother .
- - thats not family sharing  this happens when you use the same folder system and the same steam exe .
  - Can I set it to install into different folders for different accounts 
- - Let s hope the media lets Kane develop in peace instead of hyping him up to next biggest thing and then castrating him when he fails to deliver .
  - lol  good luck  the media are the worst - commentator almost had a stroke when Costa was limping a bit
- - I prefer to shoot at people who do nt see me . Especially those already in a duel . It saves thousands of arrows .
  - You monster  Have some mercy for us fighters .

  - The account is fake  but he tweeted this two years ago on a different account .
- - You know the Buscemi death thing was a hoax right 
  - check the sub you re in then go check any news site for the name Stuart .
  - Ugh . Stuart Scott died . Have you seen his eyes 
  - Ah fair play . I did nt realise the dude also had a lazy eye  I had never heard of him until he was dead .
- - I might get it . It s that it Evolve .
  - Evolve has me interested but im worried it may get old fast
- - I searched up a lot and it still does nt work D .
  - Then the port is nt open . You have to go into your router and get it open .
- - I hope that s what I can expect from retirement .
  - Retirement  F that  this is how I want my entire life to be .
- - Yes . In our current system  I can make the choice to purchase goods made here and can purchase them from a company that chose to make them here .
  - but does nt our current system also make far more difficult to sustain a business model of made in america 
- - Or just stuff a giant pillow into it and use it as a pillowcase . T-shirts are great in a pinch for pillowcases .
  - Good idea  never thought about that .

  - This is literally the first time I ve ever heard anybody praising MadTV over SNL . I guess anything is possible .

  - In sc  coroners are both medical professionals and officers
  - That s cool . My county coroner is a veterinarian . Before him  it was a guy who made dog food .
- - Cycle  That s a rare word around these parts
  - Ive heard of that . Thought it was bro science
- - Did you learn nothing from pandaria  You let your anger take control of yourself .
  - That s how you get race specific garrisons .
- - He d stick out too well . You ca nt have a background character towering over everyone .
  - Maybe with Star Wars background characters you have a bit more flexibility ...
- - I live in Oklahoma and there are earthquakes  I move to LA and there are tornadoes . What the fuck is going on  
  - Maybe you should move back . You might be throwing everything off .
- - IMO the challenger scene is at the point where a team can get relegated and still survive for a split or possibly two depending on where the money is coming from .
  - It still sucks for a team to lose their spot by default if they are better than the CS team that replaced them .
- - My thoughts exactly on the Toslink - such a useful cable that frees up an additional USB slot . The only requirement is for your motherboard to allow Toslink input .
  - Most do  but even if yours does nt I m sure you could find an adapter to USB .
- - I feel like if the NFL wanted Dallas to win they would have just kept Suh out like they should have instead of embarrassing themselves like that .
  - Suh was easily the best Lion in this game and he had no business being on the field after the bullshit he pulled last week .
- - It just needs tracking really  and maybe a slight damage boost . I use mine with the velocity perk and it is nt too bad .
  - Yeah but even then your just using it for the sake of it  it s not really worth the slot it takes is it
- - Truth maybe small dares I can do at a gym .
  - Take a bunch of pics of yourself in front of the mirror flexing at the gym
- - I JUST MADE MYSELF AN EGG SANDWICH BECAUSE LIQUOR UPVOTE PARTY
  - egg is supposed to be the hangover remedy in the morning . bacon egg and cheese .
- - There are idiots everywhere  including this website .
  - I find they seem to congregate here . I m obviously one of them  because I keep coming back
- - Jokes on you . I used icebreaker to regenerate ammo for black hammer .
  - Haha . That s what my Ice Breaker has been reduced to after obtaining Black Hammer .
- - Yeah  I get where you re coming from  but this is a gross oversimplification of the problem .
  - This same sentence could be posted on any front page thread .
- - Matt Damon and Maxwell Perry Cotton in Elysium . He s a mini doppelgnger 
  - That s what I thought about the kid who plays a younger Matt Damon in the Departed 
- - Was the cleaning mentioned in your lease agreement  Sounds to me like you got ripped off .
  - It just said I had to return the unit back in its original condition . No mention of professional cleaning .
- - I d be saying its been keeping me from getting a girlfriend but I d be lying . If it was nt Taylor Swift it d be video games .
  - Taylor Swift and video games here . Just gets me in the zone . Got a girlfriend who loves me in spite of my obsessions though 
- - Yes  yes we do  You should do some cutting demonstrations and post videos . Like dropping a hair on a knife edge and stuff like that .
  - Maybe if I can convince my girlfriend it s not stupid and can get her to video cutting demos lol .
- - Why the hell would you put a gixxer front end on this bike with dual front disks and not use both of them  fucking stupid .
  - Maybe the customer asked to use a wheel wheel with disc mounts only on one side 
- - I asked this question and was told Boys in the Hood  which actually turned out to be great . So go rent that .
  - On my way to the nearest blockbuster now 
- - She planned to take it to her grave .
  - I up voted you . I feel wrong doing it but I did .
- - I hope Anderson gets some game time . I bet if van gaal plays him  he will impress 
  - Viv Anderson has a better chance of impressing .
- - Wow  I thought I was the only one who thought dating was a necessary chore  lol .
  - Nope  I m right there with you . I keep hoping there s some magical way to get to the end result without putting the work in .
- - My boyfriend used to mock my giant bags ... now they are snack totes for the movies and he has nt mocked them since .
  - I stole the idea from my mom . There s six of us so the movies were expensive but she made them cheaper .
- - How do I get involved in this 
  - Just join the teamspeak and we ll help you from there 
- - Do you ever feel  feel so paper thin  like a house of cards  one blow from caving in 
  - Do you ever feel Already burry deep Six feet under  Screams but no one seems to hear a thing 
- - I also had a few times in metal parade where I only got ghosts and then the guaranteed king ... RNGesus is catching up to me after so many good pulls .
  - unless they changed something recently  i dont think a king is guaranteed in metal parade runs .
- - If not infighting then a weaker leader . Each successive king has been weaker in saudi arabia
  - king Abdullah is an image  and everyone knows .
- - Not extremely lyrically complex and attacked Biggie even when he would nt respond .
  - Biggie did respond  he just did nt believe in putting names in songs and Pac is nt lyrically complex  what 
- - You re telling me you guys planned out this situation in advance yet he did nt douche  Gross .
  - What a ... ugh  too easy .
- - It s always funny to watch Christians act like scientists .
  - It bears a striking resemblance to a monkey in a suit acting like a businessman  At least  the ones who try to bring their religion into the laboratory .
- - I really want them to try mexico first  those guys seem crazier .
  - Yeah  then we ll read about a heap of terrorists found buried somewhere in a mass grave .
- - Still hiring for Consultant  Implementation and Deployment  sounds similar to a majority of my role now working with national clients .
  - Most definitely  If you have any questions let me know .
- - I m not sure if I should apologize for my ignorance or laugh at you for expecting normal people to know that .
  - Judging by the down votes  you should apologize 
- - This is nt a hoarder situation is it  You do nt have any other collections do you 
  - No . I am most certainly not a hoarder . I simply like retro games  and television sets . Can a person not have things that bring him happiness 
- - I do nt wash my hands after I pee . It s sterile 
  - also because i do nt pee on my hands
- - Thats brilliant . I ve been listening to a lot of ambient trance and i am always listening to punk rock and postpunk
  - Awesome man  Any favourite punk bands 
  - Most things that Iggy Pop  Tim Armstrong  or Fat Mike are involved in .
  - Fat mike is the man  Finally got around too seeing NOFX last summer  was so epic . They do nt play over here too much 
- - If only I could find cs . go as fun ...
  - Quake live is free to play so it is always a good way to go .
- - Why d you block me on steam 
  - prob missclick  and i traded the knife already
- - i mean ... wasnt bad ... wasnt great ... it got done tho .
  - I disagree . It flies fine  so those elements surely were designed to fall off at start . It went all according to plan .
- - Did you notice anything about the conversation between Cat and Renly  Something about her reflection in his armor 
  - During which scene  This may be something I missed 
- - Idaho eh  I ll have to keep an eye out for you .
  - Do it  In the SE ID area and I m usually out and about
- - Could be the next Arsenal manager  him .
  - At this point  anything can be possible .
- - Dead space is bad in a sleeping bag  more air to heat up . The closer the bag is to your body  the warmer it will feel .
  - Agreed - it takes a while to get used to sleeping in them
- - talk me out of cousins  everyone is gon na pick him today
  - Only other options are Dieng and Noah and out of the two I like Noah but there s the blowout risk .
- - There should be like ... pictures at least  am I right 
  - I chuckled ... then I remembered how that s actually happened . Several times
- - This is empirically false . Kindly fellate yourself in a different castle .
  - It is nt empirically false . None of the current video game consoles use a Japanese made CPU or GPU . It s objectively true .
- - No  the dude was found dead from killing himself weeks before .
  - Yes  that s exactly what I said .
- - title is misleading ... I would nt say he escaped at all
  - Also it s not zombies but instead they re called infected .
- - So you do nt think there are any possible new ideas in Philosophy of the Mind or any new ways of presenting an argument 
  - Every couple years  I do nt think so . Certainly not enough to fill a book written for the layman .
  - I ll translate it for you . Why do people buy his books  Because laymen are interested in philosophy .
  - I m interested in math  I do nt keep buying calc I books . I buy books that have some new content I have nt seen before .
- - What team will u support after the Borussia BVB s get relegated 
  - I will support the West Ham National team
- - Test your security  I cant stress this enough .
  - Do you have any good and specific recommendations for testing the security 
- - Got a Benchmade North Fork . Proceeded to slice open my thumb nearly immediately .
  - Now you need to buy a new gun to protect yourself while going to the hospital
- - The ones they sell at Universal are not . They do sell some beers at a couple of restaurants if that s what you re looking for .
  - I m not much of a beer person . . c
  - I m not  either . I m actually not much of an alcohol person in general .
  - I actually bought my first alcoholic drink last week from World Market . I did nt even like it . I m more of a really fruity drink kind of person .
- - ah . are you going for the Little Sister style of syringe or the standard kind 
  - Standard healthcare kind . I ve always wanted to be a Little Sister as well  lol .
- - How much do you know and what do you like 
  - I like rock  punk  and ska . I think I m a decent player at best but I ve only been practicing for a week or two .
  - You re not a decent player if you ve been playing guitar under two weeks .
  - I ve been playing for like a year and a half and i m a decent player
- - karnataka is full of people who think religious fanatics are fools but u must drool over people who speak ur language .
  - I guess the rest of India drools over incoherence .
- - That s ... the worst angle that could possible be shot from
  - Oh It s not a great picture  I just think it proves those tweets that some angle may of occurred ...
- - Thanks for the reply  but I was thinking more in terms of the story as it pertains to Netrunner beginning with the core set .
  - Ah  well I think you ll be disappointed then - I m fairly certain the game does nt occur within some specific set of events .
- - Because health is nt subjective . Entertainment is . To clarify  I m not against the licence fee .
  - No  I think its more about the visibility of the license fee .
- - I hope all this bs that s happening does nt push him away from the club . I could nt bare to see Messi leave .
  - My heart would brea -- shatter to tiny  tiny pieces .
- - Any back story  Why were the cops forcefully pulling her out of the car 
  - It really does nt matter . There is no situation in which her response was appropriate .
- - Do humans change color in the winter or something 
  - Nah they change color in the Summer  when they get tan under the sun .
- - I know that players have value  but why ca nt we just release players that dont belong like Nani and Evans 
  - Because that means paying out all of there wages and ends up costing the club money . If we sell the players the club makes money .
  - I get it  I just am tired of the level of play .
  - re s to hoping things keep improving 
- - making it illegal to be homeless in the streets of some major cities
  - I agree with those laws . It allows the homeless to get shelter  meals and possibly into a program to help them out .
- - Last I checked  Eli does nt play d-line  and Brady does nt play secondary .
  - Where did I say Eli was going to beat Brady  You Patriots trolls are something .
- - I think he means . yes I have to do all the steps without quitting the game 
  - I just unlocked it last night  and I quit my game at least once between runs  probably twice . You can quit the game and come back later .
- - I m going to choose to believe that this is just a bad joke
  - I agree  it s just too perfect .
- - No More commercials have prevented exactly zero cases of domestic violence .
  - Those ads are so bad they actually kind of make me want to beat my wife
- - That d be the yeast to use for sure .
  - But wo nt the low yeast yield a lower ABV
- - Perfect example of why cops alway want to see your hands  they never know what the fuck you will get out of the car with ...
  - Or what s in your pockets . Some kid at my college got pissed when a cop kept telling him not to put his hands in his pockets .
- - They need to make halftime long enough to get a solid fap in . With the way it works right now I always feel rushed .
  - Start a nonprofit and call it Jackoff By Kickoff
- - yes there is..i only got bad stats like apothecary though
  - My fiance got an ascended berserker armor box his very first PvP match . I wanted to kill him for that bit of luck .
- - If they really loved their bodies  maybe they would nt fill it with garbage until it collapsed on itself
  - But that makes logical sense . Why would they do that 
- - I played against that thing the other day  strangest match I ve had in a while
  - It s strange and hilarious but I found it has little consistency and many bad matchups .
- - Lancer v Defense warrior . Who d win 
  - Defense warrior beats everything if the person is good . It s a lot harder to play a good defense warrior than a good lancer though .
- - I personally would do nothing else . That is so clean  Maybe a winch and bumper .
  - agreed  I love the clean look . A locker  maybe 
- - Or any of the red states that are also expanding medicaid .
  - I m running off the assumption he s in a state without expansion . The red states have been real slow on this .
- - Yeah I do nt think anyone is going to help you pirate it .
  - I really do nt see what the big deal is . It s mostly just a bunch of slides and labs .
- - the use of ellipsis there make me want to hear this long story now ...
  - It s up there . I do nt know how to link you to comments because I m a nub .
  - I was nt suggesting linking it . Just letting her know how to in the event the situation arises again . Why are you so antagonistic 
  - Sorry  I thought you were complaining . You are right  it is an option .
- - Spyro the dragon  was playing it today actually . So much nostalgia 
  - First I game ever beat . It ll always be special to me for that reason . The old platformers were outstanding games in general .
- - One of the few goals that s genuinely baffled me .
  - Goal of the year for a reason . P
- - Bcuz it was YOUR loading screen that crashed .
  - Yeah but how would I know it crashed  It did nt notify me or go unresponsive .
- - I d be that happy if I got that much stuff from a restaurant . The plushies tho
  - Those gift cards  though . Their diet is gon na be very greasy for a while  but soooo worth it . Mmm .
- - The rule  like every other rule ever made  was made with a goal in mind .
  - Is it so hard to follow the rules  Quit using your own interpretation .
- - Quick response  no  stop spreading completely unfounded misinformation .
  - You are right  I honestly do nt even record writing this 
- - Personally I find an app called Unified Remote much easier to use than Remote Desktop . It turns your phone into a mouse and keyboard with other neat features
  - You just totally changed my world tonight . Thank you 
- - I would literally kill for a job like that .
  - Probably should nt put that on your resume .
- - When are you coming back to notts  saw you at the maze last year and was top notch 
  - We ll be touring our new album once it s written  Nothing set in stone yet ...
- - I always wish I could see the kind of people that type vitriol like this and what they look like .
  - I wish your Mom could suck my dick more than twice a week but you ca nt always get what you want .
- - Could you maybe answer to my question as well  I ve already SR d for your Jirachi  and still have nt received payment from you yet though . . S
  - I do nt have money for it . Maybe after I sell some events . I had money for it before you sent your game to taiwan or wherever .
- - When was this  Surprised to see him in the states . Any word of what MLS teams Tottenham will play this summer 
  - It was this past summer . Spurs played a match against the Chicago Fire and Harry threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the Chicago Cubs baseball game .
- - Not always  but in some cases with certain cards yeah it does diminish value
  - Ok but this is an autograph card ...
- - Has a ref ever been punched before 
  - No but if i was at the game i woulda tried
- - oh wow  that s really cool  I love her markings  they re awesome  Thank you very much  great work 
  - You re welcome . I might gon na do a second version on this  since it irks me that I did nt manage to get it all together well .
- - Statistically  Geno is significantly better . A LOT of Bills fans really do nt seem to grasp just how bad EJ is .
  - What stats you talking  Because it makes a big difference . And I m not even talking up EJ . Geno is just as painfully awful .
- - Wait you have an unlimited plan option  I heard verizon does nt have those anymore ...
  - Like I said I have a corporate discount plan  which offers data plans not normally available to the public .
- - Maybe they were at a play  strip club 
  - I think a strip club makes great sense . Jesus would probably want to see some titties with his last meal .
- - Get a dildo . Get . a. dildo . GET A DILDO .
  - Yes  sounds like OP gets off being filled up so a dildo could possibly help .
- - They re probably all stuck after climbing in for food and now ca nt climb back out .
  - OP  throw them a little ladder  pls .
- - People would still do it bit it d be harder to do  I m not against murder  just easy murder
  - Lots of murders happen with knives anyway  itd just make a lot more heads get bashed in and a lot more stabs to the throat
- - Jeez the commentators are really giving it to Rutherford . I guess it s about time though .
  - they ve had to save it for when ken s not in the room
- - Why not try both out  and see which one works best  Wo nt take very much time  and you can be certain you chose the right one .
  - I think I ll do that  thanks . I just wanted to see if it was even worth it before trying
- - It s definitely not associated with all the disposal and fracking wells in the area . Nope definitely not that . Probably just jesus  love .
  - Jesus saves you know  you just have to tell him to and  well  there you are  saved 
- - Just like every Indian is nt going to rape me  every American is nt going to shoot you . The Internet amplifies news .
  - If you are a blonde woman travelling alone in India  you are more likely than not to be inappropriately touched by strangers . Has nothing to do with the news .
- - Lol Delusion . Just like we re not getting Dez Bryant Oakland and San Fran wo nt get the Olympics because of MUH BOSTON TRAGEDY
  - This stadium is in conjunction with SF Olympics .
- - The Dickheads Would make for a good show .
  - I think there was an In Living Color sketch about that .
- - Thats was pretty cool . Singer was probably the weakest part in my opinion .
  - Hahah I think their singer is the one who posted it
- - Then factor in the loading screens ... Ug .
  - Then factor in last gen loading times . Ug again .
- - Well  not exactly every religion  check out Jainism .
  - You re probably right about Jains . They re such a small group however it s tough to classify them with the other big religions .
- - We have a WiFi Matchmaking chatroom on the side  which is decently active  please go check out the peeps on there .
  - Thanks  I ll be sure to check it out 
- - The show was cancelled for low ratings when Carrey was the host . Jesus you re a dipshit .
  - Then the tried that green screen version  that was pretty rough IMO .
