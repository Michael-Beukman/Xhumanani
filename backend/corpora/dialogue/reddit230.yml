- - Wishing cancer on someone is such a shitty insult . I mean there are so many funnier and more creative ways of insulting someone .
  - Like your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries 
  - Electric donkey bottom biters is also excellent .
  - I m afraid I do nt understand that one old sport . Mind explaining it to me 
  - It s a reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail . Classic british comedy and a must-see before you die . . P
  - Well thats what I was referencing as well  I guess I must ve missed that joke . Oh well  time to watch it again ...

  - People rooting against independence . Of course people see that as nessecary . You are forcing it upon them .
- - I m sure HE did nt do those things . Which is the point of his argument .
  - Some people can not understand  or maybe they do nt want to understand what others are saying . They have their opinions and they are always right . Period .
- - Might aswell make the game pay per month and give all players all cards . See how long that garbage would survive then  probably not very long .

- - All this stuff seems like a comedy sketch on SNL or something .
  - Thought you of all people would nt give into this circlejerk
- - why do the recruiters in IT put folks who know nothing  Is it because the field is so broad 
  - When you think of IT most people think of the bloke that runs around fixing printers
- - This is ridiculous . It s like a small child crying because they are grounded . You broke the rules and are being subsequently punished  deal with it .
  - Right now it s the case of a child throwing a tantrum because he was the only one punished for what everyone else was doing too .
  - More like the only child too stupid to get caught doing what all the other kids do
  - How are they more stupid  Explain since you have such a good grasp on the situation I ve followed religiously .
- - Why make things happen that are not meant to be . It s just as retarded as going as CM Carry .
  - who s to say what s meant to be anyway  that is retarded logic
- - Losing someone is nt always a loss .
  - This is true . Ik it was for the greater good  just still sucks losing somebody .
- - Should I throw it away or keep waiting

  - Yup . Whoever was worried this movie would nt get the attention deserves doesnt know Marvel .
- - Heart rate monitors do not work for tracking calories burned lifting weights
  - Can you explain why  If nothing else wo nt it give an estimate so OP can track it 
- - I know that but I just think it s ridiculous that we pay tax payer money for them to maintain a section with this kind of low level gutter journalism .
  - As I said  this is the frontpage for everything at CBC . You wo nt only see news there .
- - Soldier of the Pantheon is not a warrior and can not be buffed by Chief of the edge to smash through a Caryatid .
  - Oh dear ... How did I get it in my head that it was ... o.O Thank you .
- - You ca nt legitimately blame the refs for that after all the crap the Hawks got away with .
  - You can blame them for ruining a good game  but not for the result
- - When the commentator is laughing at the end I ca nt help but laugh with him . I think he s one of the creators of the show .
  - if memory serves correct i m pretty sure that episode just consists of the creators riffing without a script .
- - Walcott gets his first start exactly one year after his last one . Cant wait to see him in action
  - I miss watching him play . If he starts I fancy him to score today
- - Why is this mostly footage of the Ravens and Steelers not playing each other 
  - The same reason the closing image is of the two offensive lines staring each other down . Seems rushed and not very well thought out .
- - So did everyone just stop watching the game  or am I by myself 
  - Has nt really been much to comment on  just your typical losing devils game
  - yeah but there would normally be more even when they are losing .
  - Yeah  it is a quiet thread  I agree with that
- - I did for a few years  but not anymore . Everyone drifted apart and had their own life goals .
  - So like  is it kinda because everyone moves different places  Do you still know them on social media and whatnot 
- - You should send that to akg . That s such a sick photo 
  - Thanks  What would be the best way to do such thing though 
  - Ahh haha . Start it up again 
  - Yeah  lem me see if I can hire some North Korean hacker to take over the account .
- - Good argument - I ll use that . Thanks 
  - I would leave out the bit about not hiring more police . That s something we do nt need more of .
- - Thats a sweet highlight reel  it d be nice if exciting games were given that much time on ESPN still

- - This is what I wanted all along  I trust Chip .
  - Same here . And if anyone can learn from his mistakes it s Chip
- - Thanks for the info  Do you prefer the oil heating 
  - Electrical heating is generally much cheaper . Might have changed recently with lower oil prices  but I have nt been following it enough to know .
- - Spoken like a true nerd with no friends to give gifts too .
  - I give my friends more thoughtful gifts than a tiny plastic Groot .
- - Very beautiful  Do you still play frequently  Recitals take me back  too .
  - Yeah . I go to a conservatory in NYC  teach  and perform . Ca nt say im famous though haha .
- - Your idea is good but it s both easier and better to allow people to join the server when someone leaves .
  - No because then the game wo nt be fair  it pretty much means a free loss to whoever takes the bots place .
- - Omg . You live somewhere with Chick-fil-a ... Supremely jealous .
  - Where do you live that does nt have Chick-fil-A 
- - Idiot question time . If the winning team of this game loses in the championship  does this game count as winning the rose bowl or is there no trophy involved 
  - Why wouldnt it  Plenty of teams have won the Rose Bowl and not the chip
- - Huh that s weird I restarted my game since then but guess it stayed with me lol ty 
  - Interesting I suppose tsv might somehow stay the same on the copy of the game . The froakie and chespin were caught in your game right 
- - Sweet  Another in early access forever game 
  - When is DayZ going to be finished 
- - But it ended with Wu saying he wanted the people to rule themselves with democratically elected leaders
  - Yes . Another TERRIBLE idea . War of the states are soon to follow .
  - Democracy is nt always the easiest option but that does nt mean it is nt the best long term solution for governing diverse groups of people fairly .
  - Local elections is not a democratic rule . Its just a bunch of states trying to get along . Which lasts exactly until it does nt .
- - Looks devine . Are you a chef  If not you should change career . Happy new year my friend 
  - You are very kind  Happy new year

  - yeah I do nt have those . what ROM are you using 
  - Enable under Pure Settings in the Settings Menu .
- - dont  hence good not to have it . leave it to humans  otherwise robots will start batting and bowling soon too .
  - So you d rather have a few wrong decisions than some that could be rectified 
- - Why in gods name are you getting down votes for this 
  - Because it does nt make sense  I did nt up or down vote because I ca nt understand the post at all
- - I believe the person he was replying to was making the very same point .
  - Yes  and I was clarifying exactly what that point was .
- - It s better to have your guidance counselor mention these things as well .
  - Ahh good point . I will speak to her . And you re referring to the one that sends out the school report 
- - Yes would fire us right back into the football league . Doubt we could afford him though
  - Well if he ca nt find a club should nt he take what ever he can get
- - could just be a joke since is it such a mystery as to who this mysterious top laner is .
  - Yeah  I think it s just to tease
- - Hrmm . Does the nightfall bonus affect crucible rep gain

  - Just having a password would solve that .
- - I do nt know who to take seriously  a guy called bubba or a guy called cow head .
  - I do nt know whose side to take but this conversation was hilarious ...
- - Schadenfreude can be bliss . And seeing terrible things happen to terrible people can be as well . Just remember to keep your finances off their reach .
  - I came here to endorse enjoying a healthy bit of schadenfreude  as well .
- - They do around here too  but it s a dollar for a freaking tiny bottle .
  - Hmm  I rarely drink soda  so that may be the case here and I just never noticed .
- - I love this observation . I have no explanation for it though . Harrumph  Lawyers .

  - I imagine so . I m still trying to work it out with USPS
- - Why is everyone being such dicks to this poor guy 
  - Idk man . Haters gon na hate I guess .
- - I thought The Orwells put on a great show last Riot Fest . Would love ot see them again .
  - it is there hometown so i wouldnt be surprised if they showed up at lolla 
- - I do nt know . I used to be able to find a site that was way more trustworthy  but I had trouble finding it today . Go figure .
  - Yeah that site does nt look reputable at all ; looks like it s a personal website run by just one random libertarian guy .
- - I feel like Willian is nt even on the pitch .
  - Contributed nothing  forgot he was even playing .
