  - Cam first  I imagine calendars will have a camera function before cats but its pretty unlikely either way .
- - But you can also blame Arians for bringing in and staying with Lindley instead of grabbing a better QB
  - Name a better QB in the late season who can learn a playbook  Shoot me one .
  - Dixon was in Arian s system before  which is why he was initially brought in before

- - not so much tools  but for sinks  tubs  toilets  and tile check out Construction Junction .
  - It seems that CJ would be a good spot for one tho . They could probably get tools donated . It would help sales if folks could fix more .
- - not at all . Fedor did the same thing in his prime and said he does nt look people in the eye because he feels its take energy out of you .
  - I m pretty sure Fedor looked at his opponents during weigh ins  just not the faceoff at the start of a match .
- - HOLY FUCK . I M AN IDIOT . Thank you so much  I did nt hear anything in the case so I just assumed it was empty  thanks dude 
  - Haha  glad we got you a solution . Still weird on the power supply side  but whatever  does nt matter at this point .

- - Awesome finish . He s in crazily good form right now
  - That s an euphemism . EDIT . looks like the illiterates in here have no idea what this word means .

  - It s not implied at all  it means a different thing .
- - Love needs to stop jumping into the paint  he s just hurting himself .
  - Well if Dwight would stop slamming his forearms down on peoples heads he d probably be fine .

  - Yes ... is nt that religion  A belief 
  - It s circular . And yes  I would agree that religion is a series of unreasonable beliefs .
  - If it s what you believe then it s not unreasonable or else you would nt believe it .
  - Reasonableness is not a personal choice . Our law system is based on that fact .
  - You mean you ca nt have varying opinions on what s reasonable and unreasonable from someone else 
- - You are wayyyyy too invested in this too quickly . It will not end well for you .
  - I left it alone  it is what it is . Thank you .

  - Oh absolutely . No one s saying he s not .
- - Social housing in Australia  That s a whole can of worms here .
  - A can of worms  How so 
- - Most spending is done by counties in the US .
  - that greatly depends on the state . In Indiana counties are decoupled from school corporations . So counties do nt spend a dime on schools .
- - Never thought about that before actually . For a powerlifter  it makes perfect sense .
  - Yeah I like to be able to cause my own adrenaline release without using music . Like it s all psychological but it seems to help .

  - No I replaced the hanger as that completely snapped  pretty sure its the frame thats bent in towards the wheel a tiny bit . Thanks .
- - I think Miracle Rogue was one of a kind as well . Never even heard of giants mage  is it similar to handlock 
  - miracle rogue was like the first combo deck on ladder . Its pretty cool but I didnt think it really required much imagination then . It also predates giants mage
- - Can you imagine the children of that cop seeing that video  Well  I ca nt be too mean  Hillary says we have to learn to empathize with them
  - what does this mean  Hillary says we need to empathize with who 
- - Depends . Was it hijacked and redirected  I believe that has happened .

- - Remember its more afraid of you than you are of it .
  - This advice is how kids get eaten by whales .

  - He s condemning blasphemy  the same way people condemn hate speech .
- - You spelled they re wrong . Its OK cause you retarded and ca nt help it .

- - Bad Boys  Bad Boys Whatcha gunna dooo Whatcha gunna dooo When they stick ya in da People Zoo 
  - Potential to be an awesome rap song . O
- - You ve got some clicking to do my friend .
  - I had no idea this would reach so many people
- - Yeah I thought it would be hard . Lets hope someone has an extra they do nt need and would let go for cheap .
  - Even if they had an extra  they could always get more from someone who wanted to just take the MX switches out and use those for a DIY project .
- - Nope Being a bad  selfish lover  Yep
  - Sure  but I m asking for cases where the size itself is the dealbreaker .
- - As someone who often looks through my telescope I have to say that sky is so inaccurate . So bright .
  - Well do nt forget skyrim is a fantasy RPG . Fantasy being the keyword here .
- - Does it play a tune  Just a curious newbie  sorry if it should be obvious .
  - No  but now Bioware knows what they need to do .

  - Awesome  I m glad I can pay it forward . A stranger once recommended it to me and I am so glad she did .
- - I may be wrong but he might be sad because the seat appears to have firmly lodged itself in his ass . Then again those could be tears of joy .
  - if he s into that ... I mean  more power to him

- - My dad tried to make a dad joke . He asked if this was where the dicks hung out .

  - That is the only way I could have imagined it working I guess .
- - So many questions about the state of this room . Is that a kitchen counter you have your set-up on 
  - Nope  a large desk that s covered in work .
- - That poor muzzle awareness makes me cringe . That lady officer is a blue on blue incident waiting to happen .
  - Not to mention that she uses her fellow officers as cover .
- - The alarmists ca nt seem to make any claims without lying or fiddling the figures .
  - But they seem to have the loudest voices  drowning out the voice of reason .
  - Spot on  They re a very vocal minority .
