  - Proof of concept that Mike Rowe can talk anybody into anything .
- - China I see them training all able bodied people on the off chance that they get called up
  - It s probably not even deliberate . Their second or third or fourth choice table tennis or badminton or gymnastics team are probably better than most other countries  best .

  - Hahaha  not anymore . Right after high school I did  before my anxiety really kicked in . To be real  probably did nt help my case much .
- - Does this have a scent  The color is very nice . Good job 
  - Yes it does have a scent . It is a bit hard to describe though lol . All I can say is that it is a pleasant scent .
- - Mind reading . Keeps life just interesting enough but still lets you do pretty much whatever you want .
  - Oh  And I can find out if the guy I like likes me back so I wo nt need to go through awkward rejections . xD
- - What s wrong with Oracle  It has no energy .
  - people are probably just getting settled in . raps are nt a huge draw  even with their crazy run of success .
- - No wonder he got a D. Hands down his worst mainstream movie .
  - Oh god you re one of those people huh
  - Yeah  one of those people with an opinion .
  - No . One of those people that throws around the word mainstream
- - Shocked that it has nt been vandalised to death . Nice find .
  - yeah it is kinda out the way ... York is a very picturesque town and it s residents clearly take pride in it .
- - would u mind telling me what each brings 
  - Just edited my post with the main things .
- - Holy shit  this site is perfect . How have I never heard of this 
  - Yeah  I love it . It provides everything you could need to look at .
- - Kinda like achievement hunters do  I like it  and if you re willing to do it on a tuesday or wednesday I m in
  - It s actually where I got the inspiration and the guidelines . I can do it any day .
- - Sorry for the super late reply . Did you still want this egg 
  - Yes I do give me a minute to switch games
- - Careful . Those are ancient aryan symbols for female genitals .
  - You re not wrong  but it s the thought that counts
- - There is no way he could nt have used that as his model for the pic . That is just too crazy similar .
  - It s not really that similar  the fade just makes it look that way .
- - If this is a genuine reply and not some kind of satire account  I genuinely have no reply to that level of batshit insane . Best of luck in life .
  - I m batshit insane  You re the one defending terrorists .
- - Where  I ca nt see it 
  - look at your screen from an angle or turn on night mode in RES
- - I m guessing you re a woman  If so  jealousy . Stay skinny  it ll drive her insane .
  - bring full size chocolate bars as cubicle candy . watch her grow . win .
- - what is up with the jimmy butler train around here  He s a great player  but look at his stats  they re really good but no mvp worthy .
  - His stats are pretty similar to Lillard s
- - That s a thrown vinyl with a paper cover over it . The center is orange . That s how some vinyls were back in the day .
  - People see what they want to see I guess .
- - Oh no . I d never stay there  ever . Haha . Never said that . Lawyering up would be worst case scenario .
  - Fair enough . I do agree the kid deserved anything he got . He could have killed him . Hopefully getting shot taught him a lesson .
- - It also means there are more bunnies to feed the slower Hawks .
  - That was an incredibly simplified example . It does nt actually cancel out like that .
- - Is the thing about the W  keys on the keyboards true 
  - I was nt there during the Clinton to Bush transition  but some old timers in the department said that it did happen at a few desks .
- - Wait . They re actually serious with this John Cena appreciation thing 
  - It will just be like This is your Life Rock segment only not funny and everyone will hate it .
- - I hate admitting my impatience gets in the way of my success and I m not sure if I will ever be more patient .
  - I ve got that problem as well . I give up too easily at times especially when things are nt going as quickly as I d like .
- - no its west responsibility as always . You cause chaos  you fix it suka  no one ask you to destroy country and ruin everyone life .
  - Ca nt fix an inherently broken system . Aka mostly Islamic country . Take away a dictator and they start beheading each other .
- - Hoping to kick a keg of graff this weekend so that I can rack a new cherry or blueberry cider into it . I clearly lead an exciting life .
  - Blueberry cider  Why have I never heard of this 
- - I m talking about the super deep one he took from earlier .
  - Right . I mean  really  no one should be taking those . Damian is a special case .
- - This is why I get so sick of hearing Australians complain about video game prices .
  - what  just because we earn more money than you  we should subsidise your gaming  Especially when americans dont even want to subsidise their own citizen s healthcare 
- - She s sweet  I never knew they made headlamps for dogs ; I think my dog would have a fit  She s very patient . Thank you 
  - She is wearing a human head lamp  but it is adjustable .
- - Is the first season worth watching to continue the story here  or was it meh 
  - It was really cute in a good way and was enjoyable .
- - What the hell is happening to the news 
  - I know man . I m rock hard too . That news anchor is a cutie .
- - Otherkin are the furries of the furry club .
  - Because when even furries think you re a little far-out  there s a problem .
- - I bet we could make a few by shrinking the taxi stand zones in downtown . Wellington between Bay and York in particular would be a good spot .
  - Yeah that s definitely a solid solution to the area .
- - You were written up and fired for ZB  was the SMM or FT sup written up 
  - Nope . The SMM is the worst when closing too . Pull list is never done .
- - Go buy it . You can sell it on Ebay for a lot of money .
  - Buy all of them and then hold onto them  I say . Stuff like that only increases in value over time .
  - Unless the game takes a turn for the worst and subsequently shuts down .
  - Speaking of which I still have my Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning Collectors edition .
- - You could use rsync which is a Unix utility built into OSX .
  - That wo nt back up permissions though .
- - I think the answer to your question lies in another question . Is Destiny GM 
  - he said he will date gay men so yes he is GM .
- - Where will you be working if you do nt mind me asking 
  - I ll be doing IT for one of the Big Three
- - You sound super nice but letting randos into your apt late at night  I guess it WAS your neighbor ... Glad it ended up alright for you 
  - We were drunk and not thinking clearly . Learned my lesson though
- - Hmm . I do like it  although  that may be because it reminds me of the bandits in Bleak Falls Barrow in Skyrim .
  - My mind s drawing a blank on Bleak Falls Barrow  which one was that 
- - It was nt an honest and unfortunate mistake . It was negligent . End . Stop .
  - I do nt see how that makes it less unfortunate . someone is dead and a child without a mother .
- - The Pirate Party  WTF ... Hey lets make a name that will get in our way of being taken seriously
  - Have you only just heard of them 
- - Whats wrong with being a security guard 
  - In my opinion  nothing at all . Except to high school students .
- - It s a fact that the Holocaust happened .
  - Lots of things happened . The point is that you re valuing the offense of one group over the offense of another .
- - Refs have lost control of this game so they re just throwing out techs . Fucking dumb .
  - they were just going to keep blowing the whistle until everyone calms and it becomes a respectable gentlemen s game .
- - Does your dog go to Pooch hotel in San Diego by any chance  Looks familiar  and I work there .
  - No but his brother does lol ... In fact he belongs to someone who works there as well lol
- - I appreciate it man but I m in Az . It s an online one from Wells Fargo if that helps any .
  - Yea what about wells fargo  they offering you money then Take it  Im in Los Angeles  when wells fargo lets you down  come and see me .
- - So  do you add any sugar to your koolaid or you take straight 
  - Clearly  you know all about Koolaid . It s your staple diet .
- - You got it right ... but republicans will still cry that Palin is the victim here . Do nt expect to change their minds .
  - Most republicans I know  myself included  hate that stupid harpy cunt .
- - thank you . a lot . really  fucking thank you .
  - You re welcome . Any time you need to reach out to somebody  you can message me .
- - I think the fluid is the reason he s glitchy . He s the motherboard and the fluid fried some circuits .
  - Do nt they all have fried circuits 
- - I demand recognition of the Muscovy duck  as mentioned in the Dead Pond Scrolls 
  - Behold  Unto us is a Savior Born  I bring you word of the Canadian Goose 
- - There should be a committee of HOF members who can revoke a writer s voting privilege for saying something ridiculous like this .
  - Or a test of basic knowledge of baseball history .
- - And let s face it  who is nt  less popular than I
  - My tender heart tends to start to bleed .
- - Let s not forget about ditching those atrocious bezels .
  - I would nt mind them ditching the second camera . It looks ugly .
- - Beware . There is an issue with full HD displays where buttons are too big and the game is unplayable .
  - And it s been this way for months sadly .
- - Do you know how long ago this was  I pretty much exclusively watch horror movies so maybe even like ... a date might help 
  - I m pretty sure its from within the last five years
- - I hope you cleaned urself off before you posted this lol ...
  - Hahaha yeah I did . I do nt think the dog actually pooped on me  it was probably a piece that was stuck in her tail
  - Did you taste it to make sure 
  - Luckily there was nt much that stuck to my pants  so I still have them on . And I m not quite flexible enough to get a taste
- - The answers you seek are not something anyone can really give you . It s all a big case of self discovery  no one can tell you who you are
  - I know who I am . I just ... do nt know how to convey it to other people .
- - that was the one of the ugliest skins i ve ever seen
  - But I like it it s beautiful to me
- - I agree . Ever since Puyol and Pique got old the defense has been weak . We need defensive signings as well as time for our younger players to develop .
  - Puyol s retirement killed Barca and Spain . He was captain foe a reason
- - NY Giants  specializing in embarrassing losses and Super Bowl wins . Sometimes in the same year .
  - The cycle must continue next year  The heat on the hot seat has been turnt up 
- - I did nt believe you but i do now
  - Im so confused but thank you regardless .
- - There are skunks  weasels  stoats  and coyotes in the river valley . Seen em all .
  - I ve seen moose and deer as well
- - You could also try using Google Docs as a survey instrument  if they do nt have a limit and you need more data .
  - I ll check it out . Thank you 
- - What a game Buff is having holy shit Leafs have no answer for him
  - He s a one man wrecking machine . It s awesome to watch .
- - I think I misunderstood you . I thought you were saying E-Cigs do nothing for one s chances of quitting regular cigarettes my bad
  - Nah  it s cool . Misunderstandings happen .
- - Fuck that sucks . Has Shibata said anything about it 
  - Not really sure honestly . I know it was a total accident though .
- - Better that he is in the pantry than the bathroom cabinet .
  - Truth . I probably would have had enough of an adrenaline rush to get up and deal with that .
- - Valet  I get paid to exercise . I pretty much get to make my schedule for . Plus I get so many dramatic stories 
  - How did you get into this  Is it a regular thing or sort of as you please 
- - I d say the deaths in the first book would count as a spoiler . That and the big reveal in the second book about a certain wizard .
  - You are right  one of the characters does become a walking spoiler after the first book .
- - YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH Nah  you re right . There are plenty of armor options  but they really are only available at the end of the game .
  - most of them look the same though . the whole armor mail look . they didnt let the creative art team make some real cool stuff .
- - Holy shit  Amazing prices right there .
  - Thanks man  Running out of room over here . I think I just need a walk-in like yours and I will be set .
- - That my teeth are falling out . Or tornados . Those are two big ones for me .
  - Do you live in the mid-west United States 
- - also  if your monitor works with DVI-D use that instead of HDMI .
  - If the monitor has speakers  then that may be inconvenient .
- - That s generally how it works . If you miss on a pick you better make up for it soon
  - But he has been missing on high picks for the past few years .
- - My god . And we drink that stuff  Someone alert the FDA
  - I heard there s dihydrogen monoxide contamination in every tap in the US .
- - The gardens is a Loblaws  not a Sobeys .
  - You re totally right about that . I m thinking of the cavernous Sobeys near my place .
- - What will your reaction be if those three still refuse to play defense with a different coach  I m hoping this makes a difference though .
  - Who says they ll even be on the same line anymore  lol
- - I might boycott the team entirely if we picked up Shanahan .
  - I would nt blame you  I might even join you
- - Just completed my submission . Hope it goes through 
  - Awesome . D thank you for looking . Me too 
- - Which ones have you gotten so far 
  - Got all of em now  Dark Pit and DHD were left when he came home  I let him unlock them though .
- - My main criticism of Helfrich is sometimes his play calling is laughably awful . It s not consistent enough to be the coach ruining  but it s damn annoying .
  - Frost is the one play calling and he s done a much better job this year
- - lol  whatever you say kiddo . Your stupidity will plague me no more .
  - No  what plagues you will never leave you .
- - Yes  it s very very safe . And tasty in most regions .
  - I do nt think water should be tasty ...
- - I ll try . Thanks for this help . . D
  - Do nt get discouraged  You can do it 
- - I knew she was a victim of the patriarchy the second she said she was happy .
  - Best quote ever . That s so true . Feminists are just angry upset cunts . If you re happy you re not a feminist .
- - I wo nt disagree  but they ve got more of a point than the defeners .
  - Ya  there are definitely posts I appreciate here  but sometimes it comes to the point where it s just as bad as the defeners
- - You can learn to not be awkward  you ca nt learn to be born good-looking .
  - You can learn to not be awkward 
- - Ah ok . I was under the impression you wanted to make music for the show or something . Best of luck 
  - Nope  Dream Team is my ... dream . They test the challenges 
- - Surely you could google this . Or did you want us to tell you ours 
  - Felt like saying my girth to the world and was to lazy to google .
- - I had to stop half way through and they had nt even started to explain it yet . They re so fucking annoying .
  - I do nt disagree with them being annoying  but it answered the question ... eventually
- - Can a human player place it in the container 
  - Yes  there is no rule against them putting it in the recycling bin first . If you would like clarification wait for Q and A .
- - There are all kinds of things we are nt able to experience because we do nt have an organ for it . Electromagnetic radiation or air pressure for instance .
  - We can sense air pressure you know .
- - Why is this tagged SONY north Korea  What does Sony have to do with this ...
  - Sony is communicating with North Korea via hacks and film messages on behalf of the US to broker a deal to unify North and south .
- - And then what  Will life go on as normal  Will anything change 
  - The line will be drawn in the sand that day and existence will change for us all . No one escapes this . We all get a very fair warning though .
- - Can someone tell me what color schemes the car has  I m interested in making my Turismo a peanut butter jelly car .
  - pretty sure thats the iron man color scheme
- - Tell him no matter what  You will regret not telling and your friend would hate you for it 
  - Thank you . I spoke with a friend of mine last night and she told me the same thing .
- - So let me guess . You used it before it was cool  I hate hipsters .
  - I also ate McDonald s before it was cool If that makes me a hipster than so be it
- - Pretty sure there s no transfer or gifting of origin games ... Not that I know of .
  - The code was purchased on greenmangaming but you need to go the origin website to redeem it . I will post pics once off mobile .
- - Thanks  I m definitely down to try something else  although Astrill is still OK IMO compared to all of the other VPN solutions I ve tried .
  - It s ok yeah . I mainly got it for use in gaming and it s too unreliable for that . Streaming HD can also be pretty bad now as well .
- - why should he apologize its not against TOS
  - riot has come out and said they they dont support people intentionally losing games to tank to bronze ELO they have explicitly said bronze to challenger streams are not ok
- - not gon na happen  would send the markets into disarray and lord knows we ca nt have that
  - The markets are set to tank not too long from now . We re already in the beginning of it .
- - The link did not work ... Just like communism .
  - I think it did . It s blank .
- - how do you know  there is nothing about her on the description . you are just a fuckin pedo .
  - I know that girl in real life  she goes to my school .
  - Are you a teacher at an elementary school 
  - No I just found out that her one has less security than others .
- - Thanks a lot  If I can only afford either the shoes or the jeans at the moment  but not both  which oughta be the higher priority 
  - if you cuff the pants  then shoes .
- - IT S FINALLY TIME FOR MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL . NFL SUNDAY ON SATURDAY EDITION
  - How it was in Korea for me . Sunday Monday Lunch Time Night Football
- - Wow  that s bad . I learned an abscess can happen anywhere on the body  just most common in the teeth and gums for some reason .
  - Reason is bacteria and open skin . Your mouth has a shitload of bacteria and gums cut easily .
- - Unfortunately in many cases protecting the law and my rights are mutually exclusive things . So there goes that argument .
  - I do nt know what you consider YOUR right .
- - Thank you does most of the game come translated or is this just one route  Also did the guy die or the website 
  - Just the one route I believe . The group itself died . They were in the middle of several projects when progress just stopped .
- - Psh I wish it did that to me . Nice . I m just like Ok  time to get to wor -- ooooh video games
  - Haha yea I get that too . I never said I was efficient 
- - Only if you re a real person and enjoy that kind of thing .
  - True  if you re a philosophical zombie then you re technically incapable of love . Very minimalist  though .
- - So fucking fun  This ll be a blast in the next party with my friends  great job 
  - Glad you enjoyed it  Hope your friends do too .
- - Just think about all of the third downs OSU wo nt make  Roll tide 
  - Do nt need em . Go Bucks .
- - I would gold you if I could gold
  - I see this a lot . Why ca nt you  Do you have some disability that no one else who gives gold does nt have 
- - Kyle in a bit of a stomp if I m honest
  - I thought Surfer was a high S-tier 
  - No you are correct  top of the s tier in fact ; Kyle as white lantern is above that however
  - How much higher  I was under the impression they were both top s tiers .
- - Did nt like it . She sounds even older than usual
  - What s with her and her slurring of words jeez .
- - Metal Gear Solid V. I m calling it out .
  - What   It looks awesome to me . I m genuinely interested  why do you feel that way 
- - It s just a commercial  calm down . Have some dip .
  - It s an extremely depressing commercial that can make me go from feeling pretty good to being sad .
- - So fucking niggers attack and bully white kids  You mean niggers do nt belong indoors  No surprise .
  - Tell me again the logic behind hating someone for a choice they never made .
  - I do nt hate anyone . I do nt hate rattlesnakes  but I know they are dangerous .
  - When the overwhelming majority of the black race is non violent non criminal  why do you assume the majority are dangerous  How logical is that 
- - Way to fuck up the circlejerk  Iowa .
  - We have the entire off-season to be just like this 
- - Thank you  I have added that info into the list now . . D
  - Killing it  thanks again for your work
