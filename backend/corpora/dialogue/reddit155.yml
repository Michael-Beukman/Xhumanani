  - Your tears are my fuel . Cry  cry  cry woe  the poor douchebag  unable to bash women at will 
  - Is there something about women that makes them less able to handle bashing than men  or is that just your characterization of them as a weaker sex 
  - Not less able to handle it  just no longer willing to put up with it .
  - So if they re as able to handle it as the men  then they should ignore it  like the men . Or are men uniquely tolerant

  - Only a fool would run around with the sword on show . In any of the Halo games .
  - Well it actually increases speed now that you do nt get with it tucked
  - I suppose that s the trade-off . Faster but more noticeable .
- - You betcha  And hi  . D
  - Hi to you too  I miss you guys

  - Guys I m really really concerned about this what can we do  PM ME PLEASE 
  - IDK HOW NUDES ARE GON NA HELP AT A TIME LIKE THIS .
- - Moderate just means one is willing to ignore and forget about the inconvenient parts one does nt like .
  - That seems akin to hypocrisy  from my point of view . Why do you say this is moderation

  - Slightly harder to open with risks of accidentally disconnecting certain objects  plus it may void your warranty .

  - You must be very nave if you think Western media wo nt pick this up .

  - Thanks  I actually found the tank at Goodwill and the ornament at Pet Smart .
- - There s something mildly satisfying about Alabama s logo in Tennessee colors .
  - But it s just not that orange you can sit with .
- - And obviously the first thing you need to look at is the month not the day ...
  - So you admit year first is stupid 
- - I have a new rook piercing and I ve been having trouble doing this . For some reason having my ear submerged in the water makes feel like I m drowning .

- - Shit that really happened  BRB updating wikipedia .
  - Yeah - it s totally true . I read it on wikipedia .
- - I ca nt wait to see Grier next year .
  - I think we re trying to steal a FSU qb commit but I agree with you . Grier could be a monster
- - Explains why he came off so quickly after .
  - I ca nt be arsed to finish this match I ve got GIFs to make .
- - Hahaha  I ll concede that Snape did  in fact  invent his own spells .
  - I wonder how a wizard goes about creating a spell ...
- - And you can always lose a couple pounds for him xD But the way I see it he is still with you despite the choices .
  - If I m going to lose weight  it ll be for me .
- - Dude this was so helpful  thank you so much

  - It should . It is the truth . Go get em .
- - Oh i see . The article was in English so that s why I found it interesting so internationals can also read it . I do nt speak Dutch or French .
  - That s actually a really good point . But what do you think the reasons are that Belgians are so pessimistic 
- - All these people are being jokey and sarcastic . I m facepalming at this post .
  - I m facepalming your post for thinking such people do not exist .
- - What if you have so many alcoholic beverages that you forget to click the counter  
  - then  party the night away . ca nt turn back . i do have a horrible habit of blacking out when i drink so i m trying to minimize that .
- - mm Sick people  Or fat people  There is a difference .
  - Fat people are sick - that s how they become fat .
  - Yeah theres no sickness that causes someone to gain when eating right . Buying pizza chips and coke is not from a fever .
  - Mental illnesses cause people to eat unhealthily because it increases dopamine . That s a sickness  whether or not you want it to be .
- - And Samsung screens  with Corning glass ...
  - Heck  is there any smartphone that does not have corning glass 
- - Do you have the hearthfire DLC  If so  build a house  It can get quite pricey . I recommend Lakeview Manor  near Falkreath .
  - This playthrough is the first one I ve had that . Will do 
- - Because they re all owned by the Queen  and she wo nt share .
  - Well look at the thanks they got when Britain tried to share their Empire with most of the world .
- - What the fuck did I just watch .
  - Urban Meyer being sodomized with the CFB championship trophy .
- - I wonder if Bill Simmons will stop taking pot shots at the Hawks now
  - Why does anyone listen to anything Bill Simmons says . He s just a talking head who likes to stir up controversy .
- - That is unfair . It is far more oxy and pill addled .
  - the really low property taxes  trashy full nude - full liqour tittie bars  and abundance of trailers does nt help either
- - I weigh myself directly after dinner  and then in the morning after all of the above just for kicks

  - Fortunately for him  he has a driver  and thus does nt need a license .
- - I think you should rule out IB and Ghorn ... because being able to equip both would be nuts ... realistically Id like Suros to be a legendary .
  - The new CE auto rifle actually has Suros like traits
- - but then i have to pay activation fees again
  - They can wave them . And even if they re too incompetent to manage that successfully  how much is your time worth

  - I mean we re probably going to  miss you bae
- - you guys are assholes . next year i will keep this information to myself .
  - Well I wish you had been wrong but I appreciate the leak
- - IMO if you have a rookie QB you should nt be forced to put him in that kind of spotlight .
  - Yeah but unfortunately that is what will make it more interesting  having Jameis Winston on our team might make HBO more interested in choosing us .
- - The Machinist is a pretty good mind fuck gem .
  - I do nt know  that twist was a bit predictable  and other than that I did nt feel to mind fucked .
- - I see Ninja and Yolandi are in this . That s pretty cool . Though the trailer  keeping with current trends  gives the entire movie away .
  - And now I know not to watch it . Thank you .
- - You do nt need to be an asshole .
  - No need here . Just doing it for fun .
- - That does nt look very antique . Old fashioned maybe  but not old . Still neat though .
  - It s certainly not antique . The stringing and wood are spotless . It s probably just been sitting in a store for two years .
- - Well then  we should try to get this removed from the internet ASAP 
  - Ca nt we just pause the internet for a week 
- - Someone s been reading too much Ayn Rand .
  - And someone else has nt been reading enough of ... anything worthwhile .
- - Here s the thing ... it s not raw since you ve cooked it in the launch box . Totally ready to spruce up whatever treat you d like .
  - but raw is what we call it here when you just dump straight ABV in your mouth and chase it with a liquid .
- - BTW  balo is injured  that s why he s out
  - Source  They said before the game he travelled with the team so he was nt injured .
- - Thanks thats actually a better response than what I expected 
  - No problem  If you have any questions just let me know I ve played the game far too many times to count 
- - Twitter  especially as an event is currently happening .
  - Twitter is ok  something about the format though turns me off .
- - There are lots of Europeans in this sub . Type your country name into the search bar to see the posts which are relevant to you .
  - thanks I did that but there were no relevant posts .
- - I always make everything in my hospitals pure copper  to kill the germs .

- - Are we just gon na ignore Rlyeh  And what appears to be iOWA 
  - I like that you ca nt see the representative from Rlyeh . Maybe he s sleeping 
- - What about Sam Biddle  Those tweets he sent were not related to his job .
  - Well  the complaints did nt get him fired . In fact  he got promoted . So he s got that going for him .

  - Exactly . Seems that was the point .
- - Can confirm . My friend knows someone who s uncle works at tomb raider .
  - I saw this on youtube but they took it down
- - Tried it  said it had already been redeemed .
  - Probably because of the guy who said he claimed it five hours before you came along .
- - Agreed  Especially with the increased stability perk  top that with additional super energy from String of Curses 
  - Also the auto reload after a kill feature .
- - Jesus  he has such a magnificent natural cupids bow  there is no way in hell a drag queen would downplay that .
  - My thoughts exactly . Too much on the lips .
- - I do nt even know what I m hoping for anymore ... Edit . I figured out what it was . PARDON ME  COMING THROUGH .
