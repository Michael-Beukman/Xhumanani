  - Yes he has . Was nt one of the translators of his book killed  and his publisher or something 
- - Great pictures . You had an experience of a lifetime . Thanks for sharing .
  - Thanks  It was definitely a great experience 
- - Was this a smaller  private plane 
  - Yes  small two engine private plane owned  operated  and unfortunately  maintained by Grandpa .
- - Stew  That is such an odd choice  and an overall confusing assortment of food .
  - Confusing is the best word to describe it . I just smiled and left as soon as I could 
- - I just determined  from your story  that you are white .
  - I have worked with other races who have good experiences with cops though ... Also  do you assume the cop was white 
- - My grandpa does that too . The first thing to try would be to stop disconnecting it from its power source .
  - I hope you do nt do that to your grandpa .
- - why not go out Saturday night and celebrate 
  - meh  I prefer movie night in .
- - I do nt have any questions to ask you . I just think this is absolutely fantastic . You are amazing .
  - While I m not trying to be disrespect to you or op  how does this make her amazing 
- - Oh my god  this story had me legit holding my breath 
  - I m glad you enjoyed it  Thanks for reading 
- - I do nt get that reference . Nor do I want to . Dweeb .
  - Oooo . The princess is getting mad . I better watch out  lol
- - I wonder how many muslims have declared jihad against the OP
  - The fact that you ask this question is why we should resist threats of violence and question religiosity .
- - Perk might be our best offensive option right now .
  - or you could just set more moving screens
- - I would realllllly like to know why this was reported . Haha
  - Someone seems to think that censorship is part of their job .
- - I am a Raptors fan . Enjoy watching Kobe though .
  - lol why even say that when we both know it ai nt true  There s no crime against openly supporting the Lakers . You do nt have to hide it
- - If the pastor is not eating along with you  stop and think .
  - How about if your pastor tells you to eat grass  stop and think .
- - Ai nt these guys just a class act 
  - Well  they act for a certain class .
- - Wow  you just proved what a loser you are .
  - Says the guy worried about how people use a free website with fake internet points . Cute though .
- - Same exact thing happened to me  but I was stuck on a pink ward . Do nt ask me how  but my model was walking while still on it .
  - and the thing is once you get stuck  you ca nt autoattack the minions  because the minions keep canceling your autoattacks .
- - how does that yung lean tee fit  did you off his store 
  - That one is on red bubble I think
- - Probably because the new employer has to pay more to attract you to their company .
  - The old employer is doing that to attract new people to their company because of people leaving their company for better money elsewhere .
- - I m in mobile now sorry  but it s in New condition .
  - send me some pictures when you get a chance .
- - Ok  but what about the part where Dez Bryant sprinted onto the field sans helmet to let the refs know he disagreed with the initial call 
  - That was my exact thought during the play . How is there not a flag when Dez runs out on the field to yell at the ref without his helmet on 
  - Suh was on the field without a helmet two plays later
  - Why do you have to lie  Do nt even try to compare Dez s attitude with Suh s .
- - Billions of tax dollars wasted and they ask for more .
  - The most convincing way to justify sunk costs is to sink even more .
- - You know  most Companies are started and run by stoners .
  - I love trees but not sure about that statement ...
- - Anyone who watches basketball knows what he s all about  which is defense .
  - By most metrics  he s a solid defender and nothing more . He s certainly no tony allen  ron Artest or pippen type wing defender .
- - If I had the money  I d love to subscribe to Kink.com s stuff .
  - Hell yeah . I always get a bit excited when I see something on a site that s a full clip of their stuff . It s like a special present 
- - Do nt forget the people they trapped in a burning apartment on Thanksgiving .
  - Most of those people were in the aforementioned list except for Gale the Snail . Everything that happens to her is justified .
  - Off the top of my head  Frank s landlord was also there .
  - I m still amazed they got that actor back on the show after not showing up for eight seasons
- - So if I subscribed to WSJ in September ... there s a good chance I ll have to keep paying until next September 
  - It all depends on how you signed up for it  and what is contained in the legalese .
- - He did nt miss his stop . Mission accomplished .
  - That used to be the only good thing about being unable to sleep unless I m lying down . Not suffering concussions is now another added benefit to this wretched affliction .
- - It s happened again . I started crazy splitting and stressed . Getting angry about dumb shit and fighting .
  - Be patient and calm to you . The therapy does nt work over night  you need to give it time .
- - On a side note I did learn about Japanese internment camps and about the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in my American high school education .
  - Literally every American HS student does . The ones that say they do nt just were nt paying attention or are trying to make a point .
- - I do nt work for RJ but I sure can try to help for him 
  - Oh . I thought youth did . My bad 
- - or driving a car  not only you are endangering lives of passengers but another drivers and pedestrians too

- - Can you romance other characters as a dwarf 
  - Why would nt you be able to romance anyone as a dwarf 
- - Rockets just gave up at the end . Have to wonder about their team chemistry ...
  - They were discouraged because they could nt buy a call .
- - I m super excited for this game . Both teams are incredibly interesting and fun to watch 
  - Please  for the sake of my sanity  let this game be exciting ...
- - What exactly causes these  I ve played for years now and it has yet to happen to me .
  - Playing too hard through an amp that is set too quiet . It s never happened to me either .
- - So Camp is nt autobiographical  I thought that some of the tracks  especially Outside  were about Donald Glover s actual life .
  - It s both . The kid represents an exaggerated take on Gambino s life . He mixes The Boy s story with his own life
- - This article was published half a year ago .
  - I must have been busy washing my hair that day .
- - I wish Eric Andre pranking Bobo had been on the list .
  - Yeah ... we re not taking any calls from the south right now ...
- - I m doubly impressed that you managed to identify why your dog was doing what she was doing in the first place . Good work 
  - A lot of dogs use that method to cool down .
- - This has been reported so many times  I think most people know about this .
  - I just searched this up  literally no one else has posted about it . Neither have I ever seen another talk about it .
- - Are you still selling him  I would love to buy
  - I am indeed still selling . What s your offer 
  - That s fine then  I added you and can come over whenever you re ready  . D
  - Will add and be opening the gates .
- - Running from a morally bankrupt English teacher no doubt
  - I love this comment more than I should .
- - I wonder how big of a lightweight platform you could build that would let a person ride on the clouds  now that would damn interesting .
  - Mmm  clouds are nt actually buoyant or anything  they re really just a bunch of wet dust floating around  might as well call the platform a kite .
  - Well if you spread it out over the whole cloud  and made it really light  a person could stand on it .
  - Really light as in literally lighter than air .
- - Hahah oh boy  Glad you found it
  - I ca nt wait to try it out 
- - Illegal immigrants do nt have any access to welfare . Your entire argument is based on a false premise .
  - The extent to which illegal immigrants can successfully claim to be refugees is vastly different the further you get from areas of Europe most accessible to immigrants .
- - you could give it away  . D
  - Do nt have to worry about this anymore  I lost my wallet 
- - This is good news . The sooner Chip Kelly is out of the division  the better .
  - Yea it ll help out the Giants and Cowboys a lot
- - Is there someone hiding in there and touching his balls 
  - Its like seeing a ghost appear ... and touching his mighty balls
- - I d love to see a build log if you have one .
  - The last few builds took many iterations to get the mounting correct  so did nt document . I ll do so on the next build . Lots of CNC work .
- - The kingpin should nt be sticking out the baseplate that much . What trucks are you riding 
  - It s not exactly digging in  but if I tightened anymore it would  I ll post a pic tomorrow
- - I like him  just like I like Chael and McGregor ...
  - Yeah those guys are great . JJ is nt trying to be a heel  he just is .

  - Meant to be response to PM . Was nt mine  but do nt want to mess him up . Thanks .
- - Have you already beaten the game  All companion quests disappear after defeating the final boss .
  - Nope . I currently have other companion quests open .
- - YES . Thank you . Now I can reread it .
  - favorite it or bookmark so you do nt lose it again . Bad things happen to good people who do nt remember that rule .
- - May be copied from a Tumblr post but she does look rather D  to the E  to the L I C I O U S .
  - She probably has one eye or something .
- - Agree Brighton Road should be fine  you can also use Riverdale Road .
  - Thanks  I think Riverdale looks like the best bet .
- - Actually this project has been in the plans for some time now . In fact  they ve recently announced the proposed budget and planning .
  - Not really too surprising  with the passive-aggressive oppression from russia s ruling class  a revolt is inevitable .
- - Blue steel looks almost the same in all conditions  so I thought that you might be interested anyways . But gl and thanks for the answer
  - Yea I saw a video and few pics . It looks good  but a little different what I m looking for I guess .
- - Ah  guess we re looking for a different answer then car  Lol
  - Oh  yeah  we do nt stick stuff to our cars . Just seems wrong to sticker up a nice looking classic car .
  - Decal  but cars cool too . What if i dont care about my car  Lol

- - everyone has a pricetag . even jesus .

- - Phew  I was starting to think they  must have somehow deleted them lol
  - I just wanted to put the word out but do it quickly .
- - Also I used to cut my own bangs so I guess this stands as evidence of that .
  - I still do sometimes . At least you grew out of it .
- - American of Mexican descent in good ol California .
  - What s Mexico s favorite national sport  ... Cross Country .
- - watch gameplay of each game on your mind  then just pick based on your opinion . Thats my advice .
  - Yeah but I would nt trust gameplay videos because they ll most likely pick out any un-fun  boring  and buggy parts of the game .
- - Or you could just say if you already know to stop someone finding a different answer .
  - The search bar exists for a reason . The answer has been given in every single one of those posts .
- - But ... but ... how will we continue without you 
  - It ll be difficult  I know . But you ll cope .
- - Because you do nt need one . Was that terminology too difficult for you 
  - Who are you to say what I need or do nt need 
  - A pointless rifle being among the top .
  - Lots of things in life are pointless  but you still own them .
- - And he s also an asshole  apparently . Enjoy the constant wet dog smell .
  - Eh  he s so clean by this point that he does nt usually smell to bad . The wet paw prints everywhere annoy me way more .
- - This one s pretty good . I d say go for a velcro . If it wo nt work well - sew it .
  - Thanks for the input  It might be a while till i buy it anyway  so I ll still keep my eye out for something better .

  - and its downfall will be women and education

  - Yeah  Not all of us are fat .
- - Not unless you want guaranteed shared poverty and a degenerated workers  state .
  - Good thing I do nt Let s stick to capitalism
- - Try plugging in  then removing some headphones . My MBP does this from time to time after I remove it from my Henge dock .
  - Wow  It worked . Dunno for how long though .
- - Message me if you re still into this .
  - Hey  I m still into it .
- - you could try getting more mollies from what ive seen they like to have other mollies around .
  - I may just find a new home for him . I have two fry who are almost ready to move to this tank  and expecting another batch any time now .
- - I still watch Episode I ... ca nt miss Darth Maul
  - All he did was leap around a desert for a minute and then leap around a power station for a few more minutes  all the while in silly devil makeup .
- - Home made edibles is like people changing their own car oil . You know it s done right 
  - And done to your own specifications . You want medicated sloppy Joe  Done . Pizza  Done . Cake  Done .
- - I must be the only weirdo whose voice didnt change a bit
  - Mine either  but then  I do nt like being told what to do  so I m contrary on principle .
- - You took took Royal Caribbean . That s where you fucked up . Got ta go Disney and got ta go off season .
  - I went Royal Caribbean for my honeymoon and loved every minute of it .
- - The Stars  PR team is the best in the league .
  - The Stars PR team is debatably more effective then the Stars
- - Put ANY QB on the offense that the Ravens had the year after the Superbowl  I d say yes .
  - Lets not talk about last year  it was just sad .

  - Context  dude . If you re talking about your personal or political enemies  yeah  you probably are .
- - I m not a fan . Be bald . Looks way better  IMO .
  - Definitely . And maybe grow a beard if you really want hair on your skull  but do nt waste money on a transplant .
- - I d be interested in the Diddy Amiibo and Sacred Stones  are you sure you could make the trade this time 
  - Yes  I ll just PM you now with a picture .
- - nearly infinite room for tidal generators in the ocean
  - Tidal generators need a narrow passage for the water to channel through . I m pretty sure you ca nt just put them out in the ocean
  - I think I am getting the name wrong  but the tech has been around for a decade and uses the constant waves to generate electrics
  - Wave power  Still needs to be relatively close to shore so you can send power back
- - You know for a fact that you can get AIDS from a horse  Please tell us the story behind that one ...
  - Well  after being mounted by a stallion  he needed band aids .
- - I was asking for a good spanish stream but I found one in hd Quality . I do nt understand germany language but thats Ok .
  - Sabemos que estas pidiendo por un stream .
- - Again that is Josh choice to make  their are ways to help better than what Ellis did  publicly humiliate him on air is not the right way to do it
  - This argument is a year old at this point but that s just the way the show works . It s the way it s always worked .
- - So trans can never do bad things  How does this paint all them to be like her  Funny how the victim in this situation is being ignored
  - Fine  you win . I just REALLY hope that the Disney Princess situation is nt repeated when this comes up .
- - The point of the locks is to prevent spoiling in that by editing the map people can find all the good loot spots and hidden locations within seconds .
  - And also you said hidden locations  so there are teleports in the game so you can spoil by doing that too within seconds
- - Possibly the worst use of dunks ever .
  - I m pretty sure mpc can wear his dunks better than you ever could
- - Well done man a witty and original post  where do you get your ideas from 
  - Not sure if sarcasm or genuinely thinks this is nt a repost ...
- - Rollins  You should be grateful you got such a beloved superstar 
  - At first  I was  but then I realized he s only good in speed .
- - I m glad things are looking up for you today  I know you have not been having a great time at life recently . YAY for a good day 
  - Thank you . I m trying to reset my wiring and get excited about things that really have an impact on myself .
- - But you should target needs before just good players .
  - Thats how you miss out on hall of fame players ... you take the talent
- - Screw the idea that you can only uber Soldiers  Heavies  and Demos .
  - Spies and other Medics work well . Good snipers too .
- - Speaking of the effects . Where do you learn how to ride a fly 
  - You mean an ant  He can control ants  so I assume he just commands the ants to try to fly steady enough that he can stay on .
  - He can . Control . Ants . Ugh .
  - That s more or less a giant part of the character for half a century now but whatever .
- - Anyone on tumblr or SRS will tell you school shootings happen because of white male entitlement .
  - Yeah  well  SRS is trash .
- - So happy for BigDaddy and Misery  can definitely see this team going far the next TI .
  - Based on their results vs Fire  Come on  at least wait till they play a decent team before making such statements .
- - He s just a BEAST to play with or against .
  - The rougher it gets the more he likes it

  - What s a reasonable price for maintenance 
- - you ll be back to working at McDonalds if you do nt pass that drug screening  hopefully you have taken it already  frient .
  - None required as far as I know . Not to mention it s a start up .
- - Kayfabe Ryback is now re-reading The Secret .
  - Rusev is now scanning the roster sheet for a new fued .
- - Our two subs have actually been pretty tight the last few seasons . Maybe do nt be so thin skinned 
  - All of the new users are nt aware of the bond we had going . Kinda bums me out .
- - SHUT THE FUCK UP PIERRE  Sorry  its a reflex whenever I see his phallic shaped head .
  - That s why I m listening to the CBC feed
- - What happened  Did she catch it with catnip under its bed 
  - She did nt like the hat for some reason .
- - The hype is the fact that you can have the putter for a long period of time and it wo nt change too drastically
  - That would make sense . If they ever invented a plastic that never got beat up that would be the day .
- - Yeh I did  i just ignored the propaganda and looked at the cost and the illegal means that funded it and law that does not authorize it
  - So you d rather have air quality like what they have in China 
- - I call it the Mewtwo ball for this reason .
  - I call it the MLady Ball  as it looks like a pair of panties .
- - I m gay and a moderate because the far left has taken it s turn to lose it s collective fucking mind as of late .
  - Im heterosexual and a neutral since neither side even had to start .
- - I love eating lemons . So tasty .
  - I ca nt do it . Too sour  and I legit make the pucker face .
- - PB will block a list of known servers which monitor filesharing . Blocks them from being able to communicate with your computer .
  - Peer block has nt worked in years .
- - No  but new growth will cover the fishing line and still probably will look nice . Work with what you got  you know 
  - He would probably be better off using plastic grid and establish moss on that first then attach the grid to the plastic .
- - Nothing sexier than a man who takes care of himself . Period .
  - Actually there is . a woman who takes care of herself .
- - wait you recomend tribe  but leave out midnight marauder as well  Cmon
  - Midnight marauders is a good album  but low end theory is much better in my opinion . Both are great albums though
- - That s what I like to hear . Worth buying the Early Access game on steam or better off waiting 
  - Since you re a DK fan already  just get it now ...

- - How do people make these  I m honestly curious 
  - Just like the music remix type things  you mean 
- - I guess at this rate  wukong is going to get attacker and pandora is going to get balanced .
  - Somehow when I hear attacker  I have a feeling Wukong would be the one with extra row .
- - Man  as a Pats fan  I wish these dolts were in the AFC
  - I m going to be so mad if the Lions win and we do nt get to play one of these teams
- - Why does this qualify as sustainable  or were you just looking for a marketing buzz word to use  Is it made out of sustainable materials 
  - I think he meant economically  as in not prohibitively more expensive than regular packaging . still a stretch  though
- - Can you give some sort of context here 
  - Sorry  the song played as she is walking out
- - Their buffalo chicken is delicious  but huge and cheap too 
  - Yes it is fantastic . Thirding this recommendation .
- - when her IG pic so fire you do a push up
  - That s his best tweet yet cause it s the only one I can really relate to
- - needs delver . also  this is nt for competitive play right 
  - I would like to have it for competitive play . Can you elaborate on what it needs exactly  Or what you think it needs 
- - Thanks . I m liking it so far . I m thinking I might pick up another one of their knives sometime . What Cold Steel blades do you have 
  - I have a Super Edge  a Voyager Medium  a Voyager Large  and also a Thai machete . The medium Voyager is my EDC knife .
- - OP cross-posted this from there  it s currently the top post . Even used the exact same title .
  - I know  I saw it there first . Just directing people to the sub .
- - I do nt see this ending in anything other than Jones absolutely dominating Cormier . Why we re getting this instead of the Gus rematch I ll never know
  - Because Gus already fought for the title and fell short . Back in line .
- - This is me when basically anyone cries .
  - Same  I ca nt imagine how I would react if I saw my mom crying ... Actually I think I might start crying too ...
- - Mostly  it s because you suck .
  - I only suck on dicks . Dicks and lollipops .
- - Sigh ... I miss the customer always being right .
  - Except the customer is nt always right . Ask anyone who s worked retail .
- - This is my favorite dr who . When Vincent is in the art gallery and breaks down crying .
  - I cry every time I watch it .
- - Would nt that apply to pretty much every major franchise 
  - No  not every city prefers basketball to football and also has several major universities with world-famous sports programs .

  - They re in your local phone book . Give them a call .
- - I know what you mean  I still got ta give you shit .
  - Have I told you lately how much I hate you 
  - I m waiting for the day an axe comes sailing out of the darkness and sinks deep into my skull .
  - Your legacy will be epic and I m sure the insult that caused the final blow will be even moreso .
- - I think the Green category should be added 
  - You get one Jeff Green use him wisely
- - Crunchyroll is legal  but the scans do nt come out as quick
  - They ca nt release the manga before street date in Japan  they are released on the same day as in Japan IIRC .
- - What is the purpose of the loop floating around the filter output 
  - Keeps the floating plants from getting sucked under by the filter output . Otherwise they get stuck down in the other plants .
- - I d like to see him go to green bay and play with Rodgers .
  - I would nt like to see that .
- - Wait ... You could watch the game on GCL  It was blocked for me ... Granted I m in San Jose ...
  - I live in LA so it would have been blocked for me  but I m still on holiday in Latvia  so I got to see this one on GCL
- - I doubt you ll ever reach the nether regions here  but god luck with your startup 
  - hmm where are you located  and thank you 
- - That was a really good first period .
  - Kings again allowed a goal in the first five shots . I m postponing judgement .
- - No  I d rather be dead than to have a bill .
  - That s your prerogative  I guess . Still  caskets are nt cheap either
  - Yeah  but someone else gets stuck with that bill
  - Not necessarily . Depends on the value of your estate .
- - We ll be fine next year . Harbaugh was good  but I m sure we ll find a great replacement . Everything is going to be okay .
  - There s no way our owner would be the source of the leaks that pushed out our demonstrative but quite possibly genius head coach . Nope . Not possible .
- - I m planning on getting this kinda high as soon as I get home from work . So pumped .
  - Make sure you get a can of whipped cream so you too can be whipped cream head
- - Great to hear she s on the road to recovering . Wish you both all the best of luck and health in the new year .
  - Thank you so much . I really appreciate that . All the best to you and yours in this coming year as well .

  - Nope . You can get hit by a car  falling debris  lightning  attacked by wild animals  mugged ...
- - He-Man . Masters of the Universe  I wan na see a real life battle cat dammit 
  - There was a Masters of the universe movie a long time ago but it was awful .
- - Wow I never heard that quote before but it is inspiring  thank you for responding
  - You re welcome . I m glad it resonated with you .
- - Giannis will never be more than a slightly above average NBA player
  - Ill fuk u up  swer on me mum
- - If they ca nt stop the bots in WoW  they ca nt stop them here . I ve seen bot spam in every MMO I ve ever played ...
  - Have nt heard of spam in Hearthstone .
- - And throw in Darwin s abilities to boot  and Superman would be screwed
  - When the Hulk attacked Darwin his body just decided the best course of action was to teleport him miles away . The same thing would probably happen if Superman attacked him .
- - Did nt OP just translate the French article to english for the jester one 
  - Last I knew the changes made were almost immediately reverted . I did nt look much into it past that .
- - Actually  it s the opposite . Reverse sear is cooking it low first and then searing it  the reverse of how it s usually done .
  - Yeah I reread it and realized that . I edited my comment
- - So many people on this sub would be raging about spoilers .
  - They can if they want to  but once a comic s been out for a month  we do nt require spoiler tags .
- - Not trying to be a naysayer here but is there a legal issue with using an emulator to make money 
  - It s a legal issue whether or not you use it to make money .
- - Does anyone know what they will look like  Cant seem to find them on the workshop
  - They are most likely valve made patterns  so we ll have to wait till someone unbox one or the update is released
- - Chronic Fatigue Syndrome . It makes functioning day to day very difficult .
  - I had sleep apnea that gave me something similar . I would fall asleep while talking to people . It was indeed pretty awful . How do you cope 
- - Smoke out Wednesday at Oblivion for Smoked Wings I also love The Sloppy Taco Palace s wings .
  - Ahhh how could I forget STP  I liked it better before the construction . Great wings for sure though .
- - Never been there but from what I can tell there is little to do .
  - You mean besides the drugs drinking and sports  Nope . Same reason you find so many athletes from the middle of nowhere .
- - fuck that I do nt want Jameis . I rather have the Bears address a need on defense . Shane Ray comes to mind or Shaq Thompson .
  - I d much prefer Fowler to Ray .
- - You obviously do nt read on the train .
  - No I do nt take my books anywhere for obvious reasons
- - Clomid can kick start your balls . What does is he giving you 
  - He did nt clarify the dose yet ...
- - collect it all and put it on their doorstep .
  - Lol that s the first thing I thought of doing  but then decided I should handle it like a grownup . I still might do it though .
- - Wondering if it s possible to use spotlight search  go to settings  and turn off Find My iPhone that way ...
  - Hmm I never tried that  hope this works instead of having to go into safe mode
- - Everything about that cock loving comment made me laugh 
  - Once I get more familiar with this cock I will write a review
- - If I write a narrative  would you like to create a comic 
  - If you have a complete script  or a solid start on a strip  I would be interested in taking a look at it .
- - CS . GO  you ll hate it then love it .
  - One of the games I do have . Probably my favorite fps
  - So basically you lied in your title 
  - Op today was confirmed a soft bundle of sticks .
- - I think I m missing something . How else would you get one if you do nt earn it or buy it 
  - I think he means that he either bought them from Xur or through bounties rather than getting them dropped from raids .
- - Yeah let s imagine that ... Im picturing more of the same annoying bullshit just with a different target . So what are you trying to suggest 
  - Im suggesting that criticism is better spent on worthy targets .
- - If it s so good to be unemployed  why do people drag their asses to work every day 
  - Wish it  want it  do it
- - Well we do have much more depth than a lot of other teams .
  - Because we draft well and prepare for these kinds of things . And happen to coach players way up .
