  - I think that says more about the calibre of wrestlers he s facing . If he faces someone like Swagger he ll win with a single AA
- - But if we were to trade away Haula  Coyle or Granny  who would we use to replace them  AHLers 
  - Probably for now . But if we do trade them I am assuming we are upgrading at the goalie position  which would certainly be worth it .

- - So Baltimore is going to treat Brown like any other receiver  Do they want to lose 
  - Nobody in our secondary could cover him anyways
- - Or  just maybe  we re dealing with a lot of injury issues . The old guys barely missed any time .

- - But meat is nt disgusting . I m intentionally missing your point to illustrate how asinine it is .
  - i think you re just illustrating you re a blockhead . how is the point asinine 
- - The rest of mainstream philosophy is calling bullshit .
  - Any proper philosopher knows that an appeal to authority is not a proper argument .
- - Does fighting back against bigoted comments like the one she made really have to be reduced to discrediting her or commenting on her appearance 
  - I agree  OP would have been better served by avoiding talking about her appearance . The point is how people can feel freely about someone s height like that .
- - On the bright side  I found a raincoat and apparently have not been touch by water since ... Not even damp boots
  - The active negative effects are easily mitigated and not much of a problem . Bu the sound . THE SOUND . It makes me hum to try and create diversity .
- - I ca nt stand warowls voice at all .
  - see this is a common comment made  and I m just curious as to why  Considering that s his natural voice and tone he speaks with IRL .

- - That sub is like literally my freetime life
  - I m really happy to be banned tbh
- - Why is it not being used for something  It was a perfectly good stadium .

- - Thank you  would you mind if I pm you sometime with a question or two after I change some things up  Before I purchase
  - Sure  feel free to pm me at any time .
- - because being thrown over in a normal match does nt mean you ll lose  so in the rumble you try your hardest to not get thrown over
  - Hell  you d even consider it a breather .

  - Find the remote  hide the remote . Or get an app on your phone to change the channel back to the game .
- - Couple of months  I did nt know dust builds up that fast .
  - Just as a precaution  you could let it go longer but why risk it

  - Depends on the country but in most  bikes do not have right of way on sidewalks .
- - did you ever find out if the pin holes were too big

  - I love being myself by joining the latest trends .
- - Or he was getting flamed and did nt want to bother reading it .
  - Then he should take responsibility . His company released a broken and shitty game  he should face the fire .
- - Yes . On the other hand  if these people have opposite biases  some of which will cancel out  and the article will be more reasonable then both .

- - Do you have proof or is this just something you think you can claim without any shred of evidence .
  - Do you have proof that your god is anymore prevalent than someone elses god 
- - I ve always liked clothed sex  but also in a risky place . So I guess clothed exhibitionism is the actual fetish .

  - Your opinion is condescending . Nobody thinks that you are superior but you .
- - I just had to go over ghosts and their impossibility with an atheist friend . He still believes in astrology  though .
  - Just goes to show that atheist is nt necessarily an indication of reason . People can be atheists for really bad reasons .
