  - Never mind . Let s agree that we disagree .
- - No  I did nt commit that grammar crime .
  - This thread was better in its prime .
  - You mispelled rhyme  now that s a crime for which you ll serve time .
  - Your faulty usage of time in reading my sublime rhymes tickles my spine 
- - Oh but I mean just how it KNOWS exactly which character  and does nt just bring up a random furry

- - Yeah . We played awful . But regardless  fuck you Ravens . I hope Gronk smashes your entire team back to Cleveland .
  - I think we ve already had this discussion but I agree  I think the Pats are the lesser evil at this point .
  - I used to say the same until I moved to New England . The only thing sweeter than beating he Ravens is the Patriots fucking losing .
  - I did nt say the Pats are not evil ... At this point the only positive that can come out of these playoffs is seeing the Pats and the Ravens eliminated .
- - Seen it . Multiple times . Love it . Her voice even fits the old songs .

  - No  you ca nt do that . I believe kicks must be blocked on the way up .
- - Good to see that people are keeping Communion modern . I ve always thought the body of Christ could use a little more flavor to it .
  - Excellent idea - and for Christ s blood  I nominate Scotch . Scotchy scotch scotch .
- - Thank you  I ll be sure to give it a try . And also  thank you for not being an asshole like certain other people who commented this post .
  - I do nt have an iPod but I looked this up . I think it s the same for all IOS devices .
- - The same hacks have been undetected since august where have you been 
  - I ve been here a while and well aware of the hacks  it s the frequency of players using them thats on the rise 
- - Yea  I was thinking the same thing . I guess not everyone has those around ...
  - it s a really common optical illusion regardless
- - Time displaced Jeff Goldblum and Benedict Cumberbatch party with Raquel Welch instead of using their future knowledge for constructive ends . For shame  you two .
  - History will turn out however it does  but a chance to party with Raquel Welch is nt going to happen again .
- - It was the latest one they did in Seattle .
  - Aww  drat  I missed talking to her 
- - Since when does Merkel speak for the EU

  - I ll bet people continue to tailgate without their headlights on .
- - If only we could have successfully rejected ours ...
  - I wonder if the lack of leaks on yours had something to do with this leaking and the backlash .
- - Why not type out an intelligent response instead of a snide comment  You obviously wanted to reply  but instead only shook your head .
  - I would guess it s because they were at an impasse in the discussion .
- - They have to use original frames that were titled to get away with it .
  - Ah  I figured there was a catch to it .
- - This episode was one of their best . From this scene  to Mac and Dee  to the burlesque  to the best song I ve ever heard .
  - There is a spider spider spider . Inside my soul soul soul .
  - I just wan na tell you all go fuck yourselves
  - that s our que  SPIT ON THEM .
- - Gon na discuss and circle back with you eventually .
  - No problems  if you have any questions drop them here or email me . Always happy to discuss .
- - OH my god do nt be such a pussy .
  - Hey  smoking is very dangerous . It affects everyone around the smoker as well as the smoker . Besides  worrying about your health is not to be frowned upon .
- - I hope I do nt sound disdainful but is that how you view porn stars then 
  - I would assume that poster also sees porn stars as sluts . I am sure that is a common sentiment .

  - Thanks  I hope you managed to keep that gag reflex in check 
- - The fake laughter after every line ruined it for me .
  - Great show  but they really overused the laugh track .
- - White guy checking in here  I also ca nt parallel park for shit .
  - I d rather take an afternoon to learn than have all that extra weight in the back of my car .
- - Completely agree . I have a prominent thigh gap myself but there s just something off about those models . The one on the right has an awkward leg placement too .
  - I think they may have moved her legs farther apart in postproduction on the photo .
- - Your sex is determined by your genitals . Your gender is what you identify as .
  - Your sex is nt determined my your genitals it is determined by your chromosomes .
  - So would you call a post op trans who has a vagina a male 
  - I could call them whatever their identity asked for .
- - That s fucked up  I m gon na have to read this book now .

  - squeezing the Charmin has that effect on people
- - And fields worse . I really think CJ can only decline  so let s free ourselves now . Anything we can save I ll take .
  - We wo nt save anything . We can only lose on a trade with him . That s why you see if he can get his offense going again .
- - I can relate to this . People seem to hate blues for no reason
  - No one likes to be called on their bullshit . Being invaded by a Blue is basically evidence that the game judged you to be a jerk .
- - Am I not seeing it  Or is this just a picture of intersection with nothing else of interest in it 
  - You know what . You re right it s not as interesting as it was I thought it was this morning .

  - I try to use as many colors as I can in all my drawings
- - That photography is out of this world Are the colors just from the camera  Did you post process 
  - Definitely looks like post processing . Probably just playing with RGB curves or levels .
- - You have the best  happiest and most genuine smile I ve ever seen 
  - That s really sweet  Thank you 
- - Did you see his recent games  He deserves to do whatever the hell he wants .
  - its probably motivating him being back in the spot light and hanging out with the grills on the LANs
- - Nah I could nt do a Wii u for a PS vita  anything else 
  - Who asked you if you wanted to trade a Vita for the WiiU 
  - idk  i assumed it was you lol

- - Janitors . They do it for FREE .
  - They get paid in ego boosts  though that could come from a rush of endorphin s when they are eating a hot pocket .

  - That s like the basis of all religion . Men forming a club to justify their behavior .
- - My girlfriend s are pierced . So yes
  - Look at this guy  he has a girlfriend
- - I ve never actually gotten past the first island in GTA III  so I never really experienced the size of the map in it .
  - You should look it up  it s actually a sizable map .
- - Has Notre dame had a QB start consecutive season openers since jimmy clausen 
  - I do nt believe so . Its an unusual strategy .
- - I m not saying kale is nt good  just that the commenter above did nt make a good case .
  - To be fair  most foods taste better when combined with other ingredients and spices . Eating bare rice or potatoes is nt that nice either .
- - I feel like I ordered Coke and they brought me Pepsi .
  - So you went to see Courtney and Jocelyn came out  I ll see myself out .
- - Hello bombshell  Where have you been all my life 
  - Umm on planet Earth  Lol And hello back . D

- - Wow  you got close . Glad you are ok
  - Thanks . And Ya  it was . I just hope the house does nt burn down while I m gone .
- - Still saying bitcoin is stable as far as cryptocurrency is concerned is a bit like saying dynamite is harmless as far as explosives are concerned .

  - Could someone explain what based  means in this context  I was wondering about it for quite some time .
- - is the pp regen that good  and is there no device for that ability 
  - The PP regen can be useful since you can starve your mag then feed it when you re going to need the PP regen which activates shortly afterwards .
- - Sorry  the one farthest to the right
  - The small one is from Young Justice  the one in the old robin suite is Dick Grayson and the one in the front is Tim Drake .
- - And of course  since it was Browner  that was a penalty
  - That penalty made me sad . Was such a nice hit and heads up catch .
- - Catherine Bell  I used to have the biggest hard on for her . I feel disgusted for jerking off to JAG now
  - I had that same reaction to Greta Van Susteren .
- - Does nt matter if illegal or not . It COULD have been used for seizures a long time ago . It was nt  but the possibility was always there
  - How do you know it was nt used to treat seizures anywhere in the world before now 
- - I agree with him . The pyramid ships totally look Vex .
  - Look up in the sky on the blind watch pvp map . You see vex triangle ships invading Mars and cabal anti air shooting at them
- - Sweden does nt care  they are a gateway to Europe  through them you can go live anywhere in the Schengen s area
  - Incorrect  Sweden and the generous welfare there is what they re after . They are economic refugees that probably paid a hefty sum to get to Sweden .
- - Do you really think that this isnt planned 
  - i have no idea  is it 
- - sounds awesome . too much power for me to be responsible with .
  - Haha yeah it can get away from you if you re not careful . But it s so much fun to play with

  - First you get the sugar  then you get the power  then you get the women .
- - Who is this guy  The king of tying knots 
  - If you ever need some knots tied go to him
- - Thanks . I do nt frequent bars much  but do you think lighting a candle is permissible 
  - Many shows have candles on the tables so you can probably get away with that .
- - Maybe because she s tired of being the only one cleaning the litter boxes and doing the dishes  you dingus .
  - Can confirm . I do these and never have complaints about my free time .
- - man behind drafting Russell Wilson  Sherman  Irving  etc .

  - Got most of the classics in blu-ray  might be one or two I do nt have .

  - Thank you  it was a gift from my best friend .

- - Sort of the entire second half of your comment
  - You re going to need to be more specific .
- - Well that s pretty interesting . I feel like this is too soon to be true though .
  - yeah  I agree . just nice to see some sort of progress .
- - Jesus Christ that second scan is ridiculous . Thor could like  clap his hands kind of hard  and kill Spider-Man . Why is everyone acting like that anyways 
  - Recent Marvel event Axis inverted the minds of a lot of heroes and villains .
- - Abzan warriors with Warden and a curve topping Brutal Hordechief and some Rhinos . Seems better than Mardu .

- - is nt that the same guy that made the wolverine claws 
  - Not sure  but I d take his turbos over Ford s Ecoboost .
- - Just remember that your wife needs that same time away once in a while .
  - She s usually too drunk to go anywhere .
- - Absolutely loved Gavin s view of Michaels splat

  - I would nt drop either . Burrows likely wont last on the top line for long
- - I wish it s division reset Imagine the tryhards if it would be today All those streamers  all those flamers  ragers WOW SO FUN
  - Tryhards  FINALLY  that s what rankeds are for .
- - Sally Sitwell  that is my first impression . You do look fun and outgoing .

  - I ca nt leave my apartment in the morning without taking my coffee dump . Best part of waking up
  - Did nt know that s what folgers was made of  I always thought it was coffee beans but it makes more sense now .
- - You forgot to drink it yourself first .
  - Then stick your dick in the charging port and piss .

  - yeah that works  its all a matter of preference
- - Do you live in the States or in Europe 
  - I live in Europe  Bulgaria to be more specific .
- - You know Rinaldo has wanted to let that out for awhile .
  - I picture him being kept in a cage when not playing . And they keep running sticks across the bars to keep him agitated .
- - No it s not if standing up . There s plenty of info that proves you wrong .
  - Link please . I m new to this  is there an article or something I can read about cancelling reloads and resetting recoil like this  Like in what s faster
- - Imagine mine . It would look like a Jackson Pollock painting .
  - Or the inside of Starlord s ship .
- - Did you see me when I was waving at you 
  - Oh that was you  Did nt recognize you with the new haircut .
- - Obligatory PC is better blah blah blah I think you should get it if you want it

  - Ah  that sucks . Could you buy a wireless keyboard and mouse and connect it to the tv 
  - I probably could ... Can i use console controls on a pc 
- - Made by people who professionally try to rip you off .
  - With the overhead and efficiency of a communist banana republic .
- - When you re hungover and coach is still making you play .

- - All these comments gave me cancer  I guess I should nt have expected a voice of reason in a fight sub .
  - You should have expected the voice of a screaming girlfriend instead .
- - Sure it was not KVA Recon item reward 
  - No it was definitely the supply drop challenge
- - Wh did you recieve kill yourself messages  wtf 
  - Someone decided that they do nt like me  yay .
- - Your friend will most likely go to jail .
  - That is pure opinion . OP tell your friend to hire a good criminal defense lawyer . Putting someone like him in jail is certainly a counter productive measure .
- - It looks like the eye lashes were put on with MS paint
  - That mascara gives me the willies . It looks like if she dared to close her eyes  her lashes would be glued together .
- - Ugh Pete Carroll sucks  hes way overrated . If hes so amazing what happened with the Jets and the Patriots teams he coached for like a year .
  - One year is not nearly enough of a sample size to base a judgment on .
- - Gift it to someone who would benefit from it .
  - I already sent out a snapchat to my friends and no one needs it so I feel like it would just go to waste in one of my drawers .
- - except you have to prove it with a copy of your pay stub  and I believe tax fraud is significantly more expensive to deal with than a minor ticket .
  - Black market jobs have pay stubs  And what of cash tips 
- - What if the shot was pulled over ice and then poured over the cold brew 
  - That will cause a temperature shock and the result will be a very bitter taste . From what I ve experienced at least .
- - It s been a while since I played Mass Effect .
  - Well you have to remember all the details exactly or else it does nt count

  - A fine gentleman ought to have standards  old chap .
- - Nothing to see here  move along .

  - Perhaps I meant Illuminati . Just the dialogue between Franklin and Tanisha at his house .

  - Mk . I wonder if there are any prerequisites that I need before attempting ... Anywho  thanks for the idea . I probably should do that ...
- - It s an enigma to those who never see it .
  - Right  that s why it worked so well too when it was first introduced .

  - when you see the pic you have that part already in the head
- - that video was a bit harsh on the eyes
  - I love how she has to lay down and rest at the end of it
- - Sometimes I m actually not sure if that whole sub is a circle jerk or not .
  - I think the mods have resigned to it being an extension of MCJ .
- - Ok  you have shown your age here . That is a report and a block for you little fella .
  - You little sissy  go ahead  tell .
- - Guess he does nt have a wood burning fire .
  - Do nt all fires burn wood  Not a physicist here .
- - I ca nt wait till Hamhuis is back on the ice . I miss seeing him out there
  - Hopefully in the next couple weeks . It s been so long 
- - I agree but I m scared more generally than Dr. Ali seeking legal advice . Scared for the world .
  - The world has endured far worse than what you and I are witnessing right now my friend .
- - but for the time being we just keep letting them murder innocent people  right 
  - We re not letting anyone murder anyone . They do nt exactly ask for permission .
- - By definition of how torrenting works  you are uploading .
  - I imagine he meant the original source uploader .
- - Being fucking alone  but to scared to talk to anyone  but also being a dick to everyone . Sucks
