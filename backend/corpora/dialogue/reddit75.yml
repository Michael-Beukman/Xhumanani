- - Cellphone chargers generally do nt have lights .

  - I ve never seen a phone charger with lights .
  - You know how anecdotal evidence works  right  It does nt
- - I do nt want to break up a set . What about the typhlosion holo 
  - Yep I could do that . The Typhlosion seems to sit around the same value as the Articuno . Would you do a straight trade - one for the other 
- - I heard they are great for running xbmc
  - They re also great for collecting dust somewhere in my house that is unbeknownst to me . And probably a great paper weight .
- - I like it and I am looking forward to it  but I am concerned that all of those overlay graphics are going to be pointless clutter .
  - They usually show an action multiple times  I assume the overlay will usually be one of many replays .
- - You guys are nt taught basic astronomy or geography 
  - I do nt know where OPEN went to school  but I was definitely taught more than basic geography and astronomy

  - Almost a mile through the woods . She was in shorts  a T-shirt  no shoes .

  - Lol u the dumb one for thinking she d buy oranges from Portugal to bring to China
- - Should have won the league  god knows how we did nt .
  - Depressing is nt it  Such a shame that side was broken up  would ve been one of Wenger s best ever achievements imo
- - As you get older  the time starts to go by faster .
  - What if as time goes by it just continues to go faster for everyone  but babies just do nt know any different 
- - Amid going to hell for laughing at the fact that he made his mom make him a sandwich 
  - The Princeton grad tells him mom to get him a sandwich . And she does .
  - If I tell my mom I want a sandwich she ll tell me to watch my fucking mouth and get out of her house
  - That s all  So lucky . My ear would be ringing while I brought HER a sandwich .
- - Not really creepy so much as WTF      I d be laughing my ass off personally .
  - I was ok until it turned around . It s like a ripped Cabbage Patch Doll  and those things freak me out .
  - Cabbage patch dolls in general  Or only the ripped ones .
  - Cabbage Patch Dolls in general . I have nt seen too many ripped ones .
- - No  I do that because it s what I think of your comment . There s no reply more legitimate than the truth .
  - It s past your bedtime  kid . Let the adults talk .
- - Google searched image  found several stories she had reported on  and the same picture of her you showed us .
  - Did you get a name though  NO  exactly . STFU and dive a little deeper next time .
- - Can we get a gif of that last play 
  - I second that . I would love to see that silly play again .
- - take care guys this does seems a little too good to be true and there is no proof to back up its not a scam
  - It sounds like the regular southern european callcenter deal to me . The gotcha is the low pay for a full-time job .

  - Good on you brother  let me know if you re having troubles .
- - He just want to make sure that you are absolutely sure he did nt fuck it .
  - Or maybe he did ... In a very strange way
- - GIVE ME YOUR EARRINGS AND YOUR EYEBROWS NOW OR THE PEACOCK GETS IT
  - The brows are much better now actually  I forgot to pluck them so they were kinda unkempt . Found my lit mirror the other day and was like ERGH 
- - He s saying that his partner should do something because she is a woman . That s sexist .
  - apparently you have a lot more information on this particular case than i do . i can not extrapolate this kind of detail from his question .
- - I was under the impression that it would use that information to decide what satellites to listen to 
  - Correct  which is helpful  but not required for functionality .
- - Still significantly more expensive than a land route .
  - That s why the majority of trade and overwhelming majority of long distance trade is done by ship right 
- - Just imagine the smell . Hundreds of condoms filled with aged semen . Delicious .
  - Oh it s more than just that ... You get used to it after a while .
- - If you laugh at jokes that are about domestic abuse you re a horrible person and that s all the evidence I need .
  - Lol . Good job proving my point .
- - It has to be coded with the square brackets and the fake address . This line will  when properly entered  not even appear in your comment .
  - Would nt that mean that Elon manually summoned Marvin 
- - Students telling the teacher to fuck off .
  - Not just teachers  but everyone s General F U attitude .
- - Oh same here ... tons of ups and downs ... staying focused on the UPs 
  - Yes maam  I m trying as well 
- - Who says Defender is the worst PvP subclass 
  - To be fair it s not too good in anything but Control and Clash and that s only if you have the full stack .

- - Guess I ll be WTing my breedject boxes . Hope to see a Mawile soon

- - Who remembers Beetle adventure racing  Edit . beetle
  - I still have it . Played it a couple months ago .
- - it wo nt be the same without cousin Eddie .
  - I bet you could use a cool one ...
- - Pacific Rim . It was a good movie for what they marketed it to be . giant robots fighting against giant monsters .
  - I heard it dubbed Two hours of robots twatting aliens   what s not to love in that  
- - If you re attractive  he s flirting .
  - If you re unattractive  he s probably still flirting .
- - Most of the time seeking too far in a video reloads it entirely ...
  - No hit the replay button . That works .
- - Rob Lowe has turned out to be a funny dude .
  - He won me over with Parks and Rec .

  - He s been arguably our best player today Edit . Wilson  I mean
- - Do nt guns have a safety mechanism to keep shit like this from happening . Are nt cops supposed to be trained in gun safety 
  - The ultimate safety is the handler of the firearm . If you do nt point it at yourself and pull the trigger you ll be fine .
  - Well  he did nt point it at himself .
  - Then how did that bullet end up in his stomach  Guns do nt point themselves .
- - Wow  for all the dumb shit taxpayers do pay for  this is your gripe 
  - Easier to fight the little guy than the military .
- - now if the refs would man up and give the away team a powerplay that would be great
  - They have nt really missed anything this game  and Calgary is playing clean .
- - You re a real MVP  Grizzy .
  - I m almost positive I heard them announce Grizzy as the fourth star as I was leaving the arena .
- - He d probably just end up working for Brazzers .
  - As someone following his twitter prior to his face run  this comment was hilarious .
- - Nah you re wrong . I m pretty sure I would nt forget my team playing in a bowl game .
  - Yeah they canceled bowl games this year .
- - Agent Venom actually had an entire volume dedicated to him  and the longest running Venom ongoing title . It was incredibly good too 
  - Ohhh . I ll look it up . Got my bday in February so I wann get a metric tonne of comics . D
- - Anyone else clock this  Have nt seen it yet .
  - Yesss . Mags and Joslyn were also shown
- - Natures valley bars are a pregame snack enemy of mine .
  - Get the crumbs in your pads and you might as well leave for the night .
- - I was hoping this would be a sub .
  - Seriously . One of yall hoes need to get on it 
- - What about Kaman  Lopez out longer than expected 
  - Joel Freeland is out for at least the next two weeks which leaves just Meyers Leonard to back up the center position .
  - Meyers Leonard dominating  and yet the Blazers are greedy and want more 
  - ONE GAME  He s definitely not going to continue this trend .
- - Managed to log into the chat now  gon na play an ARAM first to see if there s lag . Keep tight  I hope you can log in soon 
  - Grats  Good to know you made it back in 
- - Second go round felt much nicer than the first . Everyone else has covered what I would criticize .
  - Thanks for the feedback man . Btw  I ve started on my verse for our track  hopefully I can get it done soon .
- - For some reason I see this as mostly applicable to security footage .
  - That s what I was thinking . With all this talk of cops wearing cameras I wonder if this sort of thing is inevitable .
- - It s never too late to cook .
  - Well making garlic butter was very easy It s pretty good . I think I might add more garlic and add it to meat . That sounds good 
- - Please  keep burning the timeout FSU . You wo nt need them because Oregon will keep piling on points and the game wo nt be close . Great Job .
  - Yep . game is getting away ... Flair up .
- - I was thinking you were gon na say  surrender it  but this is better . More subtle . I like it .
  - Yeah plus yours would nt even make sense .
- - I got the icebreaker from the nightfall and I have been waiting months so he will most likely be selling it 
  - That d be crappy luck for you  but good for me . But here s hoping we re sharing IceBreaker memories soon . Haha .
- - Why do nt we lower the poverty line  We could lift the majority out of poverty just by doing that
  - Hitler sort of did that by saying that Jews  women  gays etc were nt included in employment figures . Unemployment almost disappeared 
- - kevin tried to pull out the chair  didnt work ...
  - Perkins isnt quick enough to fall for that
- - quite sunny outside for late at night imo
  - It s called lamps and brand new white shades .
- - I am a physician . This is more common than you think .
  - I assume something that shape will just poop out 
- - There s a urine spray to pick up at the pet store . It s kind of like Febreeze . Give it a try and see if it works first .
  - We re trying that right now . Hopefully it works
- - The sides and rear end was great  but the front end of those mustangs was awful .
  - I actually disagree . I owned one so I m definitely biased . I loved that car so much .
- - A perfect microcosm of UCLA s season . Some terrific play  some terrifically shitty play  and a whole lot of penalties . Great game KState
  - We re not so different  you and I
- - I m sorry Joe Buck  but that was a really dumb statement . Also I m not sorry .
  - At this point  do you honestly expect an intelligent statement to come out of Joe Buck s mouth 
- - Kurt Angle s been gone for how long 
  - Longer than he was ever in the wwe
- - Less reality than perception . If they can reproduce by fusing nervous systems  is tricking a mind really that far of a stretch 
  - Right  but they would appear different on video because mind trickery would not work through it . But they certainly do nt .
- - This is like The Sopranos  except instead of everyone being Italian-American  everyone is fucking nuts .
  - Needs to be a meme picture . NEEDS TO .
- - Sonofabitch  I just assumed this was an unpaid sabbatical or scheduled off time . Paid time off though  That s almost unheard of .
  - I know  That s what it s an amazing gift 
- - Try to use block communication when people are being annoying . Easier said than done but it really helps
  - See  that s the issue . These same people make calls  too . I m handicapping myself by blocking them .
- - I ve always liked Talon as a name for a boy .
  - That is nice . It just sounds so foresty .
- - We need some Gang Green magic right now 
  - Wrong team to try it against though .
- - You really do nt have to . It was a joke . We believe you .
  - But now I have the karma so I have to . Besides it s on the way to where I was going whether this happened or not .
- - have you deleted anything else recently  sometimes a tweak will install another tweak that it s dependent on ... so maybe ...  ...
  - Only Polus ... after it caused the respring loop .
- - Unfairly  If you drive drunk or reckless  you are fairly targeted
  - Both of those infractions carry a smaller penalty than failure to pay tickets . That s what the article is about .
- - I use coconut oil for everything  From cleaning my boots to moisturising my face to cooking chicken 
  - I swear coconut oil is magic in a bottle .
- - How to study and proper sex education .
  - This is a really good one  knowing how to study is an art in itself
- - more liek you are undervaluing the worth of removing a competitor out of the business .
  - And you are horrifically overestimating the level of corporate sabotage in the world ...
  - Just because im paranoid does not mean im wrong .
  - Just spend more money on insurance and relax . . P
- - I have tickets to the Wild game Tuesday . Maybe I should bring a book when I go .
  - may god have mercy on anyone going to the blackhawks game

  - When the modelling industry has an issue with obese models  they ll probably make a maximum too . Right now  that is not an issue .
- - Just do the raid a couple of times first to get the vex and you re good to go . S

- - Xpecial looks like he s seen some shit and is ready for business .
  - Well yeah  he was in TSM .
- - That is straight flames man  First thing I do tomorrow is stop by the local pawnshop and scope one 
  - You might have better luck just picking one up retail  but thanks man  Good luck 
- - I like this one  the rhythm of it seems slightly different . Does it have a specific name 
  - Yeah I was wondering that too  quite different from her usual stuff but I really like the metre  whatever it is .
- - That plush is so cute . Did it come with the other costumes 
  - I do nt think so . They sell all the cosplay Pikachu  and the costumes are most likely sewn on .
- - Except we dont have any way to deal with the nuclear waste
  - Yes we do . No human has ever been sick due to nuclear waste from spent fuel .
- - Reminds me of a similar game I had . Everyone was a Sniper . The bodyshots were real .
  - I played on a payload server the other day where the entirety of the opposing defending team was Soldiers with The Original .
- - If you grew a beard with that jawline ...
  - My beard is nt full yet but I have something to grow I guess . I m usually not shaved so you ll probably see with me some stubble or more .
- - Should be within the holiday return period .
  - I have trouble with their website ; do you happen to know how long that is 
- - Asides from moving the score stuff and showing the bg without overlays  can i ask what is actually edited 
  - There s also a music thingy on the left of the mania thing . Plus moving those is nt that easy
- - I ve seen those chocolate bacon bars at stores  but have never actually tried one . Is it something you ve had before of that you want to try 
  - I ve had it before . It s pretty expensive so I do nt get it that much but man is it delicious .
- - Does Drew Brees have a difficult name to spell 
  - That would be my autocorrect . I m working on mobile here .
- - Secret are garbage and Puppey suffers from Dunning-Kruger . Chinese domination incoming boys .
  - And which chinese team do you think of 
- - You mean that group that spends it s time Twitter trolling high school bullies  Yea okay .
  - Are you implying that Anonymous is a group  Because they are not .
- - And there I am  in the back  with my crappy laptop .
  - We think no less of you  brother 
- - Oh crap it is . Well I guess no one can drive now .
  - Does it ban compulsive liars as well 
- - Wow  whoever said those things have been completely destroyed by that comment 
  - I ve been called an SJW for asking people to use the correct pronouns for trans people .
- - Oddone  Doublelift  Balls  Qtpie  Reginald  Scarra  and Lyte . Why the fuck LoP full of strange creatures 
  - They are all North American  might be why they are so full of cringe .
- - Well  if you crush the head  the ass is still untouched . If you know what i mean
  - the nanites would disassemble and rebuild her body at a spawn pointe in less than a minuet ...
  - Less than a minute is all I need .
  - is that counting for the time it takes to get to and from the nearest sundy and get out of the MAX 
- - thibs seems like an angry man in general . what s his deal 
  - Kate Upton does nt return his calls .
- - I thought there was serious difficulty concerning the chronology since the Quran was sorted in order of volume length 
  - Religious scholars can estimate relative time frames for specific verses with reference to the Hadith and other sources .
- - Nobodies buying a leaf because they prefer it over a tesla . But because they cant afford it over a tesla .
  - Where does he claim anything like that 
- - One could make the argument that OSU should be up by double digits
  - Or one could look at the scoreboard ...
- - Just one more little update - several media figures have confirmed our team doctor has checked him out so it s not just Ralph being head strong 
  - So could he have been mildly drunk  Would that have shown up in their tests 
- - Vince and Eric both look distinguished ; Vince is a Cheshire cat while Eric looks concerned . Meanwhile  Paul is pissed that his Coney Island hot dog was served cold .
  - Well  you know what they say . Coney Island hot dogs are a dish best served ... cold .
- - Do you have Happy Scrappy Hero Pup 
  - Sadly no . Nor do we have Cum On Eileen .
- - Lucian is probably not a top tier ADC pick anymore .
  - Not since Graves came back . I m surprised Fury picked Lucian into Pilot s Corki twice as well .
- - You need something to turn this stuff on and off
  - Ok  I ll make that later .
- - Umm dude those pictures are blurry to the point where I cant see what your referring to .
  - yap might wan na pull the cam further away for it to focus . Also Mr . Paint Retarder helps keeps things smooth but it dries up slower .
- - he had room no need to run out of bounds
  - Yeah I think his momentum brought him out
- - Sheltie or collie  Either way  he s cute .
  - Sheltie  but he s really big for one so he is mistaken for a small collie .
- - I have a bit of a cold and am kinda tired  everything else is going great
  - Sorry about the cold  but I m glad that you are otherwise well 
- - Why the fuck would a hacker go on a dangerous infiltration mission 
  - Hollywood ca nt really think of anything else .
- - Which supposes to create a safer environment . But for whom is it safer  And for whom does it destroy quality of life 
  - Safer for the wealthy and power elite . Quality of life for the peasantry is irrelevant in so far as they do nt riot .
- - Engrish  What are all the abbreviations 
  - ILS . Instrument Landing System ATC . Air Traffic Control
- - should nt have it  needs the potting mix to stay moist always . Its extremely resistant of root rot  if not immune .
  - This sounds like a plant I need .
- - With a gun in a bad neighborhood I guess
  - You know imma die with my finger on the trigger
- - I m just concerned I missed it  Mich link you miss a side mission if you do nt play it in time
  - I am pretty sure you ca nt miss a DLC quest  there are just better times to start certain dlc .
- - Wow ... looking up cheat codes for console games ... there s something I have nt done online this millennium .
  - Surprisingly  I actually knew that one off-hand . I did nt have to look it up . It ll be stuck in my mind forever now .
- - You just keep having these same dreams at different times  or are they combined  That seems like a lot ...
  - They re almost always separate  though occasionally two or three of them will combine . I dream pretty frequently .
- - And lost your bet . Ohio state looks great  but I feel Oregon will blow right on by them if they make any mistakes at all .
  - You could still make a ton of money by hedging on Oregon if you made that bet .
- - That s great to know  actually . Liked the books  so that s probably why I avoided the movies more than I care to admit .
  - Do nt avoid the LOTR movies . They are really excellent . I stand by what I said about the Hobbit trilogy  however ...
- - I d probably host an auction for their lives and see who would pay me more to save them .
  - This guy is gon na be rich in the future .
