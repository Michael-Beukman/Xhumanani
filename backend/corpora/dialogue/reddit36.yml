  - Anything for my burnt sienna  useless color .
- - I thought he got traded to the Sixers for cash considerations or something at the last minute

  - Never mind  looks like Wikipedia is out of date .
- - why do people keep coming here giving me a definition of atheism that is not even close to it and then want to argue over their misconception of what atheism is -
  - It s easier than actually arguing the point .
- - I bet those mystery naughty feet on the Marauder s Map in the credits of PoA is Roger and one of his ladies .
  - I would nt be surprised if it were .
- - One of us . One of us .

  - I am looking in to learning how to mod . Ca nt wait
- - Stunner just one of those teams you ca nt really hate
  - You clearly have nt been in a Crimsix stream . Actually hate does nt cover his feelings for the amount he rages during their match ups .
- - Having met quite a few  of those I know  mixed race children often look far better than their individual parents .
  - I find that to be the opposite .
- - I will love TD until the day I die .
  - And now we have DT - full circle 
- - I m fairly certain it s visibility . Blue splats around spikes make the spikes hard to see for many people .
  - For everyone else wondering about this  turn off your texture pack and see how it goes .
- - Whew . Glad I can wish you a happy new year 
  - And I hope you have a good one too . Thanks 
- - True . But it is still a crime drama of sorts .

- - You ve got balls saying that on this sub  kid .
  - Being fair  he said he liked them  not that they re great movies
- - It looks like Durkin and Mattison will be on the same defensive staff ... I am erect .
  - The Durkin  mattison  and harbaugh combination will be one hell of a recruiting staff .
- - I was impressed with the range on the new monarchy  even with the slow rof . How is the range on the crucible one 
  - Pretty goods stability is Low but can be made better . I got mine from an engram and got really lucky on stats .

  - What is easier  writing out an essay by hand  or using a keyboard

  - So  Literally ANYONE could have posted that but since it was her and this sub seems to be just a bit too GG friendly  it s obvious .
- - Clearly says only to use form if you are current registered owner  so I do nt think I qualify for that .
  - Crap  I thought I read something different on the DMV website . I ll look again .
- - Led Zepplin . I do nt know what we re doing in this thread .

- - All best to you . We will see our friends again .
  - I certainly hope we do . That s a nice thought .
- - I dont know who Tony Bennett is  but good for Lady Gaga for giving him a shot .
  - He s one of the up and comers like this Paul McCartney fellow that Kanye is mentoring .

  - Glad I could help  If you need any help down the line  feel free to message me and I ll be happy to talk .
- - No more ... because XMage is laggy as hell .
  - No more ... because I have no idea what everyone else above me is talking about .
- - These statistics were obviously recorded on Briggs

  - no it would nt actually  it would get some then break down and be left alone forever .
- - Afaik  Belgium does nt have as many terrorist attacks as France . Am I wrong  How is the situation there

  - I used to work with that guy in Woodies DIY . I used to say he was the Uncle Phil of the shop .
- - Why have i never thought of that  Awesome
  - Yeah  finding that was a godsend . So many hours spent raging at teammates for not communicating anything when it was really me with the problem .
- - Hopefully it ll be the division . I just hope it does nt end up being another destiny hype cliff .
  - Yeah  Destiny really failed at making the ad-hoc MMO a thing  now its fallen to The Division to see if they can pull it off .
- - Still the most depressing ending to a football game that I ve ever seen .
  - Should have just kicked another onside  they had that working for them

  - Awesome I own an Xbone as well .
- - I mean  we have a hoodoo over not being able to beat you  but not really a rivalry is it .
  - No  maybe its because we are close and our rivals are in lower divisions  so outsiders assume we must be rivals .
- - Yeah  but everyone gets pissy about omniscience ...
