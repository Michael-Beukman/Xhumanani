  - Because NekoPara is nt a game listed under Twitch and they probably thought it was funny to pick the closest thing they could find .
- - This dog is literally doing nothing . What is funny about this 
  - It s obviously the most interesting dog  though 
- - Goddamn that s rough . His voice crack when he changes the tense regarding Stuart was brutal .
  - So rough  Do nt believe i ve ever see Rich so emotional you can tell how much he meant to that man and impacted his life .
- - Why the fuck has this not been deleted 
  - Is it not the pizza ya ordered 
- - I always miss my puppies so much when I go on trips 
  - Seriously  I wish it was nt such a hassle to bring them along .
- - there is one rule that forbids all the people streaming from AGDQ s bandwidth . Cirno tried that last SGDQ .
  - Which makes total sense . If everybody does this  the stream would be endangered .
- - Are you talking about that dank widget 
  - I said tweak in the title  did nt I  ... well  I meant widget  haha
- - Do nt vaporize hash oil  you ll end up with lipid pneumonia . Otherwise  sounds awesome 
  - I think you mean if you vaporize cooking oil with cannabis in it  not refined bho
- - took me a few seconds to realize this was taken with google glass
  - I took it specifically to include the overlay  realized later it showed the road conditions pretty well
- - It s really not even a big thing . He was just around sometimes
  - Our cop was on a first name basis with everyone .
- - Massage bars and glosses and lip liners  oh my  I m so excited 
  - They smell fab . I ca nt wait for people to try these 
- - I have faith in this team  but Spo must not use the Cole - Chalmers lineup . Neither of them will be able to defend Harden .
  - Whiteside is gon na get into foul trouble ... we know how Harden can get to the line with ease
- - Cool thing is  it wo nt be .
  - It will be for the three dead cartoonists next to that sentence ...
- - HOW THE FUCK IS THAT NOT A SHOT
  - Vanek did nt really have a stride on him . I agree with the call .
- - Too many Azir mains in this thread . I ca nt deal 
  - Is there any way we can talk about touching up some Azir stuff  I have a massive list of things that makes Azir still feel super clunky .
- - I got ta hear that  The Good Left Undone kicks ass 
  - Another good song . Weirdly enough I ve been listening to rise against on repeat for the last couple weeks . It s nice to see them on the front page .
- - i do nt think word means what you think it does .
  - I mean ghetto as in looking real cheesy and cheap .
- - Thanks for the book  The content is useful for me and the length is great - I m all about being concise .
  - You re welcome  They ll be more to come  If you have any suggestions for topics free to let me know .
- - The next episode of telltale s game of thrones  damnit .
  - Ah  Me too  And also the imax screenings 
- - is ur dvi cable connected to ur GPU or ur mobo dvi out 
  - I tried each one and they both give black screens . If it changes anything  it is a VGA cable with a DVI adapter .
- - How has there not been a sequel 
  - It was a critical success and a financial disappointment . The sequel has been in limbo for years .
  - I do nt think it was ever officially announced before  just rumors and hearsay .
  - It got cancelled a couple of years ago  ca nt do that without announcing it first .
- - I thought they said they were expanding the map to the north-west once they implement the new engine to handle it .
  - A complex and deadly mountain range would be fantastic
- - That s the dumbest thing I ve read today .
  - That s the dumbest counterargument I ve read today but also the only one I ve read 
- - No Xenoblade Chronicles X. Lol  OK then .
  - Someone clearly did nt read the title .
- - Okay I thought wearing skirts was a thing now . I was about to give up .
  - Bruh  Kanye looks hella dope in his WTT wardrobe .
- - good debate  but jesus christ  this guy CA NT moderate
  - Yeah . He s more host than moderator in subsequent broadcasts .
- - Maybe if he d been a more involved father it would nt have happened in the first place .
  - I know you re a troll account  but dude  come one .
- - Why do we give them money again 
  - Because rich and powerful American Jews tell you to . and then there are rich and powerful Christian fundies who also do the same .
- - this is likely a nightmare for mobile users and i m kinda sorry
  - It s ok . I do nt mind
- - This looks amazing . Ca nt wait to dive in . Thanks for posting  OP 
  - It s a super fun series . I ve been watching it for the past few days . Kind of a surprise to see it here .
- - You take your ferret on walks  Now  that is an even more interesting story .
  - You do nt take your ferret on walks  You re missing out  man .
- - Excellent . Roon is one of my favorites  and I enjoy this card ... Not sure if I have mine in Roon  but I will now 
  - I play my Animar deck against my friends Roon deck and once that chimera hits the field it gets really depressing really quickly lol
- - So with the Templar  you stop him from teleporting and get a chest . With Crota  think we can make him teleport for a chest 
  - He has teleported . Saw on a post earlier . Do nt believe they got a chest .
- - They have depression and are being honest about it . Good for her .
  - She is so not ready for the real world so I guess it s a good thing she went back .
- - Ah  OK . I ll delete it .
  - It s okay  I ve already removed it . Feel free to resubmit with a proper title .
- - Lucky you . Have fun with building it . Make sure to post photos when you re done  and if you remember  message me . D
  - Sure  i ll try to remember you
- - Ca nt be any worse than what a bottle of bud light goes through
  - Hey those bottles are up for anything .
- - You guys are nt helping him feel better by posting your own shinies you caught 
  - No shiny has ever escaped me Am I doin it rite 
- - You do nt have to be lonely at farmersonly.com . I ll show myself out now .
  - I m legitimately curious how much of their userbase overlaps with christianmingle.com
- - This is interesting ... and now I m really curious who it was . Care to share 
  - Yeah  I suspect this is common . I got ta know who too ...
- - Hmm . Why would nt a country in Europe that is receiving immigration also have a national ethos 
  - I do nt know  there just is nt one that s as powerful for immigrants in Europe as the American Dream .
- - that argument is so fallacious i can not think of where to begin .
  - it s not an argument . It s a feeling .
- - Yep . How dare they make a port that is superior to Micro-USB in literally every technical way . Who cares about innovation anyways 
  - Why is it better  Does it charge faster and stuff 
- - That link is way outdated at this point
  - It is current as far as normal raids go . But yes it is about a month behind in terms of special raids and such .
- - I would say this is on the more rare end of misprints . Most I see posted are bad cuts .
  - What do you think its value is 
- - Wait  you re telling me doctors do nt live at hospitals    
  - The next thing you re trying to tell me is that teachers do nt live at schools 
  - Or that firemen do nt live in fires 
  - Or that garbage men do nt live in garbage 
- - He s talking about the January sale .
  - Ah ok . Thought he meant for Danganronpa maybe .
- - Would nt a huge infrastructure overhaul be a good way to stimulate the economy 
  - We could do that  if the USA were a democracy . I do nt know if infrastructure contractors are donating as much money to political campaigns as military contractors .
- - No  we get it . It s just not funny .
  - I did nt say it was funny . I just said it was the only reason I could see for it being there  ie making an obscure joke .
- - Yeah I just heard about it from my sister s cousin s friend s uncle .
  - Oi  I think you re lying  Your sisters cousin  is your cousin as well 
- - In what area will you be staying 
  - I ll actually be in Newnan but do nt mind the drive into the city .
- - I love how Phillip Jeffries is everywhere referred to David Bowie where other actors are with their character names .
  - Because I could nt remember his character name off the top of my head and I was too lazy to look it up .
- - I noticed they re also dropping Littlest Pet Shop  despite just adding new episodes a couple weeks ago . Seems like an odd strategy .
  - I m guessing they must have had some bundled streaming contract that happens to expire on that day . So  we might get both back if enough people show interest .
- - To build on that  do you know how to identify more reactive elements based on their position on the periodic table 
  - well  isnt it for metals down and left is more reactive  for non its less 
- - That bit is the funniest thing on the show to date . I laughed my ass off
  - Agreed . The Nucky Thompson guy has great timing .
- - Any one got an HD blazers feed stream  Ballstreams is lakers only  gross
  - Gross  we need our Mike and Mike .
- - So  it snowed . About a quarter inch . I can still see my grass . Andddd schools are cancelled . Thanks  Virginia .
  - Man I wish it snowed here . I m so jealous 
- - No  I m actually closely following the French language  local sources reporting because they re far more credible and reliable than US sources .
  - Link  I d like to follow these as well .
- - I think Kansas  season would be better represented by Wicker Man since it was comically bad .
  - If only they d played Georgia Tech ...
- - Corbin and Dempsey just need to admit that they love each other .
  - Cut a promo to the Dawson s Creek theme . I can see it in my mind .
- - It was a good idea to post this after you got laid rather than before other wise you probably would nt have
  - Hahaha . She s not uptight like that  who do you think took the picture  Told her I d be posting . I was a bit excited .
- - All jokes aside  he is a great instructor .
  - Yeah ... but I mean ... if a girl can hit the penis she can surely punch or kick some testicles . So I take this video as comedy . P
- - Yeah  he is a fan fav . So then who s your favorite pokemon 
  - Vaporeon . . D Has been since I started my first adventure over a decade ago .
- - Why you got ta do me like that man 
  - Got ta defend my home boy Brad Lidge . I m mostly just jealous of the talent on your team .
- - I ve never tried maybe some kind of online strip poker 
  - Yeah not a bad idea . I was thinking something with cards or dice  or a spinning wheel type thing . Thanks 
- - If you re running backwards how is your forward progress stopped 
  - It s because he tried to stop to throw it and was then dragged backwards .
- - Feels a little condescending . There s a full spectrum of options here besides a full explanation and baby talk .
  - Yup . And you should know your kid well enough to use the most effective method for them .
- - The tshirt market is so saturated . Are you making money 
  - no  the  tee shirt market is too saturated . LOL 
- - Yeah  it s been quite the event .
  - Sounds that way . Thanks for going to all this work 
- - Sry for the wait buddy  your third is barbaracle
  - No problem  Thanks man  sorry for the online confusion 
- - sucks that we lost  but i m still proud of my wildcats . K 
  - I know it sucks but that was an awesome half . Nothing to be ashamed of . S 
  - K state lives by the never say die attitude U 
  - And we re out for blood next year . WILDCATS 
- - So what  She s a popular figure among the feminist media . What are you getting at 
  - That was it . That was the point I was getting at .
- - A broken clock is right twice a day  Florio literally throws shit at the wall and sees what sticks .
  - I do nt think he literally does that . I hope .
- - Dark Side is also the back code used in Epic software that no one is suppose to touch . Just Saying .
  - I deal with epic s dark side daily . I hate it
- - Do nt they come to Youtube a couple days later  for free 
  - Only the podcast or occasionally games he s playing . However there are other people who upload the VOD s .
- - Oh man  thanks for transporting me back to my worst relationship ever ...
  - It could nt have been a girl  right 
- - It s gon na be on a level of popularity equivalent to a picture of JFK taking down Hitler in a boxing ring
  - They got framed stills from that gif going up in American Legion halls as we speak .
- - Seems like it  but that does nt a genius make .
  - And sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken .
- - Awesome giver . Gave me an extra gift so thanks 
  - Happy to help a tapper in need - Happy Tapping
- - I guess  but the Fallen have a pretty satisfying precision kill  too .
  - I like the vex precision kill . Shoot them and they jizz their legs as they get blown in half .
- - I have Atlantis . I have Subtank . Subtank wins .
  - Definitely agree here . Hands down subtank wins .
- - So jealous  I do nt have enough space to add that much to my stash but I sooo wish I that I did
  - Had to buy new bins just to store it in 
- - Out of all of them  Clinton would be the most fun as first lady .
  - First Gentleman . True . He would also be the most influential  too .
- - Well this is just dripping in irony .
  - Well he does have a relevant username .
- - WTT . Milestone Zetterberg Looking for . Winter Classic Ovi
  - How much value are you looking for on the ms zetterberg 
- - I think it was enough of a clusterfuck that the refs just decided to do nothing .
  - Agreed  and even that was the wrong call . Anytime they pick the flag up they need to review the call  especially in the playoffs .
- - Came here to say this . Watch it .
  - Is it a drama show  or is it actually a thorough  scientific look on the case 
- - That sounds pretty creepy . I d consider getting a new number rather than antagonizing this person .
  - Yeah  but it s such a hassle to go through all of that  so I m hoping to just get it over with without changing numbers .
- - This sounds like a Cincinnati home game . What is going on Indianapolis 
  - Weird does nt feel like that at the game ... they were booing
- - That s when you know it s someone solid teaching  I like that .
  - He made such difference to so many of us . There is so much more to what he did than that but him always saying that will stick with me forever .
- - This makes me want to make roller derby SM fanart .
  - Do it  That sounds so rad .
- - For me personally I m glad . I love getting my WWE in on Mondays . Nothing like it
  - you know that s fake  right 
- - WHAT IS THIS  Is this just some random collection of instrumentals they released before the next album 
  - Zach Hill was making a movie in which Death Grips scored . Seems like this may be the score they recorded .
  - People said the same thing about Govt Plates tho . Are both soundtracks 
  - Gp to me kinda plays like it s own story I do nt think that it was for the movie
- - They really do nt . People have crunched the numbers on this - the amount of thinning involved is almost inconsequential .
  - Could I get a source on that 
- - Exactly  you should also do that for the homeless  instead of giving them money try food instead .
  - How are they supposed to buy drugs with the food 
- - Yeah at Dodger Stadium it was a mad house between periods at last year s Stadium Series . You could nt even walk let alone get to a bathroom .
  - Aaand they ran out of beer in MANY beer stands .
- - hm i might have to try that then . Thanks 
  - You wo nt find other players if you have nt got ALL multiplayer dlc installed .
- - Let me leave afterwards and not make me hang around to spoon .
  - Actually aftercare like cuddling and chatting are pretty important for a persons psyche
- - You are not Jewish  I think you re confused .
  - Being Jewish does nt mean being bigoted  racist and primitive . It s not up to you to define who is Jewish and who is nt .
- - i remember he faught himself in punchout once . forget who won .
  - My money is on my man  Mike Tyson 
- - I ve tried a lot of sauces  but I think if you combine ketchup  ranch  and a little chipotle  it d be pretty good as a sauce .
  - That kinda sounds like a poor man s variation of thousand island dressing .
- - According to the source  they were not entertained  but provoked . So ... good 
  - Provoked to rape her . So ... good 
- - heya I have FFIV and FFXIII gift copies for Wolfenstein if you want .
  - Add me on Steam and we can work something out
- - Any thoughts on what the price might do  What are your crystal balls saying 
  - judging by the market reaction to this ... up .
- - I still have nt gotten a skin yet ...
  - Yeah  they ca nt send them all out at once . They re doing it in waves .
- - Wow - Did nt realize Drew was only a Brave for one year . I must remember it because of how well he did that one year .
  - He was a monster . Did everything we needed him to do
- - Probably to keep the peace should there be a dispute over Gibraltar .
  - so  no moros but english in la costa . I dont believe Spain and UK are going to reach a point where a third party needs to keep the peace .
- - Snuck in to see a movie we were nt old enough to see
  - You rebel you  Next thing you know  you ll be ripping tags off mattresses .
- - This breaks the under water submarine parts and nuclear waste side missions . Maybe have em a bit more separated
  - But it would add more with the new coast lines .
- - It s a ban everyone was forced to make anyway .
  - Not if you planned to pick him first .
- - Does this mean that Crunchyroll will not stream the next part of JoJo s 
  - they havent announced it but you can asssume they will .
- - Would you know why it s not working for me 
  - Not sure  tried on multiple characters and no problem . Restart wow perhaps 
- - What exactly is it for  and are you close to a Microcenter 
  - No sadly and editing  gaming  streaming
- - Paid surveys and internet marketing . Sure  it is nt for everyone but scams they are nt .
  - I get vouchers regularly for grocery shops  Excellent
- - I do nt know if the last homeless drunk asshole that shouted to me about Jesus has a set schedule or if he just makes his own hours .
  - Cause Jesus he knows me  and he knows I m right .
- - Yeah  I do nt expect we ll get shots of the D-rex . And truthfully  I hope we do nt .
  - We wo nt . Jurassic Park is a monster movie franchise at its core  and good monster movies tease  but do nt spoil their monsters .
- - Well that s no racism at least .
  - That s true  but it is truly inappropriate and shitty sportsmanship .
- - Has anyone had any dealings with this site  Is it safe to order 
  - They do nt sell anything  it just compares the prices across retailers in germany
- - it s not free  tax payers will foot the bill . People are stupid .
  - Maybe they re stupid because they do nt go to school or believe education is important
- - That makes total sense yeah  great idea  I ll put that on the list  thanks for taking the time to check it out .
  - You guys are MY kind of Heroes .
- - whispers there are more than two genders but no  trans men and women should nt be considered as a third gender . they are men and women . period .
  - Do nt whisper it dude you can yell it .
- - Anchor Dante is mad weird  but so good . Trying to learn him so I can be godlike . D .
  - Yo if you have nt  step up your Million Carats infinite game ... The real BnB .
