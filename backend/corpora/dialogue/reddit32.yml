- - Pah ... really  Note to self  apply to alliance intel division when i get back in .
  - Do nt forget . apply to alliance intel division when i get back in .

  - The problem is TCu blew that game against Baylor the same way Baylor did to you .

- - Any way to purchase the jacket online  The Self Edge website shows only a medium available .
  - yeah i ll put it up online right now . order it and i ll pack it up for you .

- - Readit eats my battery so fast . Icon owner as well .
  - I do nt use readit  but thanks for the heads up .

  - Except that a decent Nasus shits on Renekton . P

  - If you re playing Skyrim on PC  I strongly recommend checking out a mod called SkyUI . The game is nearly unplayable without it  imo .
  - Thanks  I was contemplating restarting a character to do the mage guild and doing the Dragonborn DLC . This makes it sound much more appealing .
- - You said Hatred was being censored . It was nt . Valve just did nt want to sell it .

  - No nothing like that . It was just an assumption of me
