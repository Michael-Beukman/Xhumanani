  - You have more right to exist than anyone who judges you on the color of your skin .

- - Jus  hang loose  blood . She gon na catch ya up on da  rebound on da  med side .
  - Lay em down and smack em yack em .
- - It does nt work if the opposite player knows well enough to smash di it  fwiw .

- - Competition was hurt and he was nt and healthy Gronk is still the best TE in the entire league .

  - Not a problem . I hope your friend enjoys his introduction to pipe smoking .
- - Well  now I m butthurt . Poop Stories  Nothing as good as that .
  - I imagine every time you hear the word butthurt  your anus clenches with the power of a thousand neutron stars .
  - Well  Butthurt is a very common term in the Navy . Now  Cheddar Chex Mix will bring the puckering of my anus in a heart beat .
  - We could harness your anus . I m sure I ve seen a video somewhere ...

  - . D Cool  enjoy your Love Ball Sentret  and thanks a bunch for the HA Staryu

- - Just wait  that drive will get old .
  - What about those new aeroplanes theyve got these days 
- - So I guess it s common for women to poop on themselves while in child birth 
  - Yep  it s also why some doctors order an enema if you are getting an induction .
- - I m horrified by the ramifications of a prolonged vacancy of that scale .
  - Do nt worry  They wired the fucker like a casino for when the mall fails .
- - If anyone is willing to set this up i will sticky the events to make them official .
  - Thats the thing im not organized enough to get this going but its the thought that counts
- - Playing devil s advocate  I can see why they called forward progress .

- - Domi lighting up the ACC  What year is this   
  - I MEAN THAT NEVER REALLY HAPPENED BUT I LL ALLOW IT
- - I ca nt help at all  but if that Celtic knot chess board was done by you then surely linking it is going to reveal your identity .
  - I m afraid I did not  I just saw that a while back and thought it was an awesome idea .
- - I would say if she is not taking my name then she just doesnt really want to marry me .
  - Why should she have to  How does that prove her love 
- - Nope . Year after year SEC fans strut around like peacocks ... fuck it . Kick em in the fucking teeth while they are down .
  - It s pretty funny  the new structure is more inclusive and less subjective and oddly there s no SEC teams in the final .
- - Any chance for one with the white left in 
  - Just take that image and put it on a white background ... It s not difficult . You could do it with Paint .
- - I d do many unspeakable things for that unica ...
  - Id do your mum for it  faggot

  - Hard man Gattuso was so fun to watch 
- - The rear brake does nt car which way its installed . I run my rear brakes backwards on two of my bikes for rack clearance . Works just fine .
  - You are right . My negative reaction to that detail is more that it is indicative of a seller who may have installed other things incorrectly .
- - Paul Simon is a musical genius  but honestly Garfunkel does nt do anything for me .
  - I would nt even call it hate . It is nt mean spirited or anything .
- - I came here to laugh not to feel . Sorry for your loss .
  - Thank you  Sorry for the feels 
- - Sentret would love to as soon as he locates his ear plugs .
  - RAWLing blames the doges . The doges blame RAWLing  very very loudly . RAWLing puts in a set of ear plugs that look suspiciously like Sentret s ear plugs .
- - You should ask your therapist for help with this topic .
  - I plan on it . Good idea .
- - Am I honestly the only one here who does nt care about cosmetics  reskins or gimmicks  I just want more official maps

  - Perfect  share as many screen shots and information that you can . Chances are someone has had the same problem with that ROM before .
- - I wondered  but that game is not an esports title like the others
  - You know  not every game in existence has to be played competetively .
- - Just ordered one . Hopefully I m not going in over my head on this  but I really like the look of it .
  - Even if you never build it  down the road you can flip it to someone who missed out .
