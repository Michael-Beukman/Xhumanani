  - Because nobody really cares anymore . Artillery exchanges are almost a daily occurrence .

  - Damnit . Now all i can picture is Neptune and Sun with those badges .
- - Only if I get to demand early elections again .
  - Is the said elector allowed to participate in those elected elections  too 
- - Some people enjoy those things . There s nothing wrong with it either .
