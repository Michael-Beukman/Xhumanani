  - it is . But is relevance really relevant here 
- - Bring your snacks and lunches with you .
  - What would you reccommend for an easy mid morning snack  Preferably something i can pick up at a store

- - You have no idea how many penises you have kissed .
  - That look at the start  I was hoping to at least see a side boob .
- - Feel like tech should be ranked higher than UGA and Wisconsin . I guess ohio state beating bama really makes up for the fact that they got embarrassed in the championship

- - Wait til he winds up in the mountains wearing a dress .
  - I ve seen that one before  but this one is more reflective of the current evening .

  - the fact that they re both police officers leads me to believe its a little more than just recycled names  and its new to me dawg .
- - Quick question  I might slightly be interested . Is there a specific amount of GC youre looking for or a certain item  Send me a PM .
  - I dont think I understand y question add me to talk .
- - Corn is considered a good crop to farm because of it s use as ethanol .

  - I heard playing a smartass will get you nowhere . Please  think before you comment .
- - you do nt think all of the money he s made is enough  that is  in fact  his payment .
  - No because most of us realize his efforts for LFC ca nt be materialized  we do nt think that low you see .
- - I thought it was because the Trojan horse could fit a lot of seamen .
  - Most horses can . In my experience .
- - I ve had the stream on all day and I legit do nt think I ever saw CLG on . WTF
  - They have nt been on . Next match is them though 
- - I love the chemistry in this group . Great conversation  and no one really talks over the other .
  - This explains them greatly . They all interact well and have great commentary .
- - do u listen to martha and finest hour  you should
  - aye i quite like martha  never heard of finest hour tho i ll give em a listen
- - Not to mention MINIMAL commercial breaks during the game . Intermission is full of em but that s fine by me .
  - That has more to do with the tournament itself seeing how TV timeouts are not controlled by the network that airs the game .
- - FSU better not fall too far behind because there wo nt be any of that late come back shit vs Oregon . This is a different beast .
  - Yeah  Oregon will pile it on if FSU ca nt get it together

  - i might give that a look thanks 
- - Sheer brute force of Sch possibly . I d be awesome if they went back and caught a Ghastly to get a Haunter though .
  - Haunter s weak to psychic and all of the ghost moves in this generation are physical
- - I honestly do nt know why I visit that sub anymore  it s cancerous .
  - Visiting there is like looking at an ugly car accident  you do nt wan na look but ca nt help it .
- - Lil lockjaw never killed anyone  I dont think .
  - haha  the smoke can make it through my teeth  but the munchies part might suck .
- - I thought I read an article saying Lions were pretenders not contenders . Now about that ...
  - I think that was the article that also stated that Luck was almost as good as Andy Dalton .

  - They put on one hell of a show too  I was lucky enough to meet them this summer . Really cool dudes .
- - If you cant find them anywhere I might be willing to do a candy exchange . I live in Aus and Violet Crumbles are everywhere .
  - I d be so happy to trade hoards of delicious treats with you 
- - Cris Carter was a shithead on the Eagles as well ... Took him a while to mature . Maybe his son is the same way .
  - This is a really good point actually . Most people forget about his first few seasons in philly .
- - I think he was on to something with the no lawyers  thing ...
  - It s funny until local police executes you without a trial
- - Do they have an app I can download  I do nt know if maybe I just missed them mentioning it .
  - It s a work out app featuring Jeff hardy . Pretty good actually .
- - He also showed his ability to lay on the pavement for a couple of hours after taking a hit . He ll probably go quick  regardless of his intelligence .
  - It was nt just a hit though . He got elbowed in the face and slammed his head into a fire truck . You would probably be unconscious too .
- - the fact that you could take a human life means you are just a tiny bit of a psychopath on some level  despite whatever justification you have

- - What is the thrust to weight ratio on this thing  It looks like an almost completely vertical climb at the end  which is insane .
  - It s an insane plane . I d love to be onboard when this stunt is performed .
- - So Marrone is the next HC of NYJ
  - What  No  Clearly we re getting Schwartz .
- - I guess my standards for textures should be taken with a grain of salt . D
  - Well  I might add I played it on PC  on consoles it may have looked slightly less out of place .
- - No  if that was the case  Thailand s economy would crumble .
  - I considered using that as an example but it s kinda dark .
- - Hill is going to have his work cut out for him .
  - Not really . He will have a big game if the Bengals are smart enough to ride him the whole game .
- - Really curious about Ex Machina  you ll have to let me know .
  - Will do . May just do a write up on what I saw during SxSW on here if people are interested at all .
- - Seems really biased ... Being put to death  kind of implies like it s a punishment rather than voluntary  and the information about the death penalty is extraneous .
  - He has been judged insane and that means he ca nt give consent .
- - That s a nice animation  but it s not enough for having our girls 
  - Keep hands out of our girls . Unless I can keep my hands on yours  where you are from 
- - Nice seeing The Cool on there . How do you think it compares to Food and Liquor 
  - I probably like The Cool over Food and Liquor but it s been a while since I ve listened to either full albums so
- - Nice build  similar to what I m getting . Looking at all these build pics is taxing  I just ca nt wait to be in heaven
  - Definitely been there . Good luck man 
- - Cool idea reskinning Love Letter  I wonder if anyone else has thought to do this 
  - I am well aware that there are tons of reskins out there for this game  but I did nt see any Marvel ones .
- - I laughed when you said mule . Makeup smugglers would definitely have a good contour .
  - that would be an adorable contour  maybe Mule looks will be the new Deer looks  . P
- - Glad to hear that . Still waitin  on mine . . D
  - Me too  I ordered it yesterday though haha .
- - Haha not sure if good neighbor or bad neighbor 
  - She s old  and insane  but ultimately pretty nice
- - I would nt be surprised if they do try for it  which is not a knock against the team at all  it s a fantastic strategy .
  - In today s NFL  why in the world would nt every team try it a few times a game 
- - This is so hitting the front page in a few hours .
  - I feel like of I acknowledge this it wo nt .
- - I think dark purple or light blue would look good on it .
  - sounds great  but purple would be too bland as the armor is black already
- - I just had my girlfriend jump on my face to see if this actually worked . It did nt . Because I do nt have a girlfriend .
  - So you mean you slapped yourself in the face 
- - I m always curious as to who would leak these and why they would risk their jobs and reputation .
  - He s a silent guardian  a watchful protector . A dark neckbeard .
- - If that s all the care class consists of then I likely wo nt need it then  since we also have a bunch of nieces and nephews .
  - That s what our class was . If you are interested  I d ask if they could give you an outline of what is covered .
- - Why mention they are stylish and attractive 
  - Because there s an unfair stereotype that feminists are ugly .
- - james spader with a dumb hat . the blacklist
  - You shut your mouth about the hat .
- - When s the next Sharks v. Ducks game  It will be a good one .
  - Only one more at the end of next month . God knows why they do nt play in March or April when it matters .
- - Wow . Snitch much  FYI  bars are exempt from that rule .
  - Bars are nt exempt . Only private building are  like your house .
- - I do nt think you can have the effects of Inspired Rage and Song of the Beast simultaneously .
  - You could be right . I was just looking at that .
- - Beautiful  face and all . I m not sure what being drunk was supposed to change .
  - I was worried I looked like a drunk chick lol .
- - Its still great money I m just saying the prices were a little off
  - Yeh  I just took the average sell offers from Zybez .
- - Exum has been fine  might as well start him some games if your not gon na make the playoffs
  - Later in the season though . He is still not ready . Even strictly from a physical stand point he needs the time .
- - I invested in a muse when they first launched their funding campaign . It works amazingly well .
  - Anything interesting to share from yourself or others  I want to see some spreadsheets 
- - I m a Christian . So anything where someone is clearly looking to fight me on my beliefs .
  - I m not a Christain . So anything where someone is clearly trying to shove their beliefs down my throat .
  - Do you have a second to talk about Based God 
  - For Based God  I have a full minute .
