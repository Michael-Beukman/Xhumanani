- - Hmm  a place with a lot of agreement and similar sentiments . Like an echo chamber 
  - Yup  like what we have now . Just different echos .
- - If they linked the same thing on BTselem you would cry Anti Israel bias then as well . Literally every NGO is biased against Israel in your eyes .

  - Hail  the word you are looking for is Hail .

- - That was completely unnecessary . There is a difference between finishing your check and trying to blindside someone who does nt even have the puck .
  - I thought Panik passed it to the right . It s not very clear though .
- - And you re telling me no one ever smelled it or felt wetness when they were walking  Cat piss smells really bad  especially in that quantity .

  - Hey someone BM me before you . If it falls through ill let you know . Do you use BA as well

- - Pretty heavy statement . No chance you lost it 
  - Did she stutter  People steal in Chicago you know .
- - Could it be the extra print statements  They say do it with one  maybe it s picking up the other ones and failing for that .
  - When I delete the text print statement it tells me I ca nt do that .

  - i feel like he s a young Danny McBride

- - Your cat look very similar to my childhood cat . He s so fluffy .
  - Yeah he s a long haired British blue . Very fluffy . Very fat .
- - That all really depends on where your starting point is . Are you from America  what types of history is your cup of tea so to speak .
  - I am in Colorado . I am keeping this question vague because I am open to anything .
- - I think I m getting royally trolled here .
  - Check my history and karma and make that decision for yourself .
- - Then you will have The Joe Rogan Podcast or any other podcast . I prefer the morning radio show to long form interview any day of the week .
  - Any other morning radio show has this though .
- - I read through and in order to get the email needed to file a ticket  you need to provide an email  you re definitely right  I deleted the post
  - Thank you for being the canary . I think you made a good decision .
- - The moment somebody in our group brought in a combo deck . There was also an Athreos deck people were pretty afraid of .
  - What kind of Athreos deck was it  I have only seen one and it did nt play all that well .
- - I probably could have guessed that people without pics are in general cagey as fuck  so yeah  I could have made that shit up .
  - Most people are malicious . They are just so dumb they do nt even know what malicious is .
- - far from cash but ya just another way to pay for what your already gon na get effectively
  - I m gon na effectively get cash with my Amex card .
- - Are you sure you mean Electra complex  Is nt that the Oedipus complex 
  - Lets just call it the Alabama complex and leave it at that .
- - What the fuck  A walking blowjob on a crowded street is gross
  - The only thing I could think was hoping no kids saw them .
- - Would nt effect their collect of net traffic . I suspect the magnetic interference affects their wireless monitoring programs like the transmitting cables .
  - Sounds like a plausible reason  thanks .
- - It might effect the sales of a licensed digital version of the game  however .
  - I can understand doing it for yourself as a learning exercise  but distributing it is where it crosses the line .
- - Yes it is My GF forgot a couple the other night when making jalapeo poppers . I almost died . And I love spicy stuff .
  - I ll give that a miss then 
- - Dat fish face tho Duck  i meant duck .
  - I take pride in my ducking duck faces .
- - I do nt know what video you mean . Link for the lazy pls 
  - Seeing as I ca nt find it that s gon na be hard
- - Actually  your can booby trap your house as much as you like in certain states  but you are required to post signs about them
  - Wow  this ruins the whole believability and integrity of Home Alone for me now .
- - Nick DiPaolo podcast is also consistently great each week
  - I had no idea he had one . Thanks . Going to check it out now .
- - They re legit  just very expensive so not too common .
  - Good to know . I will have to look them up later .
- - I believe that he is nt planning on moving them until his stadium is finished in LA .
  - This would be idiotic  they d be playing in an empty stadium in St. Louis . No way that they do nt move before his stadium is built .
- - does nt the hive majors perk negate the crit perk though 
  - It negates it against Hive majors  works fine with everyone else .
  - Thanks . I might as well fully upgrade mine then  I can rarely even get one headshot on those damn wizards 
  - Yeah Wizards are very frustrating to get headshots on but having the bonus not procing on knights is pretty annoying .
- - Got ta stream it at watch espn  wave of the future man
  - I tried that  it was also the live look in
- - Welcome back to Diners  Drive-ins  and Dives 
  - I was thinking the exact same thing . Too funny
- - I was expecting Woody Harrelson wiping his tears with money . I got something even better .
  - I was expecting the exact same thing .
- - Not much can be stopped until they start restricting accounts to their local sites - vps and custom DNS would get round easily
  - Dont they just have to block referrals from a few known dns servers
- - couch lock  I.e sitting in a couch eating stuff and watching shows 
  - Dont have to be eating . Just the kind of buzz that locks you into the couch cause it feels so good .
- - Why would you change time zones when you already have a clock on your computer 
  - So you can play in full-screen and still be able to see the time .
- - Honestly I do turn mine off for small sites as long as the ads are nt intrusive .
  - Why  And revenue is usually generated per click not per impression . Do you go around clicking on the ads for smaller websites too 
- - Humor . Getting inside someones head enough to control their body and make them gasp uncontrollably is really hard . Great humor requires great intelligence .
  - It s a lot easier if you choke or suffocate them .
- - UCLA SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE PLAY OFFS GUYS 
  - Yes  they should have . If they could have beaten Utah  Stanford  and Oregon .
- - American here . Looks fine to me .
  - Pretty much the expected speed on the highway around here .
- - Im still using my the Undying title  Going to swap it out with the Insane soon tho ...
  - I have not changed my title since I obtained it .
- - Also  the swords lying around are Westerosi swords  not the Braavosi sort that Syrio is used to .
  - But as a FM deployed in Westeros  you d hope he d be trained in Westerosi swordsmanship .
- - Added . Plz confirm there are dittos for others to see
  - There are Dittos  it is true  Thanks Man 
- - What  We could have gained some ground on those teams . No loss ever means nothing .
  - Well means nothing in the standings the Pacific stays stagnant
- - I would think Kentucky would be happy to trade anyone just to shed some salary cap space .
  - That luxury tax hit is gon na be brutal and really put a dent in funding for their next arena .
- - I think he called THIS op fake  while he was talking about other people calling HIS as a fake .
  - I know  that s why I said he should have clarified this .
- - That makes a lot more sense than what I was thinking . Thank you very much
  - Yeah . Once you enter the load screen  there should be a Switch Characters option on the bottom so you can choose to play between whichever character you d like .
- - Yeah I think last summer was our chance . Unless Soton suddenly become shite then I think MS is happy there .
  - Its possible if we could give him a pay rise over Soton  even if they are doing well .
- - This that mother fucker with the license plate rear fender  I like your bicycle
  - The very same . You can call it Fubar if you d like .
- - They seemed to think that he got man of the match for the catch  Did they know about the batting 
  - They re still figuring out how he got to face so many pitches .
- - Really great  I altered it a bit to fit my setting  but I really like this .
  - That s fantastic  I m glad you like it .
- - I can make a comprehensive review if you need one . feel free to PM me
  - Can you do like a preliminary right now based on the pics here 
- - Damn I thought you were gon na say she found your porn . Maybe next time 
  - well now she has his password  so that s tomorrows TIFU
- - I think I m on the opposite side of the fence here .
  - More places where Ryerson students can get jiggy with it . Or torrent movies . Either or .
- - I ate at Friends the Restaurant in Phnom Penh . Delicious restaurant and a really neat program .
  - Great orgs guys . I love that some people actually give back . I ve seen a ton of people take pics like these  than pretty much walk away .
- - Commercial Break Fun Fact . If you took a spaceship to the sun  it would burn .
  - HOW DO YOU KNOW THESE THINGS  WOAH
- - Its almost like people have other weekly interests besides football .
  - Do your thing man . Did nt feel I came off as dictating your week to you
- - Smirk hinted that they may pursue that prospect in the future .
  - He had tweeted about it . I remember but I ca nt find the tweet .
- - Fact of the matter is that guns make it easier to hurt some in quick fear or anger . Look at Jim Jeffries bit on gun laws and muskets .
  - I found his video not very insightful . But definetly representative of those who like Australian gun laws .
- - you will have the exact opposite feeling when you max it out and then apply for another . I can promise you that .
  - Oh no  not gon na let that happen 
- - I think we can all agree that Ubisoft s problems are not in the writing department .
  - Or the art department . By far  their graphic design guys make amazing settings .
- - TIME published this  Is this the real life 
  - They would do anything to go viral on Facebook .
- - Bullets  yes  but Isaac s Heart would still be affected by lasers  explosives  and contact .
  - I believe isaac s heart is immune to lasers .
  - He s not . Source . Fucking Lost run
  - Why would you pick up Isaac s Heart on a Lost run  It seems like it would only make it easier to take damage you were nt expecting
- - oh man that butt scratch right at the end  priceless
  - That was a nut tug  friend .
- - I m just trying to understand how a hunter managed to keep the freaking coin the entire game .
  - Haha  I was surprised I had it too
- - This looks great . I love Smug Brothers . Looking forward to listening to the rest .
  - When I made the list I did nt even realize Don Thrasher was in the Smug Brothers  so yeah  they have definite GBV connections .
- - How much does JIDF pay you to shill 
  - ahhh - look how cute - the anti-jewish nazi is thinking about money again . Like a jew . Typical hypocrite
- - wow one signed with another team  one broke his neck and the last beat his girlfriend ...
  - dude ... I think he just meant Rodgers wearing the gatorade cup goggles ...
- - I do nt get it  She accidentally hit an Aston Martin . It was nt intentional at all  why are you so mad 
  - I always thought this sub was about people whose faces look a way that makes you want to punch them  not about the back story .
- - do nt forget amnesia and bombs are key
  - Eh at least bombs are key has potential to be good  but it is disappointing when you want something else .
- - Product MELTING  As in melted ramen or the cooker 
  - Cooker  I believe . I ve accidentally microwaved a dry Yakisoba bowl  and the results were horrible .
- - Out of curiosity  how does standard of living compare between China and The United States 
  - It s not great right now  but things for the average Chinese citizen are getting better . The average US citizen  Stagnant at best .
- - Re . rhinos do nt help anyone . Just yesterday I saw a rhino helping a little old lady with her shopping .
  - That was probably just a human at Walmart .
- - Only if you ll be my vice ... president .
  - Where can I vote for this ticket 
- - Congrats  Great looking watch  I just ordered one and I ca nt wait for it to get here .
  - Thank you . It bridges a gap between casual and dress that I love .
- - Do nt do it . If they ask  they ask . Sadly  the problem is that you re dating someone who gives poorly home-made crochet stuff as gifts .
  - She does really great work usually . Also  she has store bought items as well .
- - This guy is in serious need of an interior decorator .
  - The duct-taped wall corner was a nice touch 
- - Are you flying HOTAS  If so I am going to get one tomorrow lol .
  - As someone with a HOTAS . It s still not that easy .
- - I sure hope so  the anti-sec circle jerk will increase tenfold otherwise
  - It s mostly that I have no faith in Wisconsin in big games against teams not named Nebraska
- - She s a witch  How do you know  She turned me into a newt .
  - Ah  TrollX  where you can be assured of a healthy mix of Disney and Monty Python .
  - Oh my god  could you imagine what would happen if Disney and Monty Python did team up  Glorious  glorious silly walks set to singing forest animals 
  - Meh  Monty Python was subversive and interesting in a way Disney never really achieved .
- - I have a quick question . In the playoffs will there be an open bracket for teams to make it into the league 
  - No  the MLG arena is nt meant for OB
- - When I was an emt  I used to love passing that place on the way to UK .
  - The bartender was very cool though so that made up for it having a limited selection so it was nt a total bust . Just not list worthy in my opinion .
- - That data could also mean that minorities do more drugs
  - But studies also show that minorities do nt do more drugs .
- - oh man . that s clever . I thought you might have been mocking me at first . it took me three reads .
  - Tee hee . Spell check allowed it  which officially puts me in the clear .
- - Would you be interested in selling wind waker by itself 
  - Not really would like to sell it all as a unit .
- - Do the voices make you do things  It seems like you would have a tough life .
  - The voices have never told me to do things  however I have had a tendency  in the past  to become violent of my own will .
- - They are very helpful . Thanks brother .
  - Glad to help . Good luck on your project 
- - This and the McDonald s post makes me really hate people .
  - What did you hate about the McDonald s post  The replies  Because I get that .
- - Seems to me that you have Stockholm syndrome mate . Is she telling you what to type  Tap a key twice to let us know you re ok .
  - Sorry . Too busy picking out lingerie for her to wear later ...
- - Behaving like a regular person and furthering the species via procreation is apparently a social construct .
  - As is being human  according to the snowflake cult .
- - Upvoting for that last sentence  hugs 
  - Thank you . He s dying now . I am very sad .
- - I have a feeling Jameis wo nt get near the attention Johnny has gotten
  - I hope so for Jameis  sake .
- - You re comparing playing offline and online and do nt see the immediate obvious difference connectivity wise 
  - It does nt lag or any of that . The problem is the overall sluggishness of my skaters as opposed to the opponents .
- - You ve got Civ and you ve never played it 
  - I played it offline so none of my hours got logged .
- - It is but it s an existing law  not directly aimed at Tesla .
  - It IS aimed directly at Elon s beaming mug .
- - Then you end up with dead mice in your walls and a never-ending stench of death .
  - Exactly . Poison is not a good solution . Much rather deal with the body than the smell .
- - Shit  that was tense . Do you see them again after that 
  - Not really . Big campus and not a lot of frat boys choose STEM .
- - I d be disappointed as fuck if we got a first round finish either way . I want a five round fight .
  - I would gladly accept a first round epic KO . Spinning heel kick to the chin of Jones would be amazing . haha
- - OP s post had far more relevancy than you re piece of trash response . What does the Lord s name have to do with anything 
  - You never know  might be a complaint about Mexican pet sitters .
- - Erm  it was Vietnamese who fought for independence and resistance  no 
  - That s the point . I ll edit for clarity .
- - Wow some dick stole your phone . If you know where it is you should just ring the police .
  - Shame he s a liar though  police wo nt have any leads in never never land .
- - raise your hand if you would feel safe leaving this running while you are in another room
  - I d get drunk and try to cook chili on it .
- - Well deserved . I know no one who goes to more herfs
  - Thank you sir if it was nt for that good experience with our first herf I prolly would nt continue with it
- - How would it be wasted on a hunter  They re range too
  - I meant pally  too many threads opened at once lol
- - Typical tumblr hate . No point in getting angry . Just ignore it .
  - Hate or not  I still feel like it raises a fair point  one which I ve seen floating around before
- - And his mother was a naive whore . Zing 
  - Is the zing meant to be the sound of your witty comment bullet ricocheting 
  - Probably not  because that was a misfire ...
  - Better rack the action and try again .
- - Is MMO  so play with friends 
  - No  and you ca nt make me . . p
- - Is nt that actually the best part  Maybe girls like going through the drill .
  - Part of it is definitely that they re actual amateurs and are nt exactly sure what to do  and also that they re nervous .
- - Did you ever fix your pilot light 
  - got it  thanks  But the water temp needs to be turned up  in my opinion .
- - Yeah  that s the reason I asked . So Cavs traded two first for a back-up center to Anderson when he comes back from injury 
  - I guess so . Nobody is taking that contract .
- - Why would you assume that intellect  creativity  or leadership are sex-related traits 
  - I do not assume these things . Why do you assume that I do 
- - You guys should try You re The Worst on FX . It s like a sexier  less vanilla Happy Endings .
  - I fell in love with what shitty people the characters are in You re The Worst . I ca nt wait for season two 
- - Or not worth anything at all . Kappa
  - I think I like this idea even better 
- - No I am not hovering over that .
  - Come back once you ve finished and tell me if I was right .
- - He played an awesome roll on MASH to . It was a one-time guest spot but he did a really good job .
  - Could nt wipe the spots of blood off his hands . Never will forget that look as he sat on the ground unable to do anything .
- - Guy threatens to pull a gun on skateboarding kids after one of them tries to hit him with his board .
  - Which happened after that guy smacked his board down in a violent manner .
- - If gasol does nt work then maybe someone should try building around a harden and Howard combo . That might work
  - seems like that d be good  hopefully a GM picks up on that idea
- - Can I do another mission tonight or must I wait for the next post 
  - you must wait . You can still do stuff like trading and building and equipping if you want
- - Finally seeing someone mention Alex Wiley . He get s ignored so hard on this sub compared to other underground chicago artists
  - Village Party was my favorite album of the year . He truly has his own style that no one else is even touching right now .
- - I m enjoying the thorough explanations from this ref
  - Did nt you know Hochuli is a lawyer 
- - I m not saying that is nt possible  but am saying that is pure speculation .
  - So is speculating that he took the fifth because Adnan had confessed to him .
- - I m very familiar with the call logs and the records and nothing you re saying makes a modicum of sense ...
  - Perhaps if you had a sliver of sense or had even a miniscule brain for logic you d have been able to understand what was said . Sod off .
- - Bro  did you even see the Vault of Glass hunter gear  It looks like he was a robot assembled at a Vex junkyard .
  - ahaha oh man  the chest was so lame . Just a regular chest piece with a random red ring
- - Ukraine will send a team of monitors to protect the fairness of this election .
  - We welcome the Ukrainian team and give them full and complete access to ensure that the referendum is being held properly .
- - For those voting for the first time . Remember to number every box and put LNP last
  - I d personally put the Christian extremist groups last  they re worse than the LNP
- - Do they sell an Authentic jersey in the new style  I have nt seen them anywhere and kind of always wanted one .
  - I m pretty sure Scottrade s store has them . They also had the old ones slightly cheaper .
- - Yeah  just do a lot of casual before you go into competitive .
  - i disagree . i ve played tonnes better in competitive than i ever have in casual
- - i dont think its possible  friend ...
  - Yeah it seems to be a setting when running servers only .
- - Sure . But none of them will be mvp
  - Well considering I could find something workable members of an offense after that but no real stars who there would get MVP .
- - This is awesome  but I wish it went slower or was user controllable  so I could compare them better .
  - I feel the same . I spent a while just staring at the thing so I could see certain shields again .
- - I m not sure I should believe Santa telling me something does nt exist ...
  - No  you re dyslexic . It says Santa .
- - Just a friendly reminder  she is Indonesian not Malaysian .
  - Ah thanks . I just copied the title from the other post .
- - It does nt have to  Intel has binary translator  so Atom can directly run JNI compiled with ARM
  - Oh yeah  I remember hearing about that . Since it s a hardware translator  I m assuming performance cost is minimal 
- - Magic . He s Santa  he s magic  he does what he wants .
  - This . he found me in a trailer . Plus presents . Never question presents .
- - Therefore Hamas and the Palestinians should be punished as well  right  Or is it only a problem when Israel does it 
  - Palestine is a den of horrible terrorists . I hope they both get in major trouble .
- - immigration and asylum are not the same thing  not even close . Youd think someone with a masters international affairs would know this .
  - You re right  In fact  immigration is a broad term that also includes people relocating for a variety of reasons .
- - I was joking but now I ve learned something 
  - Scar tissue rarely regains much or any feeling when it heals . Just to explain why he can shave against the grain and such
- - Gosh  the loading speed ... Why not just put them on imgur 
  - To simulate that they re being served from a Windows Home Server TM of course
- - Put the pitchforks away  Or get more 
  - Idk but I m getting some salad and dinner forks just in case . I do nt wan na be unprepared .
- - Good thing so many people do nt want to be immortal . Less demand means I may actually be able to afford it .
  - I m not sure it works this way . Economies of scale anybody 
- - So correct me if I m wrong but you do nt need to have seen any of the previous Gundam anime to watch Gundam Build Fighters right 
  - It s basically a fanservice show to the gundam audience  and more meta in the sense that the characters are as well
- - You can also use a multimeter if you have one of those .
  - And make sure to measure and subtract the resistance of the leads .
- - We all have to do it  Fuck . What will I tell my wife 
  - You can tell her you ve decided to stop living the lie and leave her for your boyfriend .
- - Nobody thinks Romo is that bad  it just hits a nerve for boys fans so people like to bring it up
  - With rival fans I agree with you but the ESPN watchers and a LOT of Cowboy fans all still think his blunder as a placeholder makes him a non clutch QB .
- - Really  because it looks like Hyperspace from Star Wars to me .
  - Either way is fine to me . Either he hit him so hard he made a black hole or hit him so hard he started moving faster than light .
  - The latter of which is something Superman can do without even IMPing .
  - Well that is a younger Thor without Mjolnir and scans of Superman doing that 
- - yup i agree  I ve got no idea who s going to win I m just hoping it s going to the the great game that it appears to be .
  - Great game with a Packer victory would be great  Good luck  and hopefully a healthy outcome for all the players .
- - So you re saying good cars can pick up guys  We ve been wrong all this time .
  - Nice Audi . You tryna dock later 
- - Word . For my money it was probably the best new TV series that came out last year . That or True Detective .
  - I d give True Detective the edge but The Knick is great .
- - Any BBQ sauce in there  Or did you just use tomato sauce  Love PP pizza 
  - No tomato sauce  just BBQ . It was pretty amazing 
- - Were you expecting more from this case 
  - Maybe  what s it to Ya  I have the right to an attorney during any questioning 
  - Hey you ca nt steal my rifle  I just got done paying for that .
  - Well I m not paying you for it  and I m not giving it back .
- - Anyone know what Argentina s economy is like  Am I fucked 
  - You live in America friend  you re never fucked .
- - Nice  I also use the MPK Mini
  - Having the mpk mini makes me wonder how I was producing with just a laptop . It is such a tremendous help .
- - Sensitive . Muslim countries draw offensive cartoons if Jews daily in there papers . There is no uproar .
  - Not really and I m against that too
- - I think anthropomorphizing a planet hints at the root of most of Earth s problems . humanity s unrelenting narcissism .
  - I could nt have said it better myself .
- - Whoa nobody said anything about a full on rape just a mild diddling
  - Actually I believe we are accusing Joff of a medium style diddling .
- - WHY DID THEY MAKE HIS HANDS BIGGER 
  - you know what they say about guys with big hands
- - Insidious . Had nightmares for weeks after that one  some scary shit .
  - I still need to watch this . Since its raining I might just make it a movie day and watch both the first and second .
- - If it takes you hours to find a gun there s plenty of guides on youtube to help you find a gun .
  - Haha if you think a guide will just instantly find you a gun you clearly have nt played the sa long enough
- - I ve got o check Bendis  DD run  I ve read A Man Without Fear and am currently planning on reading some more DD . Thanks 
  - No problem . If you enjoy that  I d recommend Alias when you re done .
- - I was just reading that last week and that particular passage jumped out at me too .
  - Have you read the entire book  I think it was excellent 
- - the tiger behind her in the third photo is a very nice touch .
  - That was nt intentional at all  but when we looked over them we realised and thought it was great happy accident 
- - Aside from closing the roads  the presence of the President is really a no-no .
  - I have a suspicion they re grooming him for some political career .
- - thats the sea spike you idiot  not the china spike  since this thing doesnt work on china
  - Stop being such a rude cunt  jesus  learn how to communicate .
- - You mean  like lifting it out of the track 
  - Yea because it defeats the latch mechanism iirc
- - For some reason I keep watching this series over and over . I ve never done that before .
  - I do it with Parks and Rec  The Office  and Scrubs . Over and over and over .
- - Let me think about it and get back to you 
  - No problem  I can sweeten the pot  just did nt want to show all my cards haha .
- - Have you programmed your dick and cats paw or does it just accept those 
  - No it s programmed  I probably should have clarified that
- - The United States have a similar  though less extreme problem with their Mexican immigrants .
  - I really kind of doubt it . People generally go to America to become Americans . Muslims seem to go to Europe to make Europe Islamic .
- - This makes no sense . How does it transmit  Do they like bite the other guy 
  - this literally made me laugh out loud 
- - Then I think you take humor way too seriously . Chill out dude . Life is nt that serious .
  - Seriously  this guy needs to get over himself and get off his high horse . Using the word cowgirls is not misogynistic .
- - Nice playing with you . That was much easier than soloing it . Take care .
  - Likewise . I look forward to teaming up with you in the future . Take care dude .
- - Cause you bought it before  you ll buy it again . AWs season pass is nt any different than other games offering similar products honestly .
  - Not saying it is but that s still a bunch of cash
- - You do these things for a reason . You should nt hold anything against yourself . Give yourself a break - you owe it to yourself .
  - To be honest  it does nt matter . For my sake and the sake of everyone around me  it s best I stay single 
- - Honestly though  I would nt blame anyone for jumping ship because of this . Especially since its the way they are starting the club .
  - true but I am too far in . Maybe a casual could leave but I still am attached  as sad as that may be .
- - I believe you are mistaken . From what I understand ; Al Qaeda is in many respects a rival of Isis  similar to what Fatah is to Hamas .
  - So which one of them declared war 
- - They re in default . Not sure what good protesting a going out of business sale is going to do .
  - was thinking this same thing . These employees need to quit and find a job somewhere else .
- - And after the beating  he grabbed his dick and did a pretzel on the mothafucka Fags on here apparently do nt know how they get down in conway
  - Stop making a PKA reference . It s cringeworthy .
- - I think at least half a year .
  - No it s got ta be longer than that .
- - We are a complete joke of a team .
  - You re just now realizing this  
- - I m pretty sure I ve seen this exact scenario with different names in almost every episode they do .
  - Douchebag Danny is an odd mix of Dave and Jarrod .
- - Hmm . That s a clever idea . Did nt even think about doing it like that . Thanks  Will sure consider doing that .
  - As long as you have fun  Happy tokin 
- - If you turn up the thermostat i can guarantee he will come by to turn it down .
  - Whoosh . I do nt get this one .
- - OMG you rager  What did you do  
  - Apparently  I said a lot of bad things to a lot of people .
  - I would nt have believed it had I not seen it myself
  - I need to get my aggression out somewhere .
- - Nice to know that France is a girl .
  - With this being down voted  does anybody know why countries are referred to as females  Honest question .
- - I got a towel warmer for Christmas  and I fully intend to put my undies in it .
  - I think you mean that you got an undie warmer that can also be used for towels .
