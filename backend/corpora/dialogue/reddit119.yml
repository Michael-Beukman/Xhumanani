- - Why does he have to be someone notable 
  - He does nt . But without a book coming anytime soon  we re just grasping at anything we possibly can .
- - I took they as he was telling then that they would die where they stood . Also  they could have gotten information out of Grima far easier than from Saruman .

- - Wow ... Great find if it works . Did you notify Apple of any of this  If so  what did they say  Edit . question added
  - I ve received official response from Apple . They said lol .
- - I seriously love this goalie  man . I want him to get a shot here

  - So  you re saying he could get it published

  - plus it is hardly necessary to say it was a US hunter in the Grand Canyon .
- - If Rivers rejects an offer this offseason and tests FA or waits till next year we should draft a QB this year and pray to lord jesus hes good

- - I would have thought May would be the one least likely to do this  to be honest .

- - it ll tip over easy  no 
  - I think that s what the legs behind the front wheel are for .

  - MLS would be cool but I m dying for an NBA team in St. Louis . Wish we could just have all the sports .
  - i feel like the NBA is sort of a dying league . MLS is on the up and up .

  - But how will we keep prisons open if we stop programming people to come back time and time again 
- - He keeps almost growing up  but inevitably goes back to his same habits . Assault though  this is new 
  - I have nt followed his antics for a long time . Did nt his house burn down 
  - Yep house burnt down . It was bound to happen  they re a bunch of fucking hoarders  and the house was full of bugs .
  - His bedroom seemed crowded enough from his videos  not exactly surprising the rest of his house was like that .
- - Well whether or not somebody made the effort to buy the printer and the higher quality paper might mean something to an employer . It shows thoughtfulness if nothing else .
  - no one actually cares . As technical lead you are often on the hiring side in an interview and I have never seen anyone care about the paper .
- - It would never end until things got nuclear .
  - If that s how they want to play it  I guess they are welcome to try . We have all the nukes .
- - Well  I could die . Less extreme . Someone I know could recognize me on my nude pics  Id deny it but it would be very awkward .
  - I could never publicly post nudes for this exact reason .
- - Hit boxes  What hit boxes  If you were in the damn room it would hit you lol .
  - Did I say hitbox  I meant hit zone .
- - Why did you not jump all over those holiday ones  I cant even find any around me . Im going to have to buy the draggin  wagon online .
  - I ve seen far too many of them . I ve had full sets in my hands throughout the month  but not my cup of tea to be honest .
- - That s funny and enjoy FC but it sits on the shelf while I do everything in DA . I .
  - That s fascinating . Tell me more .
- - Oh . Well  then  let s hope these things are nt bind on pickup .

- - Please spell check before posting . For the love of all that s holy .
  - Believe it or not it s my phone  it autocorrects everything to whatever it feels like . Sorry
- - How the hell had he not bled out already with the amount of blood in this video . I imagine it followed soon after .

- - The funny thing is  membership of the European lobbyist organisation known as the EU  is where these anti-piracy laws originate from .
  - Well yes  that s what she s trying to change .
- - I think it has more to do with preventing players from throwing it into the crowd when they ca nt ice it cleanly .
  - So rule it like an icing . D zone face off and ca nt line change . This is like giving a penalty for icing
- - Sorry  with as large as the universe is ... How can they handle so many operations at the same time and find so much in different regions of space 
  - A lot of outside scientists -- for example  from educational institutions -- work with NASA on their own projects and they are looking for different things as well .

- - Yonkers  New York ... I live in The Netherlands though .
  - Same here mainly because I can pronounce Mary  marry and merry correctly . I m from England .
- - I do enjoy the collective meltdown before every match when I am somehow able to delude myself into thinking I know more than a premier league manager .
  - Theres more to management than picking a team with squad rotation . Many other factors come into picking a squad then form and opponent .
  - I think you missed the point of my self deprecating post .
  - what is the point  i surely missed it .
- - I d go out of my way to avoid being crucified if I knew it was my fate .
  - It was totally a hologram  man .
- - it does say it is still uploading . P
  - Ah dammit  my connection sometimes acts really dumb with dropbox  try again now
- - But we do it to lobsters and crabs .
  - Correct me if I m wrong  but is nt that because they re crustaceans and therefore invertebrates 
- - I use mine for storing q-tips and NYX butter glosses . Perfect height for both .
  - Oh  I like the butter gloss storage idea

  - It s just damage  not base damage

  - So you are telling me you would not get drafted  Or are you telling me you would leave your wife and kids behind

- - The kind of looks the Rockets are getting are the same ones high schoolers would get against middle schoolers . This is brutal to watch .
  - It ll take some effort  but I can fap to this .

  - Do you mean comfort as in being able to walk in them all day  Or comfort as in breathability 
- - What was the summer of Punk recycled from 
  - the previous summer of Punk in ROH

- - That the safe was a bullshit waste of time
  - I FOR ONE SAT ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT FOR MONTHS WAITING FOR THE SAFE TO BE OPENED
- - Why ca nt they match make based on time played 
  - Because that s a pretty meaningless statistic .
- - I dont know why the drone just wouldnt stop recording in order to save battery life so you could fly the drone back . Or was the controller out of battery 
  - Seperate camera and drone so it may just take a dock for the camera etc .
- - Is that not how you re supposed to 
  - Yes it is . But do nt tell Arizonans that .
- - Fucking Christ  that was painful to listen to .
  - Like listening to a creationist explain why evolution is a myth
- - Oh god I hope so . They have been on my wish list for a long time .
  - They re one of the last on my list and have been on it for one of the longest .
- - Some of those hits from Baltimore were downright dirty .

  - I think of it as a type of closed guard and a high guard variant .
- - Well for starters people do nt go to Arby s for a fucking blt .
  - Actually their blt is rather good  but I usually get the chicken club  it tastes great too . Maybe that guy just went to a shitty location .
- - The victim complex from the fans of big teams is amazing . You d think Stoke had assaulted Rooney whilst the ref called him a fat Scouse cunt
  - there are some unbelievably upset ute fans here today
- - I want someone who does this to tell us what they were thinking .
  - You d think they d at least change the title a little bit .
- - I m selling an unusual one with Sunbeams  add me if interested .
  - Oh god I ca nt edit the title What have I done
- - Yep . I have to do this as well .
  - You are both getting an up vote .
- - Anything can set him off . He ll over react to something silly and just get unnecessarily reckless . Enable would be a good fit if you wanted a chill team .
  - Enable would be a good fit also .
- - You ll be fine . I think . Fuck . Will you be fine 
  - I think I made it out alright  Much lower now .
- - Joe Buck fingers his butthole during commercial breaks .

- - You never know what you ve got till it s gone .
  - They paved paradise and put up a parking lot .
- - It s funny  because after you do this  you DO have to do a mission in a harder difficulty to get the Thorn .

  - Indeed it was . I ll get another one some day .
- - And yet I still get calls asking for money every month .
  - What does that have to do with them being responsible with contributions 
- - Was nt giving the others a pass . Just that this is focusing on the catholics .
  - I knew what you meant . I was agreeing .
- - I do nt mean to rain on your parade  but you can simply record a macro that does this and bind it to a key .
  - The plugin is not doing anything new  it is merely doing it automatically . How many times will you forget to press the key you bound to organize your imports 
  - Hm  that s not bad . I guess I ll install this thing then . Thanks  dude 
  - No problem . Do nt hesitate if you have feedback .

- - You ca nt turn a ho into a housewife .
  - I found that out the hard way .
- - It also bothered me that the bad guys plan all revolved around a giant blizzard to occur in NoVa ... complete with snowmobile escape plan

  - Oh you mean like flying a helicopter in a closed building

- - Man that thing is ugly . Hope it shoots better than it looks 
  - it does . and this is an improvement over their previous body design .
- - You sound like a blast  haha .
  - Yes . I do nt like retarded comments clogging up my favorite site when there s a fix for that . Party all the time .
- - Never have I ever had sex with a girl
  - Also considered ... But she left with someone else . So not done .
- - Makes me feel a little warm and fuzzy inside that this young  high potential GM in the waiting that could be very picky about his landing spot choose the Bears .
  - He turned down the Dolphins GM job . So you probably have a bright future ahead of you .
- - Lacazette hopefully  or someone who can grow at the team
  - Scoring machine  hopefully he can transfer that the the PL if he does get picked .
- - Well if you build a story around a flawed idea it likely does nt work .
  - Good thing I ve got the story mostly figured out then . Thanks again

- - Just curious  have you sold that lift yet .
  - I have not yet . Just got back into town
- - Only at the end of watching all episodes do you realize that the episode with the Prime Minister fucking a pig is the most realistic one .
  - Really  I think White Bear could be the closest to reality in the future .
- - Now all you need is a tiny mouse sleeping on top of the cat .
  - With its head pointed up  the same direction as the dog s .
- - What the heck is wrong with being friends with your parents 
  - Nothing wrong with it  but definitely not for everyone . I love my parents but I do nt like them .
- - Tesla model s - for everyone I care about
  - S   more like the D. Now that I m a millionaire  I do nt have time to park my own car .
- - i think you mean doge that s more of the fun thing  is nt it 
  - Yea  litecoin does nt even have that . It s utterly useless and sad .
- - Taker s run with the big gold belt and his rivalries around that time really do nt get the credit they deserve .
  - Does nt help that his reigns were nt very long .

  - I didnt know that . Thats actually very depressing .

  - Yes  I understand . I think things are going a lot slower than anticipated
