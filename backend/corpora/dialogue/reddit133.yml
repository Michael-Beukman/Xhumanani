  - You can personally fix loneliness . You ca nt fix other peoples toxicity .

  - I never said it was bad . It s just his reputation . He is just know to play characters at the top of the tier list .
- - I m on now . Will add you .
  - Added the right FC  added the one in your flair first
- - I do nt think this falls under legal .
  - I think it s definitely a grey area .
- - As a Muslim girl  your burka remark is really off color . You might want to edit that .
  - And it s not even a burka . It is a burqa .
- - Can you show us how you do it  I have been thinking about building a mini fog machine like this for my performance for quite sometime .
  - I should have been more clear in the title . This is nt my video  just something I found on on youtube .

- - my panties got all wet whilst reading this
  - My dick got all big whilst reading your comment .
- - Please delete this . It is going to do more harm than good . For all of those involved .
  - I would like this to remain up .
- - I have seen one of those at a gameday show I went to . It s funny but lacks originality
  - The photo is good though because of the juxtaposition with the marriage proposal sign .
- - HE IS PROBABLY IN THE THREAD RIGHT NOW .
  - I m just gon na assume he s the guy with Khaled Holmes flair . Does nt matter if it actually is him or not  my mind is made up .
- - His Wikipedia articles says he was born in Omsk .
  - Just because you were born in a Country does not mean you need to identify it as your nationality if you ve become naturalized elsewhere .
- - I d prefer that tight kitty . Especially if she likes creampies
  - She does . She wants to squirt one out into my mouth
- - So did he  If he wants to  he should .
  - Yeah I let him watch phantom menace . It s not my personal favorite but I was glad to see that he liked it .

- - That sounds like it could be the early signs of dementia .
  - Dementia  narcissism ... eh  after awhile it all kind of blends together anyway .
- - Or ... you ship her with Anna . Elsanna FTW 
  - But Anna s the only person Elsa knows and loves so it still feels desperate  and stuff . I m guess I m just too picky about what I ship .

- - You can define a constructor . You must define a destructor .
  - But if it s abstract does nt that mean that it is an interface and so none of the functions should be defined and the class is never instantiated 
- - to you  perhaps you read too much in between the lines . it was a simple question which was not for you .
  - Twisting someone position in the guise of a question or is the definition of strawman .
- - We may have freedom of expression but insulting a religion s central figure is in ill taste .
  - Ill taste or not ... killing as the reaction to so called ill taste is by far much worse taste .
- - Lazy to the max . Also  I d rather learn Italian .
  - best answer  though i would rather learn Russian

  - Right  so you hire a lawyer  ... I m saying these guys have their shit together to go through that process  not that they are legal experts .

- - Garden  Free produce for the win .
  - I d love to make a garden but do nt have money for topsoil
- - This is why people do nt take the humanities seriously .
  - at least one person in the comments is sane ... but the Chronicle tweeted about it today . I lost a bit of respect there ...
- - Or maybe only the heart was reversed and everything else is in the right place .
  - And then they flipped the image by mistake . I like the way you think 
  - It certainly seems simpler for only one organ to be reversed than every organ other than it being reversed .
  - Aha  but when you add the flipped scans  that makes two flukes instead of one . Occam wins again

  - Hahaha  I presume along with the hangover you get to enjoy cleaning up as well 
- - Ah . Mostly I make garbage out of pallets . So buying real wood and using hand tools is far in the future . Thanks for the tip

  - I do nt think Dave Chappelle is an INTP . Maybe an INFP or something else .

- - Dont have all of them sorry . I hve more than half though
  - All i need now is kadabra if u can trade me it id appreciate it
- - It s totally their fault  but people need to realize Kickstarter is about investing  not purchasing . Sometimes you do nt get a satisfactory return on your investment .

  - That sounds like the method I used on mine . I wish I copied the walkthrough while it was still up .
- - I like most of these distros  but look nothing like these guys . . C Except Neo  that one s pretty close .
  - The ones I am most familiar with do nt fit me so much either but I do feel represents the community . . P
- - Build a robot suit and wear that . If it functions  you got the job .
  - I like this idea but I do nt think I have time for that . I m no Tony Stark . Perhaps the next interview though .
- - She would never have offered her seat to someone carrying baggage  so she did nt understand why you would .
  - Because I have a concept to let people take my spot . I dunno why .
- - One of your mods has to be interfering with the game or it s just Skyrim being Skyrim .
  - Really  just restart the game and if that does nt work  find out what mod screws with your game .

- - Deedee Lynn  but I m not sure which movie
  - Look up lap dancing her stepfather . Not that I did extensive research to find that out or anything .
- - Her album did explore a lot of sexual themes .
  - Yeah - her album is basically about her being a sex subject rather than a sex object .
- - I think it s fair Favre snagged that unanimous from Brady because Brady snagged it from Manning

  - if you can find the bundle  get that
- - Indonesia  the largest Muslim population in the world . Or India  the third largest Muslim population in the world .

- - I think he s talking about Xbox live .
  - my bad lol . first time i read it through i actually thought he meant nba live
- - Call a massage place and just ask what they can do for you . I have a membership to massage envy and I always have a good experience there .
  - Agreed . Any respectable massage clinic would know how to work with something as common as psoriasis . Just call around and ask .
- - Glad they had that armored personnel carrier . Pig fuckers are a dangerous bunch . Especially if they think you squealed on them .

- - why the fuck is this in funny  how the fuck is this funny
  - It s not  but this entire sub has become a karma-whoring safe haven .
- - These theories come out every year . Sometimes they seem to work and sometimes they do nt . I do nt think there is any way to tell yet .
  - Case in point being last winter . No one saw that clusterfuck coming .

- - Was this painted from a photo reference or from imagination 
  - From imagination  painted this for my sister .

  - Oh Moffat said a while back he asks every year and really wants him back as a regular
- - But wo nt he understand now how much it hurts to be mean 
  - maybe  but not why it s wrong .
