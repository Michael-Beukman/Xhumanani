- - That m file needs to be shared .
  - The what file  Model  Mission 
- - I really want to know the true details of how the Manziel pick went down .
  - I think everybody wants to know that . It sounds from this that haslam is controlling much more than he should
- - Am I the only one who thinks she looks better in the second picture than the last one  Her eyes and face just look more symmetrical .
  - Probably just her facial expression . She may have nerve damage that becomes apparent when she smiles .

  - They re quite feisty so its you do nt stroke them or anything but yeah you touch them a fair bit . They re warm and soft . Very chubby too .
- - That s ... kind of the whole point of that character  is nt it 
  - Yup the whole character and merchandizing scene is directly about this .
- - Im a bit confused is the crescent bay the consumer version or what 
  - It s the latest prototype  and it s supposedly very close to what the consumer version will be like in terms of functionality and tech specs .
- - Hopefully  split up with my significant other . My children do nt need to deal with separate parents
  - Sometimes kids are better off with parents who are nt together .

  - We have the same worries about the Americans .
- - Sorry  go to all comments and look below us .
  - I m still not there with you .
- - You are correct . I found the article on calguns . I feel like more people should know this .
  - Even law enforcement there do nt always know that .
- - Just trying to clear it up  it s the other comments which were unhelpful . I still agree with your post .
  - Cool . Thanks . I get where you were coming from now . You were explaining the unhelpful post s point - not making it yourself .
- - ID is a complete axis fanboy  perhaps even in real life ... take what he says with a grain of salt .
  - Pretty sure Dane is nt a Nazi ... but I wo nt deny that he does generally favor the Axis .
- - Because he gets to the mall BEFORE he gets into the Delorean . He basically pressed rewind on the world .
  - But hes up on the hill looking down there ... how could on body be in two different places 
- - I know it s probably an exaggeration  but if it took you an hour to figure out Skate s controls  it might not be the game for you .
  - Yeah I agree . I did however spend quite a lot of time mastering harder tricks  but you would be doing the same in real life which I love 
- - Screen for women  What does that mean
  - Like a job looking for the best worker
- - NOE is not hunting satellites  hes on a terror mission  typically bombing runs .
  - Even if they have the pulsing red circles around them 
  - Yeah  sat hunters always fly at high altitude .
  - So what do the pulsing circles mean 
- - I joined by default due to the fact the federation did not like my bounty hunting in sol
  - That must be why they attack me on Jupiter ...
- - He died so he did nt really beat it . It was kind of a tie . They both beat each other .
  - Everyone dies ; it s how you live while you re here that matters .
- - They rolled the product into Play and give a redirect on the page for anyone who somehow ends up there . Why would they keep updating it 
  - Because this chunk of it factors into Google search . It s really useful for scholarly purposes  but pretty bad for overall consistency .
- - I m guessing it s to combat stage jitters and tilting 
  - Maybe that s the argument  Is nt that one of the things they sometimes give to snipers 
- - Very interesting . Make sure to post some sound samples
  - Thanks for the support . I ll post some sound samples later this week .

  - Or perhaps Vince is too tightened up . In fact he should loosen up a bit .

- - Maybe I m missing something but most of the hate is geared towards Islam  not Muslims in general .
  - That s not what I read today .
- - I uh ... Think there s a very short list of people who understand the immense meir of your post . It ... Just seems like a massive unrelated rant .
  - You can understand the immense merit if you try .
- - Cool story . Needs more dragons though .
  - I really tried to implement dragons into the story  but I just could nt find the space to do it  I hope I did nt disappoint you too much .
- - this gon na be another player we gon na feel regret letting go . like yaya toure and cesc .

- - Alternatively  they could be asking for loose leaf to be placed into the cup  . p
  - Touch . Still  they could ask for the leaves to be removed . Ha .
- - My boy Solas  Dorian  and Blackwall . Dorian makes fun of Solas all the time and that causes Solas to give these sassy comebacks .
  - This is definitely my favourite combo as well . I sometimes swap out Solas for Cole  because Cole s comments about Dorian s clothes are AMAZING
- - I thought the buffs were given by musicians  different buff depending on the regiment type .
  - Accuracy buffs are given by the officer . Flags give melee  musicians reload speed . Cav officers give running speed buff .

  - Yeah  you should be right if its solo queue  though .
- - I wonder how it compares to other sports game threads

- - Hardly noticed it was down at all . That s some dedicated maintenance work if you ask me . Well Done
  - Are servers up already  Playing on the event at the moment
- - Why do you believe that  So many assumptions .
  - No  just basic math . The money a business spends paying its employees is money that must be recouped from sales .
  - But ... you do nt know the numbers .
  - You do nt have to know the exact numbers . Money spent in one area is money that ca nt be spent in another .
- - I ve seen them drop in the Roc playlist as well as from the weekly heroic

- - pssst - I make Jon Wes Townley look like Ayrton Senna ...
  - Well you would nt be the worst driver then
- - Definitely one of the most catchy Coheed songs  if not the most catchy song .
  - One of the first that I heard  still one of my favourites .
- - I know  but its by far their best lyric .

  - He has some bad games . Denver for instance . Last week vs. SF was nt great either . For the most part he has been pretty damned solid .
- - haha douche bag  go suck an army dick
  - It would be better than sucking your tiny dick
  - Haha I knew you loved that army cock . Assumptions are for losers .
  - It is nt an assumption . It is a definite fact .
  - hahahaha . Douche bag strikes again . They say it takes one to know one .
  - You just admitted your dick is tiny  and yet you keep calling me a douche bag because of your mindless soldier hating . Bravo chap
- - This is awesome . Maybe Jameis can play bad enough to slip to my team in the draft .
  - Meh  look at Matt Ryan s senior year .
- - Ideally  De Boer for me  but that seems unlikely . I ve always liked Tony Pulis as well .
  - Well Pulis is at West Brom now so that s off the table .
- - Those are some pretty restrictive guidelines . Why ca nt I let Mario be king and Luigi be queen  Honestly  that s what I think they d do .

  - the mosque represents other muslims . they are effectively shooting themselves is what the artist intended  from my perspective
