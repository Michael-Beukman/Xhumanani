- - I feel like the west coast in general does nt care nearly as much about new years then the east coast .
  - That s true  It was kinda anticlimactic at new year when everyone finished counting down and nothing happened lol .
- - The only argument against it is that regular Lopunny and Altaria will literally never be used again .
  - Altaria maybe not so much  but is nt it fair to say that outside of Smogon s lower tiers Lopunny was basically unusable in the first place 
- - If your past girlfriends have nt been receptive to the fact that most guys occasionally masturbate  it s likely that they are nt very experienced .

  - Na they re included  all listed under winterboard

  - It is dark times like these that we must stick together until we reach the light . Stay strong brother .

  - I do nt  and to be honest it was the numbers in the original tweets that were the interesting part .
- - There s too much space between the leggings and the skirt while s she standing .
  - Because I drew that based on the frame where she was jumping from frustration . Logically  her skirt will move up but her leggings wo nt .

  - No I have nt and I get to distracted by video games that I just never get to learn about it at home and at school my teachers and the education system
  - Home school is honestly the only option that would keep me from not killing myself but I ve begged and begged to my mom but she wo nt let me

  - He s not here right now . He loves it and I love it more
- - What a stupid rule . This sub is barely even active . There should nt be rules discouraging people from posting
  - The rule is because of a troll who would create lots and lots of accounts . It sucks  but it is a necessary evil .
- - Fuck all religions . Fuck them with a pig .
  - This is pig taking its revenge after being condemned as vilest animals by Islam and Judaism .
- - Mhmm . I know some of those words .
  - Basically . Grossmann really really sucks and the team can not generate any chances . This is just quantified sadness .
- - Well at least you figured it out . p Sorry I could nt be more helpful .
  - No problem . I really appreciate the try 
- - The story of Sodom and Gomorrah itself is probably more significant than that being said a million times .
  - That story always has made me chuckle and just shake my head .

  - too hype about the SWC to remember everything  ; D
- - Just wan na say congrats on your crew ... and nice potato quality .
  - The crew is nothing special really . Thanks .
- - We conservatives are all in agreement about one thing . That Progressives are the most hate-filled  obnoxious  annoying  unhappy  tragic people you will ever come across .
  - Hate filled  I think it s more on the lines of legitimate frustration . Furthermore  your statement resonates hate .
- - To be fair  I can understand the pandas  unwillingness to reproduce .
  - Agreed . Pretty sure pandas have realized of much humans have manipulated the environment and just collectively gave up .
- - How strange . That is messed up  shit just rip the Blu Rays to your hard drive in iso format  you already own the discs .

  - Have nt tried his freekicks yet . Guess I will when i get home .
  - He has a nice build it curve . Just learn how the ball travels .
