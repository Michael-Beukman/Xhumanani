- - Yes  it happends sometimes . It s a bug . Do nt worry  you do nt lose any stars from it .
  - Yeah I figured it was a bug . But I m surprised blizzard has nt done anything about it yet . I guess no good game is without flaws . Thanks
- - Everyone should be allowed to think whatever they like . Acting on those thoughts is a different matter .
