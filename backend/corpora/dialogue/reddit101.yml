  - I want to be in your position again . The anime is amazing .
- - World s most inefficient temporary satellite  Check  Cool looking launch  Check  This is definitely a successful rocket .
  - Glorious Soviet satellite is not of beings temporary  Matryoshka rocket launch satellite into heliocentric orbit 
- - This is nt the case if you buy an AmazonBasics ... those are very high quality cables .
  - The amazon basic cables are perfect . Never had a problem with them and the price is extremely competitive .
- - I m assuming you mean something you do nt have to pay for . Otherwise  I purchased some on Amazon Prime .
  - Correct as a broke college student thats not an option for me
- - My humble apologies for minimizing the horrible loss of your eyeliner .
  - That s OK. One ca nt know the pain unless it s happened to them .
- - The life of a poacher . When you dont get goals you ll struggle to make an impact .
  - Poacher ...  If I remember correctly  Ronaldo has the most assists in La Liga . Not only most goals .
- - Whatever dude . Thanks for being a gent and good sport . Enjoy the rest of the season .
  - No problem . I mean  I m surprised I m actually glad yall ended up beating Bama . You proved us doubters wrong . Good luck against Oregon .
- - I believe you  In a college town  the littlest thing will prevent my success unfortunately though  It s a shame though since I really want it haha
  - wait for some reviews and see what you think 
- - why would anyone on the internet go through all that trouble to prove someone that they can do it 
  - What  like they have anything better to do 
- - I ca nt handle all these horrible local commercials
  - At least the Bears subway commercial is done forever .
- - no  no they are nt . In fact I would go as far to call them useless outside of a few niche escapes .
  - I do nt think you understand just how much this is going to help defending teams .
- - That I would have prefered the other parent to die .
  - I wonder if this is pretty common .
- - Seeing how she is so comfortable showing them off sans bra at work I am sure all her male co-workers are enjoying them .
  - Not so much . She was in a private place  and with her type of work  she has to be very conservative .
- - I ve worked in IT with people that could nt get the difference . It s shocking .
  - I just call it job security . If those people can get jobs  then I will be set for life .
- - I did nt even know that s how the new soles looked . I thought the new version still had the thick black insole
  - These insoles came apart very quickly . I ve heard the construction of these shoes has gone downhill . They still look good .
- - I wonder what his defense is going to be
  - probably withdrawn consent or whatever it s called
  - Withdrawn consent is the opposite of a defense ; it s what makes a previous consensual interaction a sexual assault . Mistaken belief in consent is what he ll likely argue .
  - Yeah  that s what I meant to say . Thanks
- - What the hell  He finds his wife doing stuff with another man and would nt find anything wrong with it  
  - Many people divorce sex from marital intimacy  in the ancient world and now . It s really not anything new . Many prophets had concubines .
- - How is that possible  ... Why would they fire someone objectively making the company money  ...
  - Humans are emotional creatures first . Rationalization is usually tacked on after the fact if at all .
  - How does anything ever get done then  ...
  - Either they get someone else to do the work or it does nt .
- - ok ill load up my game and add you so you can come by whenever you see my gates open .
  - Okay  heading over now  Am I just buying from your Retail 
- - I ll put all of my valuable information on a flash drive disguised as a credit card  cause nobody steals those 
  - And be sure to keep it in your wallet on the dash of your car . Nobody will ever think to look there .
- - You act like Jews are restricting the speech of everyone in the world . What is stopping you and anyone else from mourning them 
  - No  but they do seem to dominate this subject . Perhaps rightly so  perhaps not 
- - Well ... at least it was over really really fast ...
  - Yeah but imagine the fear they felt leading up to it .
  - I d rather not . They died very quickly . Even if they were scared  it s better than something far worse  like starving or drowning them .
  - Yeah you re right . Still terrible thing to do .
- - Did nt see this thread but good to see it got support . Great minds think alike 
  - Yea and maybe the fact that posts such as yours and mine get a lot of support can maybe get them to change their mind hopefully .
- - Yup . Rather get slapped than shot .
  - Or a slap to the face than a slap from a pair of cuffs
  - Or a slap in the face than a slap on the ass from my cell mate .
  - Or a slap in the face than a slap of the wrist restraints in an electric chair
- - An explanation for my reasoning has already been stated to a previous commenter .
  - I know you had some legitimate points  but this is pretty much bait .
- - The first year is so good  but I m really looking forward to seeing Death s son get further into the storyline . He s going to be very cool .
  - Definitely  I m really excited to see what s to come .
- - I still go back and play this game  I adore everything about it  especially the art style  everything looks like an oil painting and it s fantastic
  - Yeah I totally agree the art style is so good  I just hope they stick to it when creating the sequel . Just imagine this on a next gen console 
- - As I mentioned  he amp spontaneously disapeared
  - I would nt say it s spontaneous  she just slowly lost the bulk .
- - When is the next Level Up campaign 
  - up to gumi i wouldnt say anytime soon
- - Got any proof  For verification purposes you see .
  - Just a quick verification and Google search to see other naked photos .
- - Not sure where your from  but bird was the child friendly was of saying penis when I was a little kid . I guess that term isnt universal .
  - I m from the Murica . The southeastern part . That s really cool . I learned something today 
- - I had no idea you can look up planes tail numbers . Does this work on military planes  I have a few tail number i want to look up
  - Do nt think military inventory is searchable by people like us ... but you can always google it .
- - Holy crap great photos . P.S . I kind of freaked out that you do weddings . I m looking for a wedding photographer for July .
  - your portfolio part of your website is nt working  I m not able to see any of your pics 
- - Most ciders get better with age as long as they were properly stored .
  - I find this to be true for about a year . After that they start to get worse . They are made from juice after all .
- - If you want a free alternative of Fraps  try Open Broadcaster Software . That way  you do nt get the Fraps text at the top .
  - Ok thanks  I ll look into it .
- - NYPD have been a shit police department for decades . Only now have the political elite realized it .
  - actually NYC is the safest and best metropolitan city in America
- - Your toilet . You wake up one morning and sit down to take a shit  when out of nowhere something reaches up from underneath you ...
  - And gives you a good ol  early morning fisting .
  - I was thinking of that scene from the Goonies . You know which one ...
  - Yeah  who could forget when Sloth uses Chunk like a hand puppet .
- - They should have just let him run onto the field . It would nt have taken security THAT long to ketchup to him ...
  - He probably would nt mustard up the courage anyway .
- - Yeah  he broke up just before she was taken to a mental hospital  or whatever it s called in English .
  - Mental hospital  psychiatric hospital  or psych ward are the three I could think of it being called .
- - Why does my arm turn red and shake when I eat dirt 
  - Because you re a Native American medicine man .
- - Its offensive  but have there ever been terroristic threats over it 
  - The article says there have been death threats .
- - Meaning she still thinks you re attractive  but a douchebag for what you said . So you still might have a chance  Do what you feel is right .
  - Girl thinks you re a douchebag and has admitted that you re attractive  You re basically already banging .
- - Why do girls where makeup and perfume  Because they re ugly and they smell bad .
  - Who is the ugliest person that you would have sex with 
- - Yeah that shit is fucking weak as fuck god dammit  I used curse words to show my anger at this .
  - lol i feel im trying to listen to rap and in the clean versions they barely say anything in the song because its almost all bad words lol .
- - I agree with you brother . Saying moderate muslim is like saying muslim muslim . We by definition are a religion of moderation . Extremist muslim is an oxymoron .
  - unfortunately too many figure heads are slow to condemn violence . the zeitgeist now gives way to the influence of violent organizations
- - I would if it were HP  Accu  Res ... Not too sure about Def though .
  - When you plan to use Wind living armor its a pretty nice rune
- - What s game photography  Do you mean taking screenshots 
  - Whoops  yeah . Screenshot photography  I guess it s called  Shoulda specified .
- - Golden Freddy has been confirmed to be broken on the Android version . He s not meant to be unavoidable .

- - Are you sure that you are in the right sub 
  - All the predictions are about things happening in HPMOR  so the post may be inane  but it s definitely in the right sub .
- - So how come you can see them sometimes when you sneeze really hard 
  - I have the same question . Hope somebody can answer us .
- - Has Deathmax been taken off the moderator list 
  - He never was a moderator to begin with .
- - You could possibly use a drop in fcg or maybe try some kns pins but standard pins will probably walk all over the place
  - I think I ll look into the pins you mentioned . Thank you
- - I am sorry I am not sure what do you mean . A wat is a temple  I can not convert that into a unit of time .
  - wat as in what . I do nt get what you re trying to say . Please explain .
- - Because unfortunately a bunch of extremists among their ranks have twisted the meaning through their actions
  - Thank you . That seems to be the case with a lot of labels nowadays .
- - Yeah  but what am I doing 
  - You click to start your hero s journey . Choose wisely .
- - Lol he is insane and insanely mean . P

  - I bet you have a lot of friends
- - Thank you for taking your time to clear that up .
  - My pleasure  I want you to be safe . I still think you should practice once but it s up to you .
- - I ve watched every collegiate game he s ever played ... Whenever he played a good defense he struggled mightily  especially against Florida and Louisville .
  - I ve watched every collegiate game he s ever played too . Over half his interceptions this year have been because of his receivers .
- - i think i some how broke it .
  - I think read it again . You replied wayyy too fast to have tried any of that .
- - I suggest Darknet . It s Canadian and on Netflix . Fantastic show  IMO .
  - Very interesting  got me wondering about the original japanese series as well  added to the list 
- - given current obesity trends  I m not sure I agree
  - In the space future the obese are melted down used as a cheap source of engine lubricant .
- - Tahu  but I have nt gotten my hands on Kopaka yet  so maybe him .
  - Yeah  Tahu is a very good set . I will be getting him next month when I have got more money .
- - I m waiting for fallout boy to put out a public apology for that fucking centuries song .
  - Heard it for the first time about a week ago on the radio and I could nt even get through one listen .
- - I ve not heard that one since primary school .
  - That s what I was thinking  Could nt see it on here .
- - That was more a political conflict to be fair .
  - There would be no political conflict without the religious history of the area .
- - Lions did nt seem to have an answer for him .
  - Yeah  you assume Dallas was watching ... wonder how many targets Witten will get  and Murray coming out of the backfield 
- - Search up Crit dual strike shadow . Massive damage  rely on evading everything as a defense . Rogue like enough 
  - Sounds pretty good i will google it thanks .
- - Big fat juicy cock  One ray to another .
  - Yeah  I m pretty happy with what I ve got . p
- - I think it s okay . Not groundbreaking but a fun record to listen to . Glass Hearts is my favourite song off it .
  - Pretty much this . It s not my favorite album ever  but it s nice to listen to sometimes .
- - Custom AOSP roms like cm and AOKP . Roms built from Motorola s software will have these features .
  - Yes  sorry  I should have made this distinction .
- - still do nt think he could keep up with current players .
  - Everyone knows players were nt athletic before YouTube was invented .
- - It was the snow bowl . I m pretty sure it was more or less an afternoon of blundering around building snow forts .
  - Is that legal  like  if there is enough snow on the ground can you just have your secondary work on building a snow wall during plays 
- - I d tell my kids i gave the air stewards permission to throw them out of the plane and into the sea of they did nt behave
  - Do you think children are idiots  They are manipulative little bastards and they are perfectly capable of seeing through empty threats . Source . I m a father .
- - Not sure if I ve missed you  but I m hopping online now 
  - alright  I m online too . Initiate trade whenever you re ready
  - Thank you so much for helping me hatch my shiny Roselia 
  - You re welcome . D thanks for the heart scale and I hope I got the name right
- - Being the best spy in the world .
  - because shooting pounds of cash from a bow is too mainstream 
- - Bill Cullen hosted the original Price is Right  not Bob Barker . Bob would ve been hosting Truth or Consequences around this time .
  - Oh  just let him have his fun .
- - Why is women lifting weights a sport  This is a serious question . I m actually serious  why would anyone want to encourage women to lift weights 
  - You re seriously a complete twat . So you have that going for you .
- - Religious extremism sucks and it does nt matter what religion it is .
  - But some religions have significantly more extremists .
- - You ca nt save anyone . They have to save themselves . That was a long  hard  lesson .
  - You can  however  support someone while they save themselves .
- - Wow  You lot are spoiled are nt you 
  - Arsenal fans forgot being spoilt a long time back  you would nt understand ...
- - I ve already been taking the D for years . It seems like the more I take  the emptier I feel .
  - Probably cause you ve been taking it orally . Try taking it rectally and it should be more fulfilling .
- - Yes  that one looks like it will work .
  - Thanks a lot  you ve really saved me some trial and error .
- - I think I read that the migration patterns actually have nt been made known to people in the area .
  - That s possible . If the wolf hate is strong in that area  conservation officials may have been keeping it quiet in the hopes that poachers would nt notice .
- - Not a bar . Edit . or a club
  - Pretty sure you can meet girls at bars  but yeah clubs would be preferable .
- - Tipping is not a standard outside of the US for the most part
  - They really are nt Canadians ... They re American and it s just an inside term we use for a specific class of people .
- - This meme also works for veterans . Gold  You should nt have  Thank you .
  - Some of us would use these exact words as well .
  - Play battlefield It helps ease it down to where the old survival instinct does nt hit you like a truck
  - tend to play online with my old platoon mates . we end up running battle drills and mopping up fairly well .
- - FULL FILED     FUCK YOU 
  - He drank that dumb six pack before he wrote the dumb title .

  - Thanks  did nt decide on having a go at this months election until last minute .

  - no i edited the information and will mark the thread dead . do nt trust global chat even if they send a whisper about it . P
- - Someone needs to remind Schurrle he s a world cup winner .
  - Yes indeed . He could make same more passes like the one to Gtze in the world cup final .
- - That shit eating grin he had after he got nailed center ice .
  - Loved that . He just loves every aspect of the game . He knew he got rocked and just did nt care . It was awesome . The perfect response .
  - But I guess the fact that Canada was winning handedly helped with that .
  - Lol yeah I m pretty sure that had something to do with it .
- - Moyes would coach this team better than Enrique .
  - Moyes is nt that bad you know .
- - Oh my god  you re like me . When I was young I would watch the informational anytime it came on and my friends thought I was weird as fuck .
  - Finding other people who did this odd thing makes me way happier than it should .

- - Why did Xur want me to buy Voidfang Vestments so bad  if I can never upgrade them  You re sick Xur . You re a sick man .
  - He already sold the upgraded voidfangs ... It s cheaper to buy the new ones than upgrade anyway
  - wtf  when did he sell them  I totally missed that .
  - Like the first week TDB came out . The same week he upgraded ice breaker I believe .
- - How d you get the pivot thing happy 
  - Two bearings made of landing gear and docking ports to hold them in place before launch .
- - it is limit supply now  you ca nt make more of chicken mounts 
  - That s correct  all TCG items are limited since the WoW TCG stopped production when Hearthstone came out .
- - We ought to just have a Civ V skype group or something for organising games .
  - I agree  or at least make the steam group more active or something .
- - Guys ... Can I get a head count of who else is fucked up  I feel like a homeless person .

- - Not a fan of the two new maps . Wish the first two were still in the beta .
  - I ca nt stand the midship remake remake . The other one is alright though
- - Any chance I can try on Phyllis  pants

  - Even then  PT is nt really melee as much as it is close range .
- - Im sorry  but how was he an asshole  if he was blaming himself ...
  - I meant op s story  sorry for the confusion .

  - because it s funny  she s touching him like she s trying to comfort him  he looks miserable  then she s on cam and disowns him .
- - Sry I guess I missed the draft  maybe next time . Thanks for the good info though .
  - I do nt think you did . Also you can always get put on a team mid season  And you should play some SOCL to get your name out there 
- - The goal of advancement is to be better compensated  not to have something to put on your resume .
  - Awesome . You get both when promoted at McDonald s .

  - Because that s what makes you watch the news  so that s what the headline will be .
- - nicotine inhalers have been approved by the FDA for lifetime use as safe .

  - I was about to mention they could just climb down the one Ubisoft has .
- - I knew the John and Jake one  but I ve never seen the Dave one . It is not on the list on the sidebar either .
  - There s actually a lot that are nt in that list . Honestly  I think there are more emotes that are nt in that list than emotes that are .
- - Our brains are physical parts of the universe . Why should nt they experience cause and effect just as other things do 
  - What does cause and effect have to do with the existence of free will 
- - It s like going out in a rainstorm and concluding you do nt really need an umbrella because you did nt get wet .
  - After it already stopped raining on your little spot 
- - I know when you die you lose your loot . But do you lose your skills earned  Is death a total reset 
  - There are no skills in this game . You keep recipes learned unless you re on a hardcore server .
- - Because enemies group up for you to use Ravage on them .
  - They probably do in whatever trench he s in
- - Thanks for the zip ... Doesnt seem to work with my TV . It s an Element  so not a major player .
  - I just looked through the quick remote app and element was listed .
- - When have cats ever really needed us for anything 
  - Now they have self driving cats made from Google .
- - Wow . That sounds a lot uglier than I was expecting . Not sure I want to watch this now .
  - Why is that  I m assuming this pertains to that last part .
- - Femdom is normally a huge turn off for me . For Kurumi  I make an exception .
  - Indeed . I normally do nt like yandere at all  but kurumi was instant favorite .

- - Have you ever shot a GBB  It s very satisfying and does nt sound like a sewing machine .
  - So basically what I said -- just a cooler sound
- - Pointing out you are saying what I am not saying is nt a lie .
  - Those were your quotes  homie . Now  you re just in denial .
- - Got it fixed  Turns out my router security was set to maximum  blocking most of those ports . Thanks for pointing me in the right direction 
  - Np mate  Glad you fixed it 
- - I want to be you when I grow up 
  - Aww  that s so nice . Thanks .
- - I forgot MXE in the list as well
  - MXE is a dissociative  it s much different from lsd and shrooms  more akin to ketamine or dxm .
- - Joe Johnson is the star at this point . Brook and Deron are injured too often .
  - But with Johnson being as old as he is  he s not exactly a franchise cornerstone piece . So can you really claim him as the team s star

  - Indeed . It s amazing how many people I ve met who were just like me but their nationality was Chinese  Russian  Pakistani and so on .
- - Well according to fight metrics Jones did out strike Gus though and that is something I agree with . Jones landed countless elbows and kicks on Gus .
  - This is a great point  but I just wanted to focus on the boxing and not on striking as a whole .
- - What did the leper say to the prostitute ... Keep the tip
  - Two lepers are playing poker  when one throws his hand in  so the other one laughs his head off .
- - I feel like I would end up elbowing myself in both boobs .
  - I feel like that s not possible but I m not a girl so I ca nt confirm .
- - They could ve still gone to sudden death but that one killed himself for no reason
  - I think he confused himself with the one who died .
- - Do you have a measurement of Topre springs rusting 
  - Nope  I can add that to next round .
- - That s some Twilight Zone levels of spookiness right there 
  - I ve already tagged you as Twilight Zone  so the feeling is mutual .
- - You can think what you want . I came here for legal advice based on the information I have . If you have any to offer that would be appreciated .
  - Do you dispute any of that  It s a hell of a lot easier to read than your post .
- - IQ is a flawed metric that is nt well understood  but it does correlate with success and intelligence is  sadly  largely genetic .
  - Any evidence that intelligence is genetic  I do nt have an opinion one way or the other but I d like to .
- - Definitely time to download this to a USB stick and load it into the break room TV at work .
  - Your going to hell . Also probably Centrelink . But mostly hell .
- - Not to soil your national pride  but this dude was nt American . So ... headlines like this make you proud to be an American 
  - Considering he was part of the Allies  as were we ... why not 
- - Most importantly  this program is legal .
  - Legal ... as in blizz has come out and said so 
- - It s such a good game . Perfect example of early access done right .

  - normally I would nt  not sure why I did sometimes I guess it is a bit of habbit or impulse
- - I had no idea the Harris Y was free ...
  - Not what I was saying - I was replying to your suggestion that the OP join the Y  because the suggestion is a good one .

- - That s the Sunday Ticket one is nt it 
  - For me it s gamepass . Same difference AFAIK

  - That might be actually a real review . Do you even know what is joint replacement  There is nothing funny in a person  who is degrading faster than you .
- - Yeah  no one is denying that PC s do nt win out in money overall . I m just saying they re not objectively superior in every way .
  - Considering that consoles are just dumbed down pcs  technically pcs do win in every way .
- - Wait  what  This does nt look like a Who at all
  - A who is not a who  without imagination from you ...

- - I think you re wrong  and I ca nt wait to see which coach s career they kill next
  - Are you actually a leaf fan or do you just REALLY like to be right 
- - Do nt really see the Solar Grenades as a cheese  it really does nt do much for progressing that much faster or easier .
  - Mmm its borderline . It s very powerful because it gives a ton of extra time to the encounter .
- - This would be spook cool . Unfortunately I do nt see requests fulfilled that often .
  - Yeah ... it s a pity they do nt . But a man can dream .

  - But there s no single place to kill DNS . There are hundreds of root servers you d need to take out .
- - What I do nt get is how those climbers get and manage all that gear up there
  - You tie a rope to a bag and pull it up behind you .
- - You will be able to get the game wherever you are . But as there will only be EU and US servers  you will have a high ping .
  - Thats why im afraid of high ping .
- - Yea  I got that but still the meat world  I would like to visit this meat world  Is there a lot of bacon

- - Are there plans anywhere  I d love to free up space this way .
  - Not as yet  but I ll see what I can do this week

  - Just because you ca nt does nt mean it can not be done . It is actually pretty simple to stop the stream . I can do it easily .

- - Be patient . Learn the maps . Pick up better weapons . Stay with team .
  - Everything he said . Try to stay alive  not get crazy amounts of kills .
- - This is the playoffs though . Losing some game is one thing  but losing to the refs in the playoffs is a thing to be pissed about
  - Then it s a good thing that the Lions lost to the Cowboys and not the refs .
- - Calvin s was right in front of an official
  - The head linesman  who reportedly overturned the PI call  should have seen Witten s . It is his job .
- - Please cut down on submissions from your video channel and contribute in other ways that are not purely self-promotion .
  - You ve got it . Sorry about that  I ll remove this .

  - This is from another post long ago . I do wish I had that knife though ... and that cutting board ...
- - If I left it out would it get lots of dust in the parts 
  - Components get a crapton of dust all over them when they re inside a case anyways . I doubt they d get any more dust any other way .
- - I really hope that at some point in the distant future  archeologists find Hobbiton and think that was an actual human village .

- - To be fair  these are hurdles many human drivers have yet to overcome .
  - Yeah you ca nt expect a cat to just suddenly be a human you know 
- - Being an admin is time consuming  and I am shy from a hear problem .
  - Eh  Bean dominion time constipating  and you re shouldering an ear 
- - I do nt know who this guy is and at this point I am too afraid to ask .
  - Gabe Newell  creator of steam  head of Valve .
- - A man  a plan  a canal  Panama  My all time favorite
  - Go hang a salami  I m a lasagna hog . Kay  a red nude  peeped under a yak .
- - Well that sucks . I wanted to have a cobra to replace my Viper for bounty hunting but it looks like that d be a terrible idea now .
  - A Viper is a better bounty hunter while the Cobra is the better pirate due to the extra storage space .
- - With i and Untitled  I honestly see him less as a hip hop legend and more as a legend within music and poetry as a whole .
  - Yeah hell defiantly transcend hip-hop if he makes the right moves .
  - I do nt know why he would be defiant  I d love to transcend hip-hop if given the chance .
  - On that note  I did nt know that hell was a rapper .
- - Exactly . The parents pretty much did the exact opposite of what the trolls suggested . They misinterpreted what they were telling them and made everything worse for everyone .

- - That is awesome  thanks for clarifying . Clearly  I should nt believe everything I hear on YouTube .
  - That s a good life philosophy to have .
- - Did you go to the hospital yet   Are you having your baby  Ahhh tell us more 
  - Mini birth story is in the edit for my OP  but yeah  I got to the hospital juuuuuust in time .
- - Except most people  when questioned by the police  will eventually admit fault .
  - The current state of negativity towards the police would suggest otherwise .
- - And I am most COMFORTABLE working out shirtless  but you do nt see me or any other guys at the gym shirtless  flexing their nipples at swooning women .
  - Did you read a word I said or no  And most men DO work out shirtless  actually . So . Your point is pretty invalid .

  - GG  Corki was nt Challenger I. Corki was Challenger II .

- - I like this response  thank you .
  - I will say I like this more than Gotham . By a long shot .
- - Man sometimes he s really funny but sometimes he s the worst thing I ve ever seen on television .
  - I love his stand up but his show is always hit or miss
- - As a bartender  there s a quite obvious way you can repay him ...
  - True  he is definitely getting his crown royals paid for in the future 
- - Does the protagonist s body type have a big impact on the story  If not  I do nt see how it would matter .
  - Reminds me of the Jack Reacher height freakout .
- - Oh boy - one soulless cat commenting on another one . Clapton Genuine Draft talking about Clapton Lite .
  - Wait  After Midnight  was that Miller or Michelob 
- - I like watching Florida State lose too  but shit  a lot of yall are pretty brutal .
  - You see how happy this mob was yesterday in our game thread watching us lose  It was brutal  they really hate us and Bo Wallace .
  - They did nt hate you guys  they hated the SEC in general is probably why .
  - Oh they hated us specifically  lots of comments about our QB and coach .
