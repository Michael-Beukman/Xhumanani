- - No why  That was a legit question . Dick
  - Do you not know satire when you see it  I was kidding . I got ta say  you are losing your touch .
  - I figured you would answer me instead of make some omegle joke
  - Wow  I ca nt believe you actually think I would do that . I do nt know whether to be disappointed in you  or in myself .
- - Yes  but if you look at the arguments during that time you will see instances of republicans taking public union issues and turning them into ubiquitous issues for all unions .
  - But they never actually used that capital to do that . Some republicans talking about doing it is nt the same thing .

- - And then the packers can come get their asses beat in Seattle again .
  - Yeah  probably . They match up terribly vs the seahawks .

- - That s not bad . Thanks for the info 
  - No problem . I highly recommend this career .
- - Antonio Brown is the best WR in the game .

  - It fits tts  good for layering if youre a medium .
- - Then you have no business in this topic  because we are asking about a unified Earth  not an anarchist dreamland .
  - The question was about a unified Earth  it did nt say the scenario where our planet is united has to include a state .
  - The fuck do you think unified means 
  - Working together  Operating as a single unit is the definition given by the dictionary . Is a state necessary for this  Nope .
- - That is what i meant . I sound like a dumbass now .
  - No  those comments were a bit harsh lol

  - It s an interesting topic  it s a low key topic for idols for the obvious reasons .

- - Anytime you manage to get landorus behind a wall you simply bought a ticket to u-turn city .

  - I m on it because you re contradicting yourself like it s your job lol .
- - passing is of course generally better for clock management .
  - Depends on the game situation . Obviously you want to run to protect a lead .

  - Ah right  sorry  I think I ve seen them in both vanilla and shattered

- - At the very least I wish we could dye racial gear .
  - Getting to play around with colouring the Miqote gear in Lightning Returns has had me wanting this for quite a while
- - All rinsing does is wash away the starch that s produced while cooking . Any change in carbohydrate content due to the rinsing is negligible

  - Belize is full of almost hot trannies as BJ .

  - If it were nt for those dreadful taillights that would be a pretty decent looking car
- - It seems the Khan is on its last legs . Are we about to see a civil war 
  - The Ministry of War is not at liberty to comment . Rest assured  the situation is being dealt with .

- - This is one of the few professions on here that actually seems like it requires a gun .
  - And yet it s not allowed  Not where I m at  at least .
- - I think now that he is nt a player and the media is nt all over him everyone can agree he s a smart and really nice guy .
  - And now he has become the media .
- - You say it ca nt be anything that has to do with loot yet WoW was one of the most played games for multiple years .
  - And I hate WoW . What a surprise . I was asked what I think games with a long shelf life are and I answered .

- - Cries . I may be useful in The Binding of Isaac .
  - So you would basically shoot tears out of your eyes 
  - And bitch about being single . Yup .

- - if you can catch a chicken  you can catch greased lightning .
  - What if you can catch herpes  Cause ... cause I ve done that ...
- - bongo bong is in the smashers and mashers mixtape
  - That s what I thought . Thank you .
- - How do you know that s because he s a homophobe though  Maybe he did nt want his son being filmed 
  - Asked on youtube  Ian Lee says it was discreetly filmed on a phone  so that s pretty unlikely .
- - Aveline was definitely not a stock character . That s all  the rest is fine .
  - I had my one male Hawke flirt with Aveline . She totally shot him down . Bummer .

  - no  the end is when nasa finally finds a way to live on another planet and we can leave these fuckers behind
- - Good luck with that . Hopefully everything turns out okay for you .
  - Thanks man . I hope so too .
- - I do nt think I ve listened to it all the way through since Naked was released .
  - I m assuming that s because you like Naked better  If so  why do you prefer it to the original 
- - That asshole does nt even swallow his cookies  he just crunches them up and throws the crumbs everywhere .
  - Those cookies need someone who cares about them  who loves and appreciates them like they deserve .
- - Yeah I know  but it s only a fan made comic .
  - I do nt think you understand the severity of this sub .
- - Ah  Used to do this and get the same effect with newspaper and nylon stockings 
  - Separately  or some interesting technique of those two combined 
- - They probably tweaked the recording and pitch so do nt expect it to sound exactly like Zac . But it would be nice to try .
  - Maybe  i ll have to be the one to try it  lol .
- - I think they re decent . Any particular reason for your distaste 
  - By Sheogorath  i thought i killed you . How are you still alive Cicero 
- - Holy hell  it was still going  I remember watching that when i first got in youtube ...
  - Yeah different channel tho . Not machinima . It continued on accursed farms .
- - Would you be a Dragon Rider  Cause I m in if so .
  - That would be awesome maybe an quest where you find an egg and the dragon grows that would be pretty awesome
- - Was that jump shot an illegal move in the competition

- - Do you prefer a slap or a bite  Either way your bum deserves some serious attention
  - I prefer a lot a bit of both . . P
- - You re just going out of your way to be offended now . It s sad really .
  - So when is it acceptable to joke about it 
- - Except that comparison only works if he was making a billion dollars a year - which he is nt  it was just a one-time windfall .
  - But did nt he have shares in minecraft  So as long as minecraft grows  he will  right

  - Secret Six is one of best DC series ever .
- - Have you thought about talking to a professional

- - Do nt pilots around the globe still use feet 
  - Yes but why  Do ferries use knots to measure distance 
- - Either way  we can disagree in their actions . They even murdered innocent police officers - not at all affiliated with the magazine but just trying to save lives .
  - Absolutely . Any sane human would . I just think that reacting by creating inflammatory content which offends innocents is not something ti be celebrated .
- - I think in many cases Person A is an ideal partner for Person B  but Person B is not an ideal partner for Person A .
  - That makes no sense . Your ideal partner would be someone who finds you ideal .
