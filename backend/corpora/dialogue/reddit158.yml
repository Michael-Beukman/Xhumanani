  - Do you think if we met  we would mirror one another s movements 
- - You make it sound like RTZ is the main attraction but zai is honestly at least an equally important pick up  not sure how good he is at offlane though .
  - Ye indeed  and they were probably looking for an offlane and zai is the first choice .
- - First time on the interwebs  as far as google knows anyways .
  - It s the same ugly shag carpet from their action figure submissions so I m not doubting ownership  but usually folks know we d like to see the details here .
- - I dont like calling Best a bust . He was a solid runningback  but concussions arent like knee injuries . You cant predict them being a problem the same way .
  - Eh . Given his history  I think it was a high risk .
- - Because the vendor has zero role in managing the customer s scope creep . Right . It is all on the customer lol .
  - You have obviously never worked under contract with the U.S. government . That is exactly the case .

- - So when s TMZ going to break your story 
  - I did nt realize it till I re-read it  I have the TMZ gift .

- - I think they have a pretty fruity smell  Especially after sharpening .
  - Glad to know I m not losing my mind lol
- - Can I hire this guy to pack my car for a road trip 
  - Only if you re cool with him smashing everything you own into pieces while he forces you to pack more boxes and throw them at him .
- - i think this wouldnt have happened if you had been looking at them . the crime is real  people get shot and stuff out there .
  - Well  I certainly would have been able to duck ...
- - If you lash out at someone you care about when you re feeling hurt  there s no guarantee they ll still be with you when you re feeling better .
  - I d hug you if I could .

  - No you do nt want to play the Bengals . You want to play the Ravens . You re just confused right now
- - They should have waves and waves of hives and the farther you get tier wise the better the loot drop
  - I ca nt see them dropping better loot because of RNG  but more crucible marks would be nice .

  - I can confirm that  as somebody who loves boardgames  I played none tonight and still managed to have a good time .
- - My problem is nt as much with public schools themselves but with the terrible teaching standards imposed on schools  ex . common core and no child left behind .
  - Agreed  teachers spend way too much time preparing for a standardized tests .
- - Yes  and Dez should ve been penalized when he went onto the field to argue with the refs .
  - Suh should nt have been allowed to play that game .
- - Illness without health insurance is a huge problem  has been for years . That  and a huge unemployment rate .
  - I live in Florida  which has a shitty employment rate  if you look long and hard enough you will find a job .
