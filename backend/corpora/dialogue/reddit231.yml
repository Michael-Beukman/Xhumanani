  - Thanks  i keep reaching up to adjust a nonexistent ponytail . Still kinda working my way to liking it .

  - Oh  that s when it was established

  - i wish he had some lateral movement too . stop jons timing

- - I was a white boy with a pretty sizable afro  so my good friends used to call me Fluffy .
  - I m in the same boat . I would cut it short but when I do I look like an idiot .
- - I knew it would be good  I love it 
  - Yay  Thanks for being a part of it 
- - Black Tuesday and Southern Tier Creme Brulee .
  - This ones a personal favorite of mine . Nice and smooth  stay away from their plum though .

  - That s a pretty long time  actually  I ve never been on any type of plane  seems so scary to me .
  - Reaaally   It s awesome  But it is scary because it s so strange 
- - What if it was made into a giant fuel tank  with jet engines attached to it to spin it 
  - How are you going to refuel it .
- - They do nt do coupons  as far as I know . Let me guess  Blue and Pinkerton 
  - Totally . I do nt own any Weezer or mofi records on vinyl .
- - The next day  How do you remember things like that  I will have completely forgotten by then .
  - That s my point . I forget most of them but if I have nt it s probably a big enough of a deal .

  - And that you re still in character over this is ... Sad for you .
  - In character  I do nt follow .

  - Because what good is it with you  If a mod needs it  it s a different story

  - Everyone hates you on the enemy team . If they can  they will all counterpick you .
- - I d love a voucher code too please 
  - Thanks  PM with a voucher coming your way .

  - She s super cuddly  It s gon na be a sad day when she s too heavy for me to pick her up .
- - My point was why bother responding if you re just going to be a cock about it and provide nothing to the conversation . That s worse than spoon feeding someone .
  - Probably the same motivation as when you did the same thing
- - Because you look like an idiot calling yourself an expert  then not knowing if a ski is the right size for you .
  - Ok  and you look just brilliant being belligerent for no reason . Enjoy your life under the bridge .
- - Screenshot of plaintext on Twitter . That s all the proof I need . Almost as reliable as an ex boyfriend s rage post about ethics in games journalism .

- - Wait  I thought astro was on satellite Internet .
  - Does it really matter  He s still a horrible lagger
- - It is kinda unfair how the jesus pictures almost always are sexy  when muhammad always is disgusting . We can not even fap to Muhammed 
  - Maybe we could if we knew what he looked like . Unfortunately nobody made any portraits of him .
- - It only lasts for a little while though and it s random each time you eat a plant .
  - Maybe on pc there s a way to do it longer .
- - Sorry i could nt attend  my clock was messed up  and i did nt react in time .
  - Well  that s ok. Hopefully you can attend the next one 
- - I feel like these could be it s own sub .
  - If you build it  they will come .
- - Your shit talk is kindergarten levels of bad .

  - Darren does nt shake his head that much .

  - Good point lol . I guess I just like a social element .
- - Those are nt really high def when I download them on my phone though 
  - Make sure you open them in a new tab . If you save them straight from imgur you wo nt get the full resolution .
- - But now all of that goes to them and nothing to the theaters if I am not mistaken 
  - Google will probably take in some of the money
- - added  . D have breloom  need excadrill  perfect

  - Can do  I ll add you  send me a TR when you re ready .
- - I really dug the relationship between Hal and Sinestro for the Geoff Johns arc .
  - The heart-to-heart Sinestro has with Hal during Godhead was great  too . . D

  - Ya  but that one mistake might have cost him the game .
- - Why are the subtitles in Russian  Where is this from 
  - Really  Of all the questionable stuff in this gif its the Russian subs that jump out the most at you

  - Well  he s allowed to say  he just has to deal with the consequences .
- - Why the hell has nt JJ been in the game yet 
  - He has  though he should be getting more minutes
- - What are your arguments for them not being a discrete thing 
  - They work the same as any other embedded clause .
- - Ca nt go wrong with anyone from the fucking assholes  tier aka Tyron and lushen
  - Just do nt feed the Rakshasa or Verdehile to Tyron .
- - Strangely enough I get a hugely satisfying feeling when I finally kill off that last p link mob .
  - Really  I just feel cheated and like I wasted time .
- - I could nt find enough information  so i decided to post here .
  - If there is nt an announcement article for the second season then we wo nt have any additional information either .
- - There s a lot you do nt understand . And it s all very basic stuff .

- - Cruelest thing is that the parents did nt teach him not to wave a gun around and threaten people ...

  - Sad he did nt listen to her ...
  - We d all be dead under this reasoning .

  - You re cleaver and I like it . PM d 
- - Tarik said on his stream that he honestly would bet on Rhythm  just sharing his opinion .

- - I win  since I use this as my stage name as well .
  - Similar boat here since this is also the name of my main noise project .

  - I think it might end up being somehow poetic . The first half just did nt work out well  but we could get it right in the second half .

- - This is nt really a skill based game  haha . Are there any certain issues you re having 
  - I just know that there are a lot of tips and tricks that someone would not otherwise do  like the running erodes grass thing I learned about recently .
- - Really  Is this being sold from another company or from Boeing direct 
  - Who knows if it s real . I hope it s real but no way to authenticate the instagram acct .

  - Now if only I had any idea what he was singing about .
- - I think the closest to shoulder padded is the Executioner armor or Bandit armor
  - This . Executioner armor is your best bet . Bandit might work  I ll check when I get home .
- - Having had it rated by the Video Game Authority and put it one of those awful cases should significantly decrease the value  not increase it .
  - To some collectors maybe  but not all
- - My partner and I are starting a healing centre quite soon . Any tips 
  - How long u have been doing healing centre for

  - So  there was a stage in his life with a stage in his life 
- - Honestly the lineup we beat tonight may be the worst rolled out by any team this season . Sorry knicks fans .

  - They ve already been posted on here .
- - I wonder how reusable it would be . I would have a hard time disposing of it .
  - I ve had one  not exactly something you d want to reuse . Very flimsy ...
- - I would nt exactly call this touchy  he conceded the game  wished you a good morning and asked politely that you do nt rejoin his games .
  - Passive aggression does not count as actual politeness .
- - This looks a lot like the Duluth harbor .
  - That s the first thing I thought of too . Lift bridge there in all .
- - ITT . everyone quoting It s Always Sunny .
  - Can someone explain the reference  I m too lazy to Google it .
- - Do ye know something we do nt  Why does it seem like ye re all fleeing over here suddenly 
  - Some of us have been here for years .
- - that s ridiculous . the creatine needs to survive your stomach acid .

- - I think it s because everything you say is a link  but our spam filter keeps removing your posts as spam .
  - huh what s happening  am I posting to much 
- - TIL . women who are nt obese look like little girls . I guess that makes me a pedophile .
  - Or a homosexual . Which is a bad thing  apparently .
- - Awesome  I ll need to look that up . I d love to draw my own Fire Emblem family .
  - That s exactly why I started drawing too 
- - Overpass wo nt be going anywhere too . Pros like the map too much and the matches are very interesting on it
  - in my opinion  it still needs to be tweaked to be ready for comp . but it is fun to watch .

- - Those poor NJ taxpayers  having to pay for two plane seats .
  - The point is that Jones paid for all of it . That s what makes it suspect and disturbing in the first place .
- - Why the hell is this tagged NSFW 
  - One of the photos linked in the announcement has boobs .

  - How many hours is it since the FBI came to our house 
- - Just a little constructive criticism for the next video  wait till the sun is up before recording and choose a better spot to film .

  - Yeah . It s not perfect  but it would be a step in the right direction I think  based on what little I know about it anyway .
- - Think of how famous he d be . Not one person in Hollywood would nt know his name .
  - Assuming that the population is in fact greater than one
- - Crusader Kings x Fire Emblem sounds like the neatest of games .
  - Add that to compatibility with what would be the equivalents of Europa Universalis  Victoria and Hearts of Iron and it d be one of the greatest games of all times .
- - Steve Jobs stole his ideas from PARC and Woz ...
  - And PARC stole them from a bunch of other people .
- - I ve been messing around with everything for a while now  and ca nt find the issue .
  - Try putting it on an ohm reader and rubbing and tapping the screws with your finger . Do your ohms jump around  If so tighten your screws more .

  - Nope - it probably consistently accelerating after WOW through to climb and level off .
- - I do nt . I just expect to die .
  - Expect the worst and you ca nt be disappointed .
- - How was this measurement taken  If its a sine sweep  it s not really going to be useful in diagnosing the problem .
  - I think it was a sine sweep . I honestly do nt know ; this is my first time doing this sort of project and my first time using measurement software .

  - Quite possibly  they d probably also not admit their faith was tenuous based on a hypothetical  either .

  - That laugh as Gavin died was borderline psychotic . I loved it .
- - I ca nt wait for the vanu one where it s just a bunch of squashed corpses around the magrider
  - The tr one probably just has the prowler off in the distance trying to snipe aircraft .
- - He loves it ... cause girls love it
  - He could pull girls without the cheesy beiber stuff im sure .
- - I could see him going to nV tbh . Would be dope to see
  - Doubt it . I do nt see how Merk and Boze on the same team would work out
  - Who said they would be on the same team 
  - I really do nt see Merk going anywhere

  - Nah the Redskins win the offseason every year .
- - He revoked citizenship  what did he expect 
  - This is ridiculous . Foreigners are allowed to get in . Specially rich ones . This looks like a retarded form of vendetta .
- - Thank you for posting this  It s the way it is supposed to be .
  - It s supposed to  yet it is extremely unrealistic and naive .
- - Opinions on picking up Sloan and dropping Calderon 
  - Would absolutely do this . Calderon has nt exactly flourished where as the Pacers are on the up and Sloan s initial return has been more promising than anything Calderon offered .
- - i do nt think food poisoning does that . but hopefully it s that
  - I m thinking nausea symptoms . Our radio guy tweeted that Ralph is dealing with food poisoning .

  - Thanks  I was nt aware of that  Although it would nt be too much trouble since I ll need coconut oil for a different recipe anyway .
- - A hairline crack is covered under warranty  if there is no point of impact visible and it is actually a single crack
  - Is there a quote or link or anything where it says this or there is any proof 
- - I think it s time to really start the drinking .
  - LET IT ROLL LET IT ROLL LET IT ROLL
- - Terrible news  rest in peace . Just kind of spells out some of the reasons why that experiment failed in the first place .
  - Eh  he was in Dagestan . Anzhi do nt even play their games in Dagestan despite being from there as there are are safety concerns .
- - What kind of battery  what was it in  and did the coil short 
  - Oh sorry  it was a Kanger EVOD . The coil was shorting  I believe .
- - Here in Canada  train costs more than a plane ticket ...
  - Canada is also huge . A flight from Vancouver to Halifax can cost far more than flights from Toronto to say Germany . Our country is just absolutely massive

  - Also automod . That s kind of a thing here .

  - No  this is the highest BP I ve ever been .
- - Oh well  that s something I did nt know . Thanks
  - It happened . I m not claiming it s smart or coherent 
- - Alright that s far better than any other similar explanation I ve gotten . Alas after hearing that I think that maybe mystery just is nt the genre for me .
  - Yeah  it s not the kind of show that s for everyone
- - Alright  hold one for me for a few days if possible  I really need this
  - Let me know when you re ready .
- - I m looking forward to being in my own my bed .
  - Me too  I miss my bed so very much
- - Nice  why did you nickname her Oven  Did you out a bun in there as some cruel joke  Good little read .

- - Can you please put all three images in one post  Thanks .
  - Ok I think I did what you asked  Is that right 
- - What software do you use to make your job easier 
  - Social Report  simply measured and I am constantly searching for new tools to use .

  - The way he pushes off the post to quickly make crazy saves is just beautiful

  - Red Dead Ressurection . Guess what happens at the beginning .
- - transfermarkt is unreliable  My life has been a lie .
  - i heard transfermarkt is kinda like wikipedia  if you have an account you can edit things . i ve never tried to do it though
- - Do nt let the door hit your bum on the way out .
  - Look at his username  he s a troll
- - Cool . Does he plan to proceed as a barbarian or as a druid 
  - I think he just wanted a few levels in druid for shapeshifting and the majority in barbarian .
- - And this is why strip clubs have dim lighting gentlemen ...
  - Huh  Is something wrong with her 
- - Prediction . solid blue screen close to Wailord s color . Edit . Ha  I m two for two tonight .
  - And you were right  Here s a medal 
- - I think that missing torso is much bigger issue with him .
  - Maybe it s just my experience but Ive never noticed a missing torso using the skin
- - Sounds good  I will do my best to catch up on some research 
  - And we re always here if you have questions . mostly ... I guess ... yeah
- - I was just joking . It is indeed a bug but maybe you can try clearing your cache 
  - It actually worked . Why did nt I think of that in a first place . Thanks .
- - Eve taught me to never buy something you cant afford to lose .
  - and just because you can buy it and sit in it does nt mean you re ready to fly it .
- - That s what s happening to me kinda  I m leaving tomorrow
  - Just keep reminding yourself it ll be worth it and you ll be the highest you ve been in a while after the break
- - It is weird to think under what circumstances this could have been aired .
  - A massive missile launch from the USSR . You d know about it for a few minutes and there s nothing anyone could do about it .
- - Why are you even fighting this  The survey should have had an Arab option .
  - I m not  I hope this was nt coming across as defensive or dismissive . Just explaining the impossibility of an accurate survey about race .
- - As a pilot  I ca nt tell whether I should be disappointed by his tactics or impressed by his dedication to the jet ram .
  - My thoughts exactly . Most people would have bailed out by now .
- - But ... Ui is the younger sister . She just acts older .
  - Ui is really the best example of Ane there is  though .
- - tfw when you cosplay as Vivec  and you do nt have a red eye for the Dunmer half .
  - Someone could poke me in the eye 
- - I want a girl to poop in my mouth
  - Well  I ca nt say that you were nt clear about your desire .
- - Mine has a spotted tongue too  They must have something in common  Edit . Does she have a curly tail 
  - No  it s straight for the most part but can slightly curl up
- - Hate to burst your bubble but smoking everyday does nt really mean you have self control
  - And now my resolve vanishes in a poof of irony .
- - I do nt think he d be a HOF lock right now . If he wins an MVP or another ring  then he d be in consideration for sure .
  - Curious if you consider Kurt Warner a HoF lock 
- - Nuclear weapons . Ya boi ai nt about no mass destruction .
  - They probably did more good than harm in keeping the superpowers from going full blown in another World War .
- - Are you looking to sell on Amazon  Or through your own independent website 
  - see  im not sure about that . i do nt know what my best option would be .
- - I love that this gets posted literally every week . Google please

- - He backstabbed Ned Stark and can never seem to decide where his accent s from .
  - He did tell Ned not to trust him though .

  - Yes  this is true  but people seem to blast you within seconds  do they not read the questions and just think before responding .
- - Nice  I m trying to sell one that is basically exactly like this one .
  - good luck it is a great horn i am okay with it for a long time
- - When he learns sword fighting is a great one .

- - Lol I hope it does the trick  I m pretty interested to see whether it does 
  - So its been more than an hour . I do nt feel stoned lol . Gon na just give up and vape lol .
- - Also  you can change bands if you find a more feminine one . It does seem like there are fewer bands available for the Steel  OP . Be warned .
  - but while the connect piece is expensive  it allows you to use any band with it
- - I saw it thanks . There seemed to be another light following the same path . Any idea what that was 
  - I saw that as well . Thought I was just seeing things . I wonder what it was .

- - I m thinking either Syracuse University or Cornell University .
  - Those are two different schools . Is it a money issue 
- - pretty sure i had this on repeat for an entire month at some point  but i still love hearing it
  - Kygo was like my summer L riding music for all of August and September
- - Athena Pleasures from Big Girls Are Sexy - for curvy girls lovers - highly recommended 
  - Awesome  love her thank you for posting
- - I agree . Gold loss exists for a reason .
  - This . Maybe do nt stop pauses until creeps spawn  but do nt allow a pause until after all heroes are picked
- - Looks like someone is about to be single
  - That s why he gave her a single .
- - some of these look like creatures built by a necromancer .
  - These are the ones the let us see . The us ones are working on autonomy .
- - I think this looks awesome ... Much nicer that the shitty concrete all around it
  - Meh  I think glass buildings like this will look like concrete buildings do now once they go out of fashion .
- - I was always under the impression that you had to be in uniform while travelling  active duty .

  - Ah . Thanks . I ll look into it .

- - You may want to do a virus scan . And reset your browser .

  - no  I mean when cecil is dead not just on vacation
- - i ca nt get his lips to match what he is saying .
  - Probably because it s a heavily edited shitty tumblr gif . Unfortunately it s the only one I could find while using my mobile .
- - Ca nt believe Rask is okay after that vicious nudge
  - ALMOST as bad as the slash against James Neal a month ago .
- - That s almost hard to believe . But maybe only because I spent all day today watching all three extended editions of LOTR . So good
  - I did that while bed bound with shingles a year or so ago . Was such a glorious day .
- - Can you be more specific about what you re looking for then  Saying you d rather eat poo is not helping anyone make suggestions for you .
  - books about people who walk or travel a lot
- - It will go into pokebank  but it will lose the destiny knot . Whether or not gamefreak imposes restrictions in the next game is beyond me .
  - Ok  I understand  Thanks again  man  it has been a real help already 
- - Omar Epps has great seats for the game tonight . On the sideline  Talk about celebrity treatment .
  - Working on House MD for so long had its advantages .
- - I d get high with you and take u to heaven
  - Now thats something I could go for right now 
- - Genuinely curious  is this illegal  Not like SWAT bust down the door illegal  but like purposefully lighting a dollar bill illegal .

  - Latvia man can no have potato  such is life .
- - Loading often is nt worth it because of the time taken charging to that level  even with Focus .

  - That seems to be the way to do it from what everyone s telling me  thank you for your advice .
- - So who exactly is dumping the coins  Should be easy to find out with the public ledger and all .
  - buying and selling on a exchange are not bitcoin spends   trades are not on the ledger
- - I emailed circle a while back they said litecoin was too small and they would consider other coins once they reach bitcoins level .
  - That s horrible tbh and considering that litecoin is nt just some random alt it s disturbing . I hope circle reconsiders it s stance .
- - I think I will start adding almonds  as I have a hard time reaching my fat goal every day .
  - Give toasted sunflower seeds a thought . Higher in fat and usually much cheaper than any true nuts .
- - Your luck must be on another level cause I havnt meet one chick on omegle lol
  - ha very rarely do i come across females  but it happens from time to time .
- - Yes  no food spawns in the sewers  maybe some other type of loot though .
