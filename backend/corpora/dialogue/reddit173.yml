  - Ya  my friend selling me one of their six tickets was thinly veiled as an invite .
- - Youtube has a bunch of videos . I thought I found a playlist of a lot of their dishes  but I could nt find it . I loved those shows 
  - The YouTube channel for great chefs  has full videos of the dishes .
- - They are both humans that went into the void . Not actually void champions .
  - So then Thresh  Karthus  and Hecarim are nt Shadow Isles champions because they were humans that were corrupted by the Shadow Isles  not actually Shadow Isles champions .
- - Ice Breaker  from the VoG exotic chest .

  - I guess they think the guy sharpening hockey skates in the garage is a scary guy
- - I can bring you a few hybrids if you let me get signatures .
  - Absolutely  By signatures  do you mean with my characters  I ve never done this signature thing before . I have two characters in the town .

  - yea i thought that too but there was one time when i died because i did nt get the lifesteal in a manfight with another hero
  - If you died because you did nt get lifesteal on one hit you were losing the manfight anyway .
  - It can happen on a hero like PA with satanic active . Not getting the lifesteal on a crit could be huge .
- - Thanks for asking  that is a disturbing response .
  - No problem  it is . It raises more questions than it answers .
- - A regular day of the life of Murica  with secret deals with the UN  bothering some arab countries  some romantic dates and T.V .

- - Should have known not to click that while at work ...
  - I did nt think it was that bad .
- - Ever consider scanning it and putting it up online  if it s not already  Then crowd source the transcription .
  - Thats not a bad idea  as the family tree is all in icelandic and cursive so I ca nt read enough of it to transcribe .
- - I was trying to figure out what to watch tonight ... I think I just decided . Sherlock is always the answer .

- - FWIW  their site shows In Stock   not red crowns obviously .
  - Update . Oddly enough  I emailed him and he had one with a red crown available .
- - NFL and GOP ... Match made in crony capitalists heaven
  - Despite the fact the NFL is so successful because it has a socialist system between teams where they punish success and reward failure in order to keep the league competitive .
  - The NFL is successful because the franchises fuck over the tax payer for new stadiums and it lends it s a great avenue for gambling
  - It d be successful with or without government subsidized stadiums . But the billions of dollars paid for by the public certainly helps
- - Walcott misses that  but I do nt see people calling for him to be sold .
  - he missed a year  hardly comparable to anyone else out there

- - Some sort of weapon is always a good touch
  - no way  planned on knife handing the whole time ...
- - So I m displaying my ignorance here  but is it only linemen who have to remain absolutely still until the ball is snapped

  - Why bother  I dont think he has told them about all his hookers or blow either .
- - I do nt know what is worse  the nickname or the fact that he wants a Latios for it .

- - cmon replay . hillsborough would be mental .

- - The traffic you hate directly benefits him .
  - Its not about traffic  its about shitty demographics . Not a fan of the people that frequent that area of the city .
- - I highly highly doubt it s worse than the Redskins line .

  - In the time it takes fr him to appear next to his target  leblanc can burst someone
- - What for you are the top things that can make or break a QASA audit 
  - Dirty gaskets have no excuse to be dirty .
- - Is that a bad thing  Is wow losing it s hardness 
  - It is mind numbingly easy to level . But I feel the game is more common sense than skill . Meaning it is pretty easy

  - Rengar before rework . Also the Triple Q .
- - Ambrose just needs a few catchphrases and the sky s the limit .
