- - Yeah  I know its photoshopped . But come on  thats what this sub is for .
  - Oh . Showed it to my cheerleader wife before reading that part
- - And all kinds of other diseases . Too bad we ca nt exchange marijuana s illegality for tobacco s legality
  - That s why you make them both legal and let the people decide .
- - I love it  I use it in place of my fatebringer . I mean the only down side is no elemental damage . Other than that is great 
  - wow  really  your fate bringer  that s crazy man  I heard that the FB is crazy good

- - Is she not  I have nt payed much attention to secret aside from watching some VoDs .
  - Well she was never involved in drama like some other managers I guess 
- - What is the media s obsession with David Moyes based on 
  - Probably because they completely slated him last season  when actually he s a decent manager .
- - You got a great style going there . Keep it up 
  - Glad you like it  I m just experimenting with stuff .
- - That s a good feeling  but even nicer are the days when you can go to sleep without having to even set an alarm and can just wake up whenever .
  - Every day . Trust me  it s not as nice after a while . Still better than having to get up early though .
- - Are there any other users on the computer in question  and if so  has chrome been uninstalled for them too 
  - Nope  it s just him and me  but I only come over here every other weekend .

  - Looks like I know whats moved near the top of my To-watch list
- - I see you cropped out the panhandlers . Really though  I miss Denver so much 
  - Panhandlers is such a nice name for bums  or hobos . It sort of implies they have a skill or a job  like baggage handlers .
- - Miss State fans with the booing of the injured player .
  - I m here  that did nt happen .
  - There was booing on the broadcast right before they showed the replay .
  - Heard none of that . Also the press box is on the GT sideline . Booing what they see as a dirty slide 
- - I m thinking that s a nursing bra she s wearing . If she s nursing that might explain why they are so full .
  - Just looks like two bras to me  which also explains it
- - You re choosing to ignore very vocal opposition to the project .
  - Vocal does nt imply widespread though . What was the support like for this project before it went through 
- - Ca nt flurry  he s a combat master
  - At this point in the game OP is too low of a level to have the flurry finisher .
- - Really cool to see Sneaky on the front page for once  I feel that he is a very underrated ADC .
  - Oh my god this circlejerk still  NO ONE is underrating Sneaky anymore .
- - If you have a big heavy cpu cooler take it out as well as the gpu  the rest should be safe .
  - Mine s pretty light . o Thanks 
- - I love it for the function . I m just much more fond of the no-nonsense UI in Baconit .
  - Same here ... and that speed  With due respect  readit is hell slow in current form due to its plethora of features .

  - Late is fine  See you then .

- - There is essentially zero difference between the winter classic  heritage classic  and the stadium series .
  - Except for hype and media attention ... When was the last time you heard anything about the Heritage Classic ...

  - Nope  you can have DT s without any liver damage .
- - That link is blue and it s staying blue .
  - I clicked it because I did nt honestly expect it to be that . I was sadly mistaken ... I feel violated now .
- - Other than the humidity  traffic  sprawl  and mosquitoes  Houston is a great place .
  - Sprawl sucks sometimes but it is what makes Houston so unique . No zoning  and therefore no place like it .
- - Got ta love em Lions  started strong  rough finish . That was brutal to watch man  hope you found a cozy place

  - Thanks  I m glad you like the vid 
- - You simply do nt have a clue as to what you re arguing . Just stop .
  - Oh  really . Please enlighten me where I m wrong .
- - But how is Swiftspear worse than a Delver 
  - presumably because swiftspear can be bricked by goyfs and delver ca nt be .
- - Eh . I wanted to argue and complain some more  but yeah ... That is pretty much the secret to effective communication ...

  - Thanks  Just used Pages on my Mac .
- - Just the fact that they would have brought back Michael Biehn as Hicks makes me sad that this did nt happen .

- - Anything in Australia can and will kill you .
  - Not everything . Just loads of things .
- - I live in Florida . I can fucking shoot someone if they come at me . So  yeah .
  - You ca nt legally shoot someone because they asked you if you want to see their woody

  - Nothing really yet  as far as I know . Id rather not give him five years if it is us ...
- - I m NOT A FUCKING FRUIT FOR THE LAST FUCKING TIME . so help me .
  - Then this question does nt apply to you
- - Am I the only one who thinks the cats misspell was intentional 
  - If it was  I m not complaining .
- - You re still golden  bro . No worries . It s all good .
  - thanks bro . thats really comforting to read .
- - Was at the match today  very impressed by the enthusiasm of the Southport fans beside being beyond outnumbered
  - I was one of those fans . Gutted . We gave our all in stands and on pitch . I think we deserved the replay .
- - Way to turn something funny into something creepy .
  - Its only creepy if you take it seriously which the majority of this thread seems to have done . Whats wrong with a joke that includes a bit of dirt 
- - I have that same mouse  really good for MOBA games and MMO s  hope you enjoy it 
  - Thanks  I m looking forward to all the macros .

- - Glad you liked it  Let us know how it goes for you .
  - Unfortunately I will receive my package tomorrow it seems . I ll write back .
- - Looks good but logo is waay too big . And what sets you apart 
  - They re quite colourful and I do nt see many sunglasses with these patterns on . I could see how these would be different
- - There s the Stanton penalty . Now call the frikken high sticks  you bats .
  - Would have been nice if they called that cross check too .
- - Oh okay . In the picture they look very blue which could be the filter  I expected raws to be darker .
  - Raws will fade and turn more blue over time  but in this case I think it s just the filter .
- - Oh  I get it  So you re telling me you were hipster before it was cool 
  - Actually  I think hipsters just want to be farmers .
- - Holy shit they just called that . Holy shit . How much money is Jerry Jones wiring to these refs 
  - The league needs to give one of the larger fan bases enough to bring the fans back for the money
- - All these crazy people have these old uranium glasses and cups that glow under a black light and they re Karma whoring it . It s starting to leak onto everything .
  - I must have unsubbed from the right defaults . Now I only observe this stuff indirectly  through this sub . It s a preferable option .
- - I am all for explaining to the customer that a flat white can not be with out foam and that they want a no foam latte
  - This is how my manager told us to handle these orders .
- - Yeah from reading what he is saying  he seems like a normal guy with a huge buddy . Pull it up on your phone  lol .
  - Haha  I should try to look on my phone . Why did nt I think of that 
  - Yeah a lot of people are requesting next to some type of measuring device ... though I saw he ignored all of those .
  - Yeah  makes you think that he might not be that big  but close enough . I do nt think I would sit on it .
  - The pleasures this man is probably missing out on in life .
  - I want to meet a girl that could take that all in without a problem . I do nt think it can be possible .
- - Yeah . I m thankful that we have such well attended lower leagues in England
  - Me too . I d hate to see that change .
- - If you message the mods they ve always been cool about making one if you ask . That s how I got this Walter Bishop flair .
  - Nice flair  Fringe is great . I ll be sure to do that  thanks .
- - When you push the nose down  the tail goes up .
  - Yeah  but the yaw controls are nt inverted too . So only one axis is inverted  get it 
- - No  he s the best player in NBA history and there will never be a player like him .
  - Cant say he s the goat because of era
- - Paulinho central with Chadli and Eriksen on the wings I suppose  Suprised Lennon is nt getting out there 
  - If that s the case  we ve got three attacking mids out of position . Should nt affect too much .
- - GDP has absolutely nothing to do with people s income .
  - It s part of it  but you are right  in this case it s very distorted by the oil based economy .
- - Anybody have a gif of that Vonleh shot  I came in right after he made it . So glad he s finally getting a little playing time .
  - Just an offensive board and a layup right after . Great hustle but not anything special
- - Yes comrade  Let the Slavs be united 
  - Grab your pitchforks and join the Russian madness .
- - No  it s not what they mean when Balmung is an RP server . I have nt even HEARD of any ERP on Balmung . OP s just a dickhead .
  - You re not looking hard enough . Also being a bit of a twat . Clam down ty .

  - You are beyond right . This teaches me to not comment from bed 
- - I listen to something I ve never heard before .
  - What  How do you do it 
- - Love how this sub RAILS against Crota and VoG cheesing but anything else is totally cool ... buncha goddamn hypocrites
  - This sub is nt one person with one opinion on all things .
- - Taurus pretty much sums up my ex s emotions in a picture .
  - As a taurus ... Yeah . Tiny head and lots of bull headed decisions .
- - This is the worst officiated game I have watched all season .
  - What am I missing  I see everyone talking about how bad the refs are but I do nt see it .

  - You have to put salt in the bathtub .
- - He ll probably beat his kids because of those toys .
  - Ha  or ended up in some type of mental facility
- - It s just on hiatus until they catch up  I thought .
  - Only time will tell . We ll have to wait and see I guess .
- - I m just amazed how these blatantly incorrect posts make it to the front page ...
  - It s not that amazing once you come to terms with how stupid most people are .
- - This guy has a serious issue with not coming off like a dick in interviews . Bioware s PR team needs to have a sit-down with him .
  - I think most of his answers are very pragmatic . What parts come off as being dickish to you 
- - Just to let you know ... its everyone else that s spelling it weird 
  - Okay  Glen with one N. Sure .
- - Damn ... the idea of this happening is one of the reasons I really do nt want children . I do nt think I could do it .
  - This is Bob Barker reminding you to help control the human population . Get your Vasectomy or Tubal Ligation today .

  - You can change it Pandora style . You have only a certain amount of skips per hour . You do nt get to choose the next track .
- - Yeah  i plan to make it a tragic manga .
  - Then the death of the mother is the perfectly twisted motive to kill the father .
- - That sounds like an insane rate  is that a regular room 
  - Nah it s a pretty big suite  split a few ways .
- - D . an error  You need to reopen your gates
  - yeah  sorry for the inconvenience from that . thank you and hope you had fun otherwise . D
- - Secretly you hate it  cause it s a terrible song  you re just happy your team scored
  - You know  I legitimately do enjoy the song . I play it on repeat sometimes .
- - It s pretty aesthetically appealing for a pissing in public picture . I like the colors .
  - Idd  it looks like ... a photo session 
- - I would nt trust anyone with my audi for a night tbh
  - Then you too poor to own an Audi .
- - I m real enough to admit this is me
  - That s me in my squad . No shame .
- - This has been discussed here already  like ... alot .
  - Sorry  I m fairly new to the sub and did nt know this . If people want me to I can remove it .
- - Does nt make much sense considering that line-up was having problems until Mascherano dropped back to CB and Bartra and Matthieu went wide .
  - most likely his memory of it isnt that clear imo .
- - Loved on  That phrase just does nt sound right to me .
  - It gets lonely at the yard sale .
- - My HUD would outline all of the girls in the room and give me a percentage based rate of how likely they are to have sex with me .
  - god  that would be depressing . P
- - Newsflash . Even fatties get engaged . Did he get that cheesy heart-shaped diamond at the Dollar Store  Yowza 
  - Hahaha  He just said what we all are thinking .
- - Well personally I think his friend teamed up with the abusive boyfriend killed him . They probably used the hotel key card to kill him there .
  - but why would his friend do that  they probably did kill him in a hotel tho  super crazy story
- - Company might not be around for that haha
  - They re doing fairly well in Japan  I hear . They just might pull out of the US market for now . I m buying a used one  anyway .
- - I am confused by your question . It might have been your intention to confuse me  though . In that case  good job .
  - That was not my intention  so I guess I did not do a very well job after all .
- - From bonfire  past Phalanx  turn left to the ladder . The right is the annex .

- - Find a middleman  Ollo has a guy that does it .
  - Yeah  but nobody wants to be the first to trust .
- - I am trying to think of ways to replace the photobooth but ca nt think of something to replace it with . Any ideas  
  - Why do you think it needs replacing  What purpose did you want it to serve that you feel like you would need to fill without it 
- - Some literally told me It s too easy to get KOed ...
  - You sure they did nt figuratively tell you that 
- - I m from England and live in Texas . A sarcastic compliment usually does the trick in both places .
  - Wow that must have been quite a transition . What city 
  - And while you re already on it  what s your street address and work hours 
  - Also  if you could just write down your license plate  full name and SSN we d save a whole lot of time here
- - No one in this comment chain realized it was a sloppy  incoherent mess .
  - Fortunately the OP will be along to explain this newly minted bowel movement as bold . And extreme  stylistic .
- - How fun  I ve always wanted to do a renaissance fair . There s a really big one near us too .
  - Where are you  I love dressing up in my garb and going .
- - I had a similar situation  but he kept on bringing up how it s illegal and this and that .
  - Ya I feel you . That s why she said if somehow . I get caught she would play it off as she does nt know .
- - If there was no conviction  the statue does not apply . That does not mean the issue can not be used against you .
  - Thanks for your reply  So what are my chances on a motion to quash the subpoena so that they do nt get the police report 
- - Really enjoyed that . Bring on the next song 
  - Thanks  man . Let the Nirvana cover rivalry commence 
- - Ai nt no rule that you can install Linux over the Windows model  right 
  - Maybe not a rule  but there is a possibility of secure boot . Also you would be paying a Microsoft tax .
- - Do nt worry  Chip Kelly s pro offense would never translate to college .
  - Chip to Arkansas  Eagles and Aggies trade coaches 
- - As a Canadian  that s a distress .
  - It s okay  I was already sitting upside down on my couch  eh .
- - I ve added his flair for him .
  - I do nt read comments anymore I just scroll down for everyone s flair  some of them are brilliant
- - It s still morally wrong . Just because there are no consequences does nt make it not wrong .
  - I do nt think a victimless crime is  but I respect that opinion .
- - It was a bit painful watching you not target them as they passed by  but good job nonetheless .
  - Ha ha  I was too busy crapping myself 
- - The faces really make it . Also  Asami really likes to see people squirm lol .
  - Especially Korra ... When she s on top ... because sex .
- - schwartz looks like he has nt missed a game
  - I know right      Super pumped .
- - Yes . I know the Army is not a popularity contest  but if you want to have friends you need to be able to talk shit and take it too .
  - Honestly it s true with any group of men . Its surprising that this is something that has to be explained
- - I was expecting this to go in the direction of you losing a finger ...
  - I really thought their username would be relevant here .
- - this has to be a straight up parody of shaft anime right
  - That d be Yuri Kuma Arashi  which has a staff full of past Shaft members .
- - You re still not allowed to offer on PC threads . You can PM him if you want  but do nt offer on PC threads ...
  - Did nt really think of the PM feature  fair enough that would have been a better idea .
- - And India recognizing Palestine and not Kashmir is legitimate  Besides  I do nt care about political games orchestrated by oil rich Islamic shit holes .
  - This has nothing to do with Islamic countries . The vast majority of states and humans on earth who support Palestine are not Muslims .
  - I d support Palestine too  as long as they would nt want to blow the hell out me  my friends and my family .
  - Nobody s asking you . You do nt represent anybody except yourself and do nt have legitimacy to recognize countries . Nobody cares
- - It s not deodorant  it s hairspray  made by bedhead . My ex has the same stuff  and I also thought it was a dildo

  - This will help me design my death maze .
- - Going all-in to win it back is never a good idea .
  - This . Please do nt all-in  kids .
- - I ve witnessed an electrocution and lethal injection . Working on the inside  I have transported several death row inmates to the death house
  - I m sure you have some very interesting stories 
- - I see you activated your hipster beacon .
  - It was a lapse in self respect  I ll admit . For the record I only posted it on facebook . So I ve got that going for me .
- - Oooh  I did nt see that .
  - Seeing as the armour is alive  then no one is inside it and the Imperial Arm itself is posing I suppose 
- - Ah  I love it . They re getting extremely sloppy .
  - How  The pulled article had no evidence . Was just based on conjecture . Even the author admitted as much in the conclusion .
- - I d bet a lot of money that young white men commit more violent crime than old white men .
  - Probably because the violent old men are now in jail .
- - WITH is that  I played through that game and I do nt remember running into those things . They look like Grevious  species .
  - Terror Troopers  those stupid things that teleport behind you and are impossible to hit  their in the second game .
- - Great technique on the ball cupping you mam are a professional
  - Agreed  Far too often the balls are ignored .
- - But why plow a pond  Ice fishing 
  - Neighborhood kids go ice skating on the pond .
- - Who s the chick with the Katana 
  - Katana No  that s actually her name
- - Hellboy  Shrek and Thing are good guys right 
  - As is arguably Frankenstein s monster . This is a bad comic  though well drawn .
- - good effort . that bom bom song in the first half was great .

  - Do you even realize you are using rhetoric when you do it or are you that far gone 
- - You can perceive a fantasy just as well as you can perceive reality .
  - You can  but reality is still more important than fantasy . Real food is more nourishing than imaginary food .
- - I m gon na go with Canadian on this one . A hockey stick is just a better weapon than a bottle of whiskey

  - Rollerblades on feet  of course . Now duel

- - I am pretty sure he is talking about the scene at the parents lunch . Idk why everyone is thinking it is this scene .
  - People are probably confusing Schmidt and Jenko  I also thought it was this one before I remembered who was who .

  - Who knows ... Could all be internet bullshit . Considering they still show up on pornhub and other larger sites it seems unlikely .
- - Maybe You Get Bad Customer Service Because You re a Bad Customer
  - Hands down one of the most ignorant comments I ve ever heard ... Millions of customers and their singling me out as a bad customer to treat poorly lol

  - I used to live in Minnesota and I came here to say this 
- - Did Muhammad wear a turban  I thought that was Sikh Indians .

- - Please update on if that new NY works
  - Premium said it wo nt  so it likely wo nt  but I ll confirm .

  - my bad  i read that as do  instead of do nt

  - It s an ad  so it s not going to appear every time .
- - Damn that s nuts . This is going to be the longest arc in One Piece by a significant margin . I wonder if any other arc will top it .
  - Probably the final arc  but who knows 
- - Where is this trail  I assume it is in New Jersey  because of the license plate .
  - Id be interested in knowing  too . I havent run any trails in NJ  just PA .

  - That kills the no makeup part of it
- - if you could look like one character that you voiced in a game who would it be 
  - That s a toss-up ... Joker . He s just got style .
- - Once again do nt want to offend your pretend country  but where I live  we do nt have the court of public opinion .
  - I live in the US  where we absolutely do .
- - Dammit  TNT tonight . If Chuck is calling the game I m going to have to watch on mute and just mentally add Clyde and Breen commentary .

  - Couple buddies want to cheese . Just need the CP or you can join in

  - I think she changed her clothes and put her hair down . Not much else to see .
- - why is walk the moon so low  and YEA  ghost beach is my shit .

  - Well then there needs to be a better title .
- - I nearly had to stuff my alpaca in my mouth to keep from laughing . Good thing my SO sleeps like a log . How did the dad react

  - you re an idiot . that is all .
- - I understand it s kinda frustrating  but the courier ca nt do everything for you . A mic will help your cause .
  - Actually it can  since this is a video game .

  - The same way . The person in the screenshot has nt activated teleporting there with the seed  for some reason .
