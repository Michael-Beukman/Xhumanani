  - Well he s in one episode  but he shoots House .
- - Thanks . Ca nt get more definitive than that .
  - I think it can get a lot more definitive than an unsourced tweet .
  - It s not an unsourced tweet . The NBA spokesman is named and the tweeter is the beat writer for the Atlanta Journal Constitution .
  - Unsourced as in he just says that he said it without a backing article or video or anything .
- - To be fair I ve only seen that rule in Dubai  never in other GT championships or standalone races .
  - Looking over the regulations  it says nothing about maximum lap times . Seems like a free for all
- - With such a defensive game  that punt hurts the Cards a lot ...
  - Our PB caliber punter is gone for the year too .

- - Rome defeating Carthage . That one is kind of important .
  - could you go into a little detail about how it changed the course of human history 
- - Steve Nash . Is nt it bed time in the retirement home

  - Feel free to ask me . I ve dabbled and and currently engaging in a lot of those things in my career .
- - If you stick with Donald till the end  he becomes a demigod . It s ridiculous .

  - True  when push comes to shove  at the end of the day  it was what it was .

  - Oh u know the rules if I sleep you do nt touch me .
- - What bike you on  No one be following you through that route
  - Cheers  Its the beastly Shitzu Hakuchou  ive had many try follow when ive had bounties  they usually just give up if i can go long enough without crashing 
- - Just asking . My wife and I are going to start tacos for threesomes . I want to know how much I ll need to buy .

- - Ebay has buyer protection that overrides seller return policies if the buyer claims that the item was damaged
  - Ahh  so its a buyer exploiting the system - That s unfortunate . I ll have to keep this in mind .
- - Javale is still a player on our team  Gallo is becoming injury prone  our system and our players are not exactly the best it could be .
  - becoming  when was he not injury prone 
- - Interesting  but minority does nt really change my view . I am not trying to be a dick or anything btw
  - But your post implies that if not forced upon people in childhood  religion would cease to exist . A minority proves this to be incorrect .
- - Only with his chakra cloak though  which he can actively summon . Seemed to be a concensus in past threads too .
  - Okay  that sounds about right . Cool .
- - The satire will go way over everyone else s head .
  - Nothing goes over my head . My reflexes are too fast  i would catch it .
- - Guess I missed those then . Got a bit distracted .
  - How dare you not be attentive for every second of the game  sheesh
  - I guess I was still kinda right though . Is nt he still perfect from three 
  - You are correct Sir . However  the answer would still be no probably .
- - Why would nt he I guess is the real question . Valinor sounds bomb .
  - You d miss your friends and your home 
- - that s some perfect facebook sticker usage  OP .
  - I could nt put into words how weird his comment was . The Facebook sticker encompassed it all .
- - That would nt work as the champion would just get themselves to really low health from minions or something and become OP .
  - would nt you risk getting killed then  It would stack very slowly at safe hp levels . You have to be in combat to get stacks
- - And shrek has video cams placed everywhere in his swamp  Why do you think this is worth doing  What makes this idea worth following through with 
  - Whoever makes te game would make the story since I did nt cover it . I just thought it would be a funny game
- - Round em up and send them to work camps .
  - We already tried that  but did nt work .
- - Well ... anyone starting to doubt Luck can shut up now .
  - Its amazing what time in the pocket will do . Now if we can eliminate the drops .
- - I tought mister Neuer was the golden boy on the team .
  - Neuer is amazing when compared to other keepers  but you ca nt compare Neuer s impact on the game to Messi s .
  - So there is the reason he does nt deserve a ballon DOr .
  - To be fair Alex Meier is more important to our team than Messi is to Barca I d say the Ballon goes to Frankfurt 
- - Just suggesting that Reinhart lent his guitar playing hand on that particular tune
  - Ahh  gotcha . I m with box  I ve never heard of this guy .

- - Still waiting on an official comment on his T . E levels .
  - Certainly will be interesting to see how this whole situation unfolds .
- - I really REALLY want to vote for Teddy ... But OBJ single handedly turned that team around .
  - Look at OBJ s video compared to the rest  even NFL.com really wants him to win .

  - What evidence do you have that rationality is based on evidence 
- - yeah im not american but i thought he was a big deal considering he s won a gold medal or something
  - Honestly now he is probably more known for being mixed up with the Kardashians sadly .
- - What was in the oven then  Could nt have been the dog if she was stuck in the bathroom . What kids  I m so confused .
  - Sorry  tried to edit for clarity .

  - Thanks man . I just know they get pissed off if you do nt directly post to the site  and well they deserve the traffic anyway .

  - Wait  how is he bigger than kg
- - Great work by McDavid there with the assist .
  - It was a great pass as he s being knocked down .
- - I really hope she s the next danyka nadeau  i love her voice
  - Stonebank is her husbando  I do nt think she ll do it
- - Without hesitation  the score is the best single element from the prequels . Not the story  not the acting  not the effects .
  - Not just the music  but the whole audio is top notch .

- - Given that the existence of Jesus is somewhat lacking in evidence  I find this difficult to believe .
  - All the claims can be doubted except one . This will be extremely profitable for the museum . That is certain .
- - Its quite nice this morning by the way  very clear and not too windy .
  - Aye  its not bad . I m on my way to the gym . There seems to be a lot more traffic than normal .

  - Haha I remember you  we loved your psn name . We switch lobbies after every game to spread the love . Gg though 
- - why do u feel the need to hide ur name  do nt think there s any harm in revealing it ...
  - He did nt do a great job of it either  the black overlay is nt opaque .
- - What kind of map drawing style is this  Where could I find a collection of other maps having a similar feel

  - Ouch ... These are just off my main tank so I have new ones coming . lol
- - I just hope og dont get rally overconfident .
  - I feel like their problem is being under confident . They always seem to be second guessing themselves and end up losing momentum .
  - Nade said they were over confident on Friday and that s why they lost . They underestimated their opponents
  - Fair enough  That probably is true but you re not going to let people know that you were nervous .
- - I bought my dress today too  Yay for us 
  - Such a great feeling is nt it 
- - This is a gamble pick . Mariota goes first but what team will take a chance on him 
  - I can almost guarantee you Winston goes before Mariota .
- - He s right  but that can be said about most every hobby . Normally the only people who think it s cool do it .
  - When people see something they ca nt do  they just assume the people who can do it are just weird .
- - How are you finding flying it  I have a hell of a time with mine .
  - Casually flying it around  it seems perfectly fine and what I thought it d be like . Unsure about in combat  I ve mostly been goofing off with it .
- - ITT . Guys who support the porn industry with their time and money  talking about how wrong it is for women to make the videos they wack off to .
  - That s a non-sequitur . Even if you love Wrestlemania  you do nt have to live their lifestyle or marry one of the fighters .
- - That sounds like most governments . EDIT . Gold yay
  - Yup  this sounds a lot like Australia
- - The sound of a headshot in Call of Duty . World at War .

  - Personally my favorite is dancing on the archon priests cell while dinklebot is asking me if I m sure I want to do this .
- - Yeah  but why would you have SGA equipped during crota 
  - You would nt . But thanks for helping me out .
- - The costco model works in person  no one cares about wholesome and nice online .
  - Then why does Costco have a website  And why have I spent at least a couple thousand dollars there between the past two years 
- - I wish library writers would abstain from jQuery so that I can use your lib without an unnecessary dependency . For everyone else  use whatever suits ya .
  - Then they ll just end up including an ad-hoc buggy reimplementation of some fraction of jQuery in their lib ...
- - I just think there s a difference between refusing to bake a gay man a cake versus making a gay wedding cake .
  - Baking the cake in no way endorses the marriage . All it does is endorse that your business will cater to the wants of the people .
  - What if someone asks a business owner to write the F  word about Jesus on the cake  Should nt the business owner be able to say no 
  - But they are nt . They want the same cake as a heterosexual couple .
- - I ca nt either . Beautiful bike . No idea why I love Repsol bikes but usually ca nt stand graphics and the whole bit .
  - Agreed . I normally hate graphics but I m a sucker for the Repsol plastics . Also love the way Hondas look
- - Casey Holmes on YouTube also has downturned eyes - she usually uses tape on the corner of her eyes when applying eyeshadow to help them appear more upwards .

- - My favorite part are the calf fades . That s amazing .
  - Haha thanks . I play a lot of ice hockey and basketball .
- - I think a good step would be to stop decoration placement under rollercoaster supports  yknow so they cant levitate ... I never understood being able to do that .
  - But this is an important part about making custom supports . Why would we want to remove that aspect of the game 
- - The red tones that stick out at night on the trees are the most annoying to me personally .
  - Yup  always looks like a camp fire from a distance .
- - We really need to get this kid a professional contract asap . I heard rumors other very big clubs are trying to poach him .
  - I read last night that we actually gave him a two year contract that he signed recently . Added bonus that it was after some interest from some scum .
- - Why are atheist so angry  I have yet to met one people actually enjoy being around .
  - Who s angry  You think I ca nt post about how people are fools without being angry  Perhaps that tells us something about yourself .

- - Have you tried deleting the app and then re-downloading all the songs in your playlists  Worked for me when it got the hiccups once ...
  - Could I just resync all the songs from my computer 
- - This concept works for atheists as well as blasphemers . I can disbelieve in an unlimited number of deities all at once  It s very efficient .
  - That s so true . I m doing it right now and I still got time to do all these other things .
- - You could get a deposit receipt for doing this  and it s very easy to set up an electronic fund transfer .
  - You can get the deposit receipt  I m more talking about a rent receipt .
- - Is there any lessons you ve learnt from your previous climbs that you re gon na put to use in your next project 
  - preparation  especially mental toughness is really the key  assuming I have the base level of physical conditioning . Also a ton of little things like hydration .
- - They were brave to pen and publish the cartoons . Heroes is justifiable in my opinion .
  - Agreed - there will be numerous publications who will now write in support of Charlie Hebdo . But very  very few will dare to publish Charlie Hebdo s cartoons themselves .

  - Do you have any documents or citations for this claim that he s heard of hyperbole  Maybe you re a little slow in the head .

- - The funny sweater distracts from the cute face .
  - My sweater is badass and nothing less 
- - NoFap should nt be about not fapping . It should be about bettering your life and not thinking about fapping .
  - For a lot of people that is their goal . Not everyone though . Some people are not quite down in a hole like many of us .

  - Well we look pretty much the same . You would nt be able to tell from the photo if it is or is nt him . And it s my license .
- - Not once . I chose her  she chose me . There is something incredibly powerful in that .

- - Woahhh  I think you did a super good job blending  The lipstick shade is perfect too . I love it .
  - Thanks  It s the first liquid lipstick I ve tried and I am IN LOVE and feel the need to collect them all .
- - I know it s an actual book  but we both know they put that in huge characters on the front page as clickbait .
  - Um  yeah because the premier for the series was tonight ...
  - I must admit I do nt watch TV .
  - I watched it . It s actually pretty good . A bit less in your face than the book  but that s expected I guess .
- - Brussel Sprouts are actually good steamed . Even better lightly seasoned . Maybe I just have vegetable privilege though .
  - Cut them in half and broil them with olive oil and pepper until they brown up a little bit .
  - Do nt forget the bacon . Well turkey bacon because we re being healthy here

  - I thought it set up the idea of Batman as an immortal symbol really well .

  - I mean  they re only dominating because FSU ca nt hold onto the ball .
- - Kelly Wells . She even did two extreme puke scenes with Max Hardcore .
  - Can you share some of her stuff  Preferably not the Max Hardcore ones though haha .

  - Same here  I go to every store in the city itself and all they have are commons ...

  - Yeah  Lands End is pretty amazing for working out a good style and fit of bathing suit .
- - Welcome to Oklahoma . I ve never been that close to one  but been through some serious shit .
  - Filmed in northeastern Nebraska actually . I live in Norman Ok though .
- - Calculated obsolescence . Things are made to break or wear out so that companies can keep making money .
  - They re also massively cheaper because of this . Why do you think Walmart sells the crap that they do 
- - Does anyone apart from our offensive line have a real reason to not like this guy 
  - I do nt like him because he acts like a total dickweed to people when they have the audacity to have fun
- - So ... when can I get the torrent file 
  - I m all for supporting the Avatar creators but hey  this is the best quality I ve ever seen regarding ATLA . We needs it . We needs it now 
- - Do well  Be good . Kill people  do nt die .
  - This sounds strangely familiar to something I hear on NPR ... would this be a play on that 
- - Damn that still looks like a forward pass to the naked eye .
  - Adam Schefter was at that game and still to this day swears it was a forward pass . I like Adam Schefter .
- - I thought it was out . Please do nt hurt me
  - I thought it might have been  but on review I still think the batsman should have got the benefit of the doubt .

  - Yeah  as a kid I was always without because .
- - Pssh  the true fan watches from midnight  slowly ruining his sleeping pattern and life
  - I lost plenty of sleep watching Bangladesh vs. Zimbabwe .
- - Your correct  but until the rules do change saying that they should be changed is not justification enough to keep breaking them . Anarchistic logic effects every one
  - Yes  but the woman in the picture is asking for a change of rules .
- - surely if you re not at the equator and it s winter it s sensible to adjust for reality .
  - From the Northeast . Can confirm . Please be rational and do nt die .
- - This is shocking . A punch in the gut for me ... He left behind a strong legacy and will not be forgotten .
  - I know  I did nt even know he had it . Very sad
- - They might be waiting until post playoffs .
  - That s what I was thinking given the first playoff . But figured I d check in case .

  - Exactly . It s just an extremist minority .
- - Orlando is nt exactly FSU s back yard but I suppose the point stands .

  - Oh . I see . I should ve phrased it better ... poop . Maybe I ll resubmit 
- - GTS is full of lies man There are good people that are honest  but only a small percentage
  - I used the GTS a lot when I was completing my Pokedex and I got plenty of regular stuff  first time I was trolled by Pokemon I guess
- - no  they cancel each other out .
  - That s a shame . Do you know why this happens 
- - I could nt agree more . The ads are annoying  Especially for paying for Hulu Plus .
  - I know right  Is this ad relevant to you  No . Are you still gon na see it every other time there s a commercial break . Yes .
- - There are a couple of christian African countries that have FGM too . It really is a regional thing  not a religious thing .
  - When religious groups are actively promoting the practice in the name of the religion then its a religious issue .
- - Whether or not Yeo is to blame  I do nt think he makes it through the next week .
  - About a zero percent chance he is canned any time this season .
- - That s a kid . While she is cute  THAT S A KID .
  - That s not a kid  that s Elf .
- - Is it so easy to hit a pilot s eyes with a laser  And does it represents a real problem for whom is hit 
  - Do nt have to hit te eyes  it scatters if it hits a window .
- - Is this chunk the chunk where your base is 
  - Right on top of it  yes . My enchanting table was swallowed by it as well as my cow farm . But my wheat farm and storage chests are untouched .

  - Funny how we rarely hear from people who quit their job over some terrible boss and end up homeless or living with relatives .
- - This looks like a Seinen story more than a Shounen story .
  - It s similar to Obata s style . The lines are kinda intense in a way not common to shonen .
- - Did you sell these online or irl  What brand were the ties 
  - Online  and they were made by my friend .
- - I ve only played video games of them . My family never played them or had them growing up .

- - I JUST SOLO D THE NIGHTFALL AND ALL I GOT WAS A PURPLE ROCKET LAUNCHER . I WANT TO DIE .
  - BUT IF YOU DIE YOU LL BE KICKED TO ORBIT .

  - Yup  A lot of biting at legs and flanks .

  - I am a carpenter  I do nt work with animals  I build houses and stuff .
- - Are you planning to stretch your earlobes as well  It would definitely suit you .
  - I had nt given it any thought  but now that I think about it I kinda want to 
- - That s a really pretentious thing to say . Do you have experience working in finance 
  - Yes and I think the market I got hired in was harder than today s .
- - Yes I know what neutrality is lol . I m not talking in official terms  but more so in terms of what country we are closest to and vice versa
  - Germany  France  Sweden  Austria .

  - He would be incredibly stupid if he did .
  - when it comes to Romo i get over protective  fucking broken ribs  punctured lungs  broken back ...
  - You are nt wrong to be honestly .
- - Tatsu is the most intense ride at Magic Mountain . Sadly  they never let me film anything there . They always yell at me to put away cameras on rides .
  - Yeah I have to keep it in my pocket until the ride leaves the seating area or else they take the camera away .
- - ah ... find any rares  BTW Welcome 
  - Just a lot of Mario  Luigi and Diddy . A lot of Peaches that had fallen off their stand .
- - Do nt tempt me . I have a pretty extensive MAL I could call upon to make a truly formidable list ...

  - That would be nice if she comes in briefly once and a while  so we do nt forget about her and the characters do nt forget about her
- - They applied  paid the full expansion fee  and were rejected .
  - I do nt think that is correct . At Raul s presentation they said they were not interested in the MLS model .

  - I m sorry  but your answer must be in the form of a gif .
- - I ve tried every angle and I ca nt seem to get it to scan the code ... sad times .
  - I ve found that turning up the brightness on whatever device I m using that has the code on it helps significantly .

- - I do nt want to get scammed lol ...
  - nah they are good and trusted people so no need to worry
- - The passages they posted are from Sept test for some reason .
  - Is that with everything though  My logic games are not the ones that were the real ones .

- - Dat macro algae is looking very nice . I have nothing else .
  - Lol  thanks  I do nt prune it as much as I should  but when it takes up the top of the refugium completely  then I pull some

  - I might choose the horrible death of drowning than having this kind of back pain .
- - I love sky full of stars  shooting star background  and mysterious forest clearing background
  - The Shooting Star Background looks like really low quality though when you put it on pets .
- - I think so . DGB is big and fast  in the Megatron mold . But I m not as high on Cooper as most .
  - unfortunately that s what they said about Stephen Hill
- - Blow the whistle and call a timeout . Ask them each . How ya feeling champ 
  - Funny because I used to do about the same thing and it actually got them to stop
- - Can confirm this one too  did it yesterday
  - Great . Its in the Next Gen Megathreads now .
- - They should send thier reporters to cover the Islanders
  - They already have a reporter covering the Islanders  Also  the Islanders do nt play basketball .

- - There was no bans or cooldowns handed out and games are not showing as a loss in matches  hopefully loss forgiven
  - In my game two guys got out with no cool downs . Then a third tried it and got a cool down .

  - Try to rewatch it with someone who has nt seen it before . That way  you can sort of experience it for the first time again through their eyes .
- - Uh  you could probably say this about any TV program  probably even local news .
  - Yes so the fact that one person s girlfriend has nt heard of a sports analyst is nt really a good indicator that he s not popular .
- - Turn signals  full stops at stop signs  etc . Basic driving etiquette
  - Too many full stops that should be yield signs in North America so I do nt blame them .
- - If the choice is between socialism and starvation even Americans should be able to swallow the former .
  - Yes  only until people are ragged in the streets will change come .
- - Why did you feel the need to do something so dramatic as burning the letter  What s wrong with just throwing it in the trash and forgetting about it

- - Those look amazing  I m coming to your house for drinks ...
  - That might be a bit of a drive xD
- - Did you remember to use cheap collision snow or did you just use viaducts

- - And you could only jump off of designated areas . This made me a bit batty .
  - Yeah  what the hell was the point of that 
- - Is there a video of the presentation  I d love to see it .
  - Libertopia filmed them all  no idea when or where the releases are .
- - I think that s a cow dressed up like a deer .
  - And then it forgot it was a cow because cows are thick and so its antlers falling off was a great surprise .
- - Are nt all Jedi conversation options built upon influence checks  If you re trying to convince Atton to be a Jedi with low influence  it absolutely wo nt work .

- - You  OP . For asking this question .
  - I always knew i d one day be recognized for my efforts
- - Your wife is fucking disgusting . How am I supposed to masturbate with this shit here

  - That s a fantastic idea . Bout to do that .
- - I m so sorry for your parent s loss .
  - They were happy they saved all that money on college .
- - Best supporting actor and the only thing worth seeing in the Godzilla movie is Bryan Cranston .
  - I d agree only because Cranston was the only good thing about that film

  - he is like part women  part horrible beast
- - Show them your porn history . No one jokes about their porn .
  - Depending on what hes into  it might do more harm than good 
- - Straw men are the worst . I totally get why Hitler hated them so much .
  - What I do not get is why he did not just feed them to his horses instead of burning them .
- - So  basically what you would expect .
  - Not exactly . I was actually expecting it to have more to say about how I do nt do enough around the house .
- - would you rather have a day with your three best friends or a day with your SO 
  - I do nt have an SO  so my best friends . Thanks 
  - i ll go again  crest or aquafresh 
  - I m a Colgate man . Never used Aquafresh  but I like Crest  so I ll go with Crest .
- - Imo Kadri  Nylander  Reilly are untouchable  Gardiner and bernier for a kings ransom . Rest of team is expendable .
  - I d add Bernier to the list of untouchables too . He is the best goalie the Leafs have had for a long time .
- - I would hope that there could be an option to keep location services on if an app is currently running
  - Most definitely  that would be a much appreciated improvement .

  - If you are quick enough you can sprint cancel and not start the sprint animation .
  - How do you cancel the sprint animation 
  - By reloading . Just kidding  I do nt know .
- - Does ... does he have a muffin top 
  - That s probably caused by his spine compressing .
- - Where is that sniper only playlist at .
  - Its actually a real thing in the new cod
- - I dont find it funny at all  but its a positive thing that they try to make fun of this kinda things .
  - It s hard for us to get it since we do nt speak Serbian .
- - His shoes are still on  so he must be ok .
  - Yes  that s the overused and annoying meme
- - I mean if that worked for Uther Pendragon  then I do nt see why it would nt work for him .
  - Well I don  think he is important enough for troll magic .
- - He s really never been one to flash a smile in a pic
  - You d understand if you had a crooked smile like Cole an me  fam

- - and some sloppy  stupid fouls your players got
  - There were some of those as well . Could definitely tell they were letting frustration get to them .
- - I would personally put her down as someone to avoid . Why does her personality type matter 
  - Yeah  I think I am missing the big picture here . Sounds like a catfish situation  honestly .
- - I m playing with the Requiem mod and with that much stuff I would already be walking slowly . And a decent amount of my weight would be just gold pieces .
  - Yeah  I always find it amusing that I do nt sink like a stone when I jump into a lake with half a million gold in my pockets .

  - The grizzly may have more potential but the moose is more likely to actually go ahead and do it .
- - They are literally torture porn . Judging them would be like judging regular porn .
  - I was thinking of the special effects used . The first two are pretty sadistic - some of the others are funnier .
  - I think the special effects are hypes up a bit . They were good  but it would take a huge amount of coke to make me believe they were real .
  - My problem lay in the sound effects used - the special effects were good - but the added in sfx made it obvious that it was nt a snuff film .
- - Either River Song or Ms. Frizzle . Edit . It was a joke  guys ...
  - Nope . It s an image from Human Nature . John Smith s love interest Joan Redfern .

- - IM GON NA SAY AGAIN THANK YOU RAMS FOR THE SEASON
  - I hope they move the Rams to London

- - Whenever I see these posts  its always the best looking girl that is the single one . I do nt get it ...
  - Probably cause there is more to a relationship that being good looking . I read that some place .

  - Awww man your so right  But with Ruin wings i believe that can be helped .
- - He ca nt be too smart if he d rather be a drunkard than work in the nfl . The redskins are taking a risk .
  - I feel bad saying this because alcoholism is a serious problem  but working for Snyder seems like a bad way to test your drinking problem .
- - Where is the light  I only see darkness . I half expected this ...
  - You need a lightbulb installed on your coffin

  - Roses are red  Violets are blue  They do nt think it be like it is  But it do .
- - It s far more com than rom but yeah  it was good .
  - Less rom  Y U do dis 
- - That play could literally be used as the biography of Tony Romo .
  - Mmm ... The kick hold fumble is still absolutely his biography play .
- - It s not understandable at all . The guy is a fucking man-child . He needs to learn some manners .
  - Well I can understand his frustration even if you ca nt . I m not saying that his reaction is understandable .
- - Which they obviously had the balls to do . Get some reading comprehension .
  - Crap  I responded to the wrong person . I agree with you .
- - Malone may be gone but Boogie needs to set an example with his play
  - Which is exactly what he goes on to say in the rest of his quote .
- - Unfortunately you re unable to pick up your own orbs even with Sunburst . Your allies can pick them up .
  - Thought so - thanks for the quick reply 
- - I have a Norwegian last name in the US . People derp pretty hard with all the vowels .
  - Oh man  Norwegian and Finn I m horrible at . I would butcher your last name for sure
- - We are officially in full off season mode .
  - You went full off season  never go full off season .

  - I will post exactly what the Sony rep told me when I sober up tomorrow  I promise 
  - Haha  sounds good man . I hope you re right . Going through the process of incorporation is something I d like to avoid for now if possible .
  - That s a bad idea . You should always insulate yourself from your products . Personally being responsible for anything is no fun in the unlikely event that it goes wrong .
- - ADC s are the best at taking all the credit for bot lanes success  while never being responsible for its failures .
  - This is the truest comment I ve ever read about bottom lane .
- - I had no idea competitive was so much fun to watch . That interception was CRAZY
  - Yeah he timed the boost to perfection  so clutch
- - Personally I take the bottom bun off the McChicken  got ta watch those carbs 
  - Yeah  Then you use the bottom bun  load it up with some fries and make a carb taco .
- - damn best of luck  hope he makes it
  - I m afraid that he s not going to make it . But thank you .
- - going out to eat and sitting next to a righty
  - Sit on his left . Have no righties to your left .
- - If he got his spotlight  he might be gone for good . I m comparing this to FFXI s Bahamut and AFAIK he did nt come back in later expansions .
  - Plus  it might be hard to summon him without all of the dragons kept in stasis doing so .
- - What did you do for a dressing 
  - You can use a little bit of sweet soy sauce .
- - He actually did nt mention it  and was very candid and entertaining telling old territory stories .
  - the vern gange stories and how was trying to get half of hogans cuts from japan was interesting
- - Meh I still think if you say Uzi is better than Namei you re pretty bad
  - I never said that nor will I. I ca nt have an opinion on who s better because I do nt watch LPL enough but I do watch international tournaments .
- - Ah an San Andres I have nt tried . Nice choice  cant wait to try it . Congratulations 
  - Yeah its pretty tasty hope you like it .
- - Always a good idea to win over the fans of your new club
  - He could teach Fat Frank a thing or two .
- - At first I did nt realize what sub I was on and I was like holy shit it kind of looks like dickbutt  what are the odds 
  - Same  I has like half way done before I realized what sub I was in .
- - Dont even know who that is or who s talking about it lol
  - You re better off that way . Want some Arby s 
- - I am not the OP in the thread  but thought it may make for an interesting discussion .
  - You are certainly the OP in the thread . You re also crazy ... like a fox . Nope . Wait ... Just crazy .
  - I did nt realize that was optional for Green Bay and Chicago fans .
  - Beer and brats is required for all nfl fans .
- - Can you do this in a custom game 
  - Yes  I just did got the achievement .
- - So  someone ca nt complain about being made fun of in this free speech utopia of ours  Interesting circle jerk we have found ourselves in .
  - Complain  yes . Kill people  no
- - I m not much of an art buff at all but I have an indescribable love for that sculpture .
  - I always loved it in pictures  but when I saw it at the Louvre  my knees buckled . I feel rather possessive of it .
- - You sir  are full of shit . Good Day .
  - wow real good contribution to the discourse there bud
- - And the attic insulation is all upside down .
  - To be honest I m glad it was that way so I was working on the backing not the straight insulation .
- - Are you worried about the bowing that s already happening 
  - Ya I m going to get some small shelf brackets to put down the middle .
- - Am I the only one that did nt understand what was so stupid about that  Sure a bit awkward but real life is awkward so what .
  - Yeah I m confused did nt it go according to plan  The first friend only says the beginning part and OP says the answer .
- - Next time im down in Lynchburg I m gon na hit you up .
  - Dude yes  Let s grab a beer somewhere downtown
- - Do you mind  Some of us are trying to have an adult conversation here .
  - Adult - translation . one-sided  immature  scary .
- - Same here idk why people hated the character development in the anime
  - I liked his development  the whole anime just falls off after that point .
- - True but the majority of creatures move along their axis of symmetry rather than perpendicular too it .
  - Yeah  that sounds reasonable to me  and a good way to phrase it .
- - With the way they look right now  will they even make it out of pool play  Jesus .
  - well ... everyone makes it out of pool play
- - Next you re going to tell me that that formatting was an accident ...
  - I bet he was too distracted from getting some awesome finger banging while he typed it
- - I kind of hate the finished product .
  - Not my style either  but it d fit in in any bar in Portland .
- - Gon na be honest  you do nt even know the weird shit I would buy if I was rich .
  - Do nt really care so it works out .
- - Awesome  Where does the model come from 
  - Cheers  This is a Hobbit Great Eagle  I just swapped the base .
- - Cause giving away lots of set pieces around the box is a top notch idea
  - To be honest  I feel like we are better at defending set pieces than we are at defending open play .
- - Can I buy a print  or do you have a higher quality copy  This is great .
  - PM me your email and I ll send you the original .
- - Do nt they know they can get a ticket for a rolling stop .
  - Certainly in California . I had a couple . Just not this kind .
- - This might sound bad but did he finish the narration for the eng dub  It would feel weird if he did nt finish the original series .
  - I m not actually sure . I d be grateful enough for him to have gotten as far as possible  and for a new narrator just as good .
- - Wow  that s awesome  Thank you man 
  - welll that was fast You re very welcome 
- - Finley just makes me think of Misfits ... And that is an odd show to associate with a baby . Lol
  - Ahaha Misfits is the first thing I think of whenever I hear that name too 
- - I think I m being brainwashed by your American advertising . I really want that garage door opener . I do nt even own a garage 
  - But just imagine how easy it will be to open that future one
- - The more I looked into this salty bet stuff  the less I understood . You re betting on people playing a video game named twitch 
  - It s AI fighting each other on a fighting game platform called MUGEN that you bet on  and the payout is pure pot vs pot odds based .
- - i wish we could get horse state-side . it s taboo and for some reason the fda frowns on it . from what i hear it is delicious .
  - In Italy I had braised horse ragu on fresh pasta  it was awesome 
- - How can they cheap shield each other  Did nt know you could attack a clan member
  - I m assuming with an alt account . Edit . actually  I was reading some other replies and I guess you can get matched with clan members .
- - Does smh stand for so much hate  
  - I thought that s what it was for the longest time 
- - She did not have sex . She was raped . That bears as much relation to sex as being strangled does to a hug .
  - Wow ... best analogy I ve heard all day . Cheers  mate .
- - Very interesting . I could actually see this being helpful ... is it possible to add a timeframe under it to see when each event happened 
  - If enough people like it  I will continue developing it . I ll write that down on my todo list  great idea 
- - As a Brit  you should be able to teach in Germany  but competition is probably very high .
  - Cool  I ll look into that a bit more then .
- - And my vas deferens just snipped itself .
  - RIP to your unborn children inside your ballsack .
- - That s what I was thinking  everything else is great though .
  - Lol really  I m tired xD gon na fix up the leader skill . Thanks for the heads up guys . Made him a raw crit leader .
- - For much of his life  Onions suffered with a stutter . Onions served in British naval intelligence where his knowledge of German proved a significant asset . Wut  O.o
  - What part of that do nt you understand 
- - Yep  his main account is banned . He s allowed to use a second one though and he s using this one for more than half a year .
  - why he get banned  i cant recall anything that got attention that could have caused it .
- - If you bought it at full price they are the same phone .
  - They are  I was led to believe the T-Mo version supports GSM only while the Verizon one supports both CDMA and GSM .
- - lol Well the prices are in another currency . So its not as bad as it first seems . p
  - Oh ok I walked and was like nope
- - I ll look at your offerings for sure . Can you send me info

  - Well  that s part of the black cloud
- - Ewwww  Wrong . Wrong . Wrong .
  - Its like . Its just one of those words ... that holds a weird sound in context . He thinks its hilarious . I m thoroughly disgusted .
- - Which is a completely different implication than what Aaron got .
  - which shows that Conan was really vague and careful with his wording  to the point of uncertainty .
- - they . are . AMAZING . waiters walking around with huge hunks of meat on swords .
  - lol ... thanks for reiterating why it sucks that there is nt one near me . P
- - If I was her mother I would move to Norway too . Or some other country that requires a plane to get too . Since she ca nt fit on one .
  - Norway is full of skinny people . I d be upset if they moved there .
- - By far  the winner is Dirty Dan . I laughed so hard when I saw it on the screen that I almost missed the first few notes .
  - If only there was also Pinhead Larry to match haha
  - That would be the greatest . I should tell my friend that we need to match names like that . c ;
  - Me and my sister  we had those names . But Pinhead Larry was to long  so that I had to use Pinhead as username . D
- - I think he s already alive again but nobody can tell because of the adamantium . Deadpool knows but he thinks it s funny to leave him .
  - If he is nt dead yet in that metal block  he would certainly die of boredom .
- - he makes me wet and I m a man
  - He makes me a man and I m wet .
- - This dude booing sounds like a cow that s been shot
  - Are you also on the spider cam feed 
- - It is about money  not necessarily about clean energy .
  - Yes but my point is that it does nt matter why they want Solar but the fact they do . Whatever it takes to reduce pollution is always fine with me .
- - Torrey Smith s biggest weakness is getting off the line against press coverage  where Browner obviously excels .
  - Glad I m not the only one who remembers this .
- - first day of weightlifting and you already have weightlifting shoes  lucky haha  I held out for a bit before I got some
  - I m a former professional power lifter . I ve had them for a while  they were great for conventional deadlifts when I was nt using enough quad .
- - Is that a response for pulling their ads from gamasutra because of the email campaign that gg organized  That is a pretty good way to wash the slate .
  - Yeah  I had still been irritated with them  but no more . Intel  I m making it official . we re square and a bit more than that .
- - Aw  real life is always so boring compared to the story .
  - It sadly is . Somebody posted a link to a site and there is a bunch of information that pretty much secures it . Boooooring .
- - You pay in time spent on ads  which to me is pretty valuable 
  - So you pay either way  and as long as the money goes to the artist everybody wins .
- - Not sure how I feel about this ...
  - I ca nt be the only one sick of seeing this phrase on this sub .
- - I do like the look of it but I do nt see any doors . Am I missing something or is the limo missing several somethings 
  - Concept art  the car has nt been built yet .
- - Downvoted until you edit in some punctuation .
  - is not essential to my point and if i cared i would so as you can now tell ...
- - We can only hope some History Channel personnel see this post and click that link . I would actually look forward to seeing that  but not on youtube .
  - Youtube app on TV . It s superb . No really  please watch it .
- - You would be correct . Good on you sir . How you knew that I have no idea .
  - Omg Haha  i have been there before  and it looked familiar  that s awesome that i got it right .
- - The smoke is nt really noticeable this far south  but the fire situation is indeed getting quite bad
  - Its nuts  hope a cool change comes in to settle things down .
- - None of the assistant coaches will be missed .
  - Woodson was speaking pretty highly of the DBs coaches . And our young corners seemed to pick up the position pretty quick .
- - Definitely . Plate flipper and a ticket straight home . No evasion charges yet and I d like to keep it that way
  - Ooh yeah  plate flipper would be nice ... I m adding that to my winter tweak list .
- - They have conceded only one goal more than Chelsea and Manchester City this season .
  - And we have one less CS in the PL this season than both teams as well .
- - I know . Mario s my dad .
  - I m happy that Mario and Peach finally got it on for you  but my DM is not related .
- - I still think it s weird Bambina is just completely red .
  - I do nt like it either  but that s what they put out there .
- - That would end bad because christians get offended and butthole easily
  - That is why you begin with a polite request for them to stop .
- - Sounds like you re an advocate for teaching children about gun safety since they re so prevalent in our society . Seems reasonable to me 
  - Im an advocate for REQUIRING anyone who owns a gun to learn gun safety . Anything less is irresponsible in my opinion .
- - Please seek the help of a mental health professional  mate . It may cost  but it ll probably work out in your benefit in the future .
  - I guarantee it s cheaper than drugs .
- - Definitely disagree  my LHBS does a fantastic job maintaining their mill .
  - My LHBS has an absolute beast of a mill that is well maintained  too .
- - i love bro safari  but i couldnt do mc sharpness during his set this past year .
  - He was nt as bad as the MC for Andy C. My god 
- - We have some strange laws on bringing glass into the state . This is how they put tommy chong away
  - Ahhh okay thanks for the heads up brotha
- - Fair enough but sorry bud . Bother the Merriam-webster and oxford English dictionary audio pronunciation is the hard g sound
  - I never actually said which pronunciation I think is correct  I was just commenting on the logic .
- - Do nt know much about boxing  but why does Mcgregor keep his right hand out  Is that a technique or is that to mess with his opponent 
  - It s about controling the opponent s hand I think .
- - It s never too late to start . I ca nt count how many businesses I ve tried opening before I found the two that made me money .
  - I tend to lose motivation when I do nt get instant gratification  I ve failed on some businesses and have nt fixed my discipline issue yet .
- - Last time a bunch of racists and sexists this fucking hateful united under a single banner with the dream of changing the world  it was called the Nazis .
  - They are even worse . The nazis at least payed close attention to the mental health of their subjects and propagated healthy lifestyle .
- - One less Iron Born to fight ... Pick him 
  - One less active Iron Born to fight . They ll still have em as NPCs haha
- - Yea it s not stealing . It s a dissolving a bussiness relationship . This is no different then two people opening a bussiness together .
  - And this is why people are nt getting married anymore .
- - Well I can see how much us SC guys are appreciated ... lol
  - I m actually orginally from Summerville . To be fair in Raise Up he shouts out SC . It s just super hard to find hype tracks about SC .
- - Why do fangirls go crazy over guys that they will never get 
  - That s just it ... they are crazy .

- - That is a fucking safety you fucking pricks
  - Whoa bro calm down you re winning . Just breathe with me . Ready 
- - Zach had major heat from backstage at the time . I am sure lots of people were happy to see him beat down so much .
  - I had nt heard that before . What is the story behind it 
- - And then it tracks you as you get up to go to the bathroom and everyone else in your living room is staring at the back of a TV .
  - Well you d have to turn motion control off ... or watch the tv from the bathroom with the door open .
- - Am I the only person in NA who has nt got a skin yet 
  - nah  I havent gotten one yet either . Takes time i guess
- - American here ; can agree with the second part wholeheartedly . I use foreign news sites for everything now because we do nt have a channel that s even Remotely impartial
  - Which sites  I m trying to keep up with this too .
- - If they do nt you can always go to a Stone Island store . They might even have them on the site still .
  - they do nt unless i missed it . i got some stone island camps about two weeks ago  but the link no longer exists
- - Where was the throwback logo item acquired  I would like to get one for myself
  - I was about to ask the same question .
- - Patriots are Eddie Guerrero . Lie  cheat  steal signs .
  - Everyone loved Eddie though . RIP Latino Heat .
- - That would be one odd looking cow .
  - I do nt pick cows based on their looks .
- - European thought crime laws are just despicable .
  - Yea like the new anti-porn laws in UK as well .
- - Excellent playcalling  Arians . That s the type of play you need to call for somebody as shitty as Lindley .
  - At least he has nt fumbled a snap like a certain player .

  - Okay  tbh I thought he d be quite the badass . He is human though  right 
- - I ca nt even handle this ... I m heading to In-N-Out right now 
  - Hope you did nt . It s gross .
- - Do they open  Are they makeup compacts 
  - The do not open . They look like they are made of porcelain or something like it 
- - Hm ... Maybe he s temporarily disabled . I will definitely do more research on that bot tomorrow and I ll implement those changes . Thank you 
  - Yeah  I think that bot also lets mods decide if he s not allowed on there .
- - I ve never won any contest of any kind  ever ... But I entered  Thanks OP
