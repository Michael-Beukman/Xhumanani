- - Rent an SUV and park it with a blue cop light on top . If people stop coming around  it s a drug house .
  - Then where am I going to buy drugs  though

  - Health was more of an issue that cost . I d still be happy even if I spent twice as much on vaping

  - The big bang and an uncountable amount of chemical reactions .

  - I would guess it took a minute to find a new job  which is smart to do before you quit .
- - That last bit is just poor writing though ; just because it s text based does nt mean the writer gets to spew all that stuff at players .

- - It s a good bike . I kinda like having one foot down  I usually have my left down and press the brake with my right .
  - Same here . Allows me to relax the throttle hand by letting up on the front break .
- - Is this real  Why not just use a coat hanger 
  - it s not real  they re trying to make a statement about the importance of abortion rights .
- - It s one of the rarer items from the out of print Lamentations catalog . On the upside  James has confirmed that he ll be reprinting it this year .

  - thanks  it s still very much a work in progress
- - A kids play  Is this how desperate people are to circlejerk about Russia .

- - This is like the Tower of Babel only this time we were retarded enough to tear it down ourselves .
  - Hey  why are you talking about the European Union now

  - I would nt say coward  I m thinking of stronger words .
- - Is Jeff as miserable and cynical as he is on the Bombcast 
  - Yes  it s every bit as hilarious as ever . Except he s even more cynical  because he s talking about WWE .
- - Would you care to show where the argument makes that assumption  He does not say it or even imply it anywhere in his post .
  - But what if I run out of tries 
- - if you have the printed out version  does it work for the self checkout  thanks for your help btw .
  - Yes the printed version work just fine .
- - The first image is right side up and say OM in Hindi . Can you post more images in that orientation

  - I think standing on the right side is only in Osaka and some other areas in Kansai .
- - Can an import work though  I want it bad .

- - aw no . I still love ding dong

- - And now you re comparing Indian people to dogs . Just fucking great .
  - No  he s comparing rapists to dogs .
- - you found a retail game at a retail store  great . ill see you on the front page

- - Very hard to see  considering you ca nt see the screen or the computer . It s just a picture of a kid  keyboard and joystick .
  - You can kind of see the computer ...  . X
- - The mods are extremely strict and the irc channel is even worse and is now deserted because of it .
  - How so  Like you ca nt talk about external websites 
- - I should have wrote the dog coughed it up
  - It s pretty clear what you meant .
- - That s a PI all day every day . Twice on Saturday .
  - No idea how the U missed that .
- - Also notice how all of the people in the wall of shame are fat
  - All fat people should be on a wall of shame .

  - Exactly . Family Guy is the opposite of a sitcom . The jokes do nt come from the plot  but the plot is an excuse to make stupid jokes .
  - When you think about it it s just a really polished  animated standup routine . And that s awesome .
  - Not really polished  you ever watch family guy on mute  Not exactly a shining example of animation .
- - Huh  it s never worked that well for me .
  - Maybe you did nt use it on something as ubiquitous as Neuschwanstein 
- - I have a windows phone and I check the search page every day because I love the pictures they post . This is a great one .
  - Yeah  That s one of the things I miss about my old Windows phone .
- - As a Cowboys fan from NJ  boy is that beautiful .
  - I threw up in my mouth a little  but whatever floats your boat .
- - Shit  people STILL use Deadly Dragons 
  - I m surprised this game breaking bug still exists . Any idea why it has nt been fixed 
- - Lol FSU still had a guy running off the field .
  - Some say he s still running to this day .
- - I m pretty sure there is at least interest because its evident they were talking about you  and you did make out as well haha
  - Yeah that s what I was thinking plus she was all over me the entire night . It might ve just been the alcohol but still .

- - Do nt forget you re here forever .
  - Back when The Simpsons was innovative ... GLORY DAYS
- - Now now now guys  turning down the Jets is something pretty much anyone would do .
  - Throw me a few mil and I ll continue the dumpster fire .
- - Wow . That girl sounds like a horrible person . Who does that 
  - She actually thought it was cheeky  cute and harmless - and I did nt do anything to scold her which is another one of my regrets .
- - Does the fact that North Korean s average penis size is two inches shorter than American s have anything to do with the current events between the two nations 
  - yes  most starving families cut the penis for dinner
- - How do I even get a flair 
  - Right . Side of page ... check off show my flair and then click edit to choose one
- - midway mart is the best beer store on the planet . perhaps universe .
  - Ah okay  so kinda like specs 
- - OMG  I get it  It s an ant  BECAUSE IT S ANT MAN  Marvel is so clever 
  - no . its because he a nt a man
- - I completely agree . I guess I should have given this a different name . I apologize if I mislead you . That was not my intention .
  - Oh no  no reason to apologize . Tis  part of the discussion .
- - Because we ve been socialized to believe that only the worthy deserve privileges  and if you re out of work you re not worthy .
  - Could not agree more . It also seems nobody who believes the same has a legitimate political voice . If there was a class war  we lost .
- - maybe he should nt have punched zai in the face
  - R U M O U R B O Y S
- - Well that s how the real world works . You ca nt just give up cause something bad happens .

  - Yeah  seriously ... what the heck are they doing  They re usually pretty good about getting a wide variety of shows per season .
- - every time someone posts ridiculous sun protection gear unironically i die a little on the inside
  - Even posts meant to be funny are not . They were  maybe  the ten first times . Now  Burn that bandwagon .

  - I thought something was going to happen near tri at the start  it did nt  I got sad  then I was made happy again
- - What in particular are you looking at  Politically  socially  economically  culturally  as represented in media

- - Great piece  made a similar one a few days ago and how safe are thoses sockets to use when there is some rust present 
  - A little bit of steel wool and you re set .

- - oh boy  Stewart is hitting the holes hard now
  - yes he is that looks like the young stewart

  - Assuming you re talking about the possibly unhealthy family rivalry  Lets just say if you do nt hear from me you ll know he ran me down .

  - cant tell if sarcasm ... will assume so .
- - Ones that I ve acquired over a very long career .
  - That make us a nightmare for people like OP .
- - No . Payment can be reversed and Google wo nt have your back .
  - This is also why it is also a very bad idea to use Paypal as well . They will almost always side with the payer when there is a dispute .
- - OH MY GOD . That is horrific . That looks like anchor worm disease to me .
  - Worst case of anchor worm I ve ever seen  This fish needs to be put out of its misery
- - Should nt this be tagged as a spoiler 
  - Because everyone has seen this show already .
- - You just described rape there  champ .
  - I read on TRP it s not rape if you liked it
- - How dare they to try to be fair an unbiased
  - Maybe they should have called the Russian penalties during the first period if they wanted to do that .
- - Welcome to the world of targeted advertising and links .
  - Yeah I feel stupid now LOL . Every link is to serial .

- - Really That s great  What is your major 
  - Yes  I m applying for a scholarship from the government of my country . I study civil engineering .
- - Thinking you ve lost your kid or sibling .
  - No joke . I work in retail and it s incredibly heart wrenching to see the pure panic in a parents face when they ve lost their kiddo .
- - My freebie gave me Jaraxxus who I needed horribly  so it was amazing
  - Nice  I m Jealous  have been waiting for Jaraxxus  no luck yet though ...
- - I think Jamie s aunt literally said to him that he was not tywins son . But no mention of tyrion
  - I would nt take that literally though .
  - Idk is nt Jamie n cerci older  If aegon took liberties with tywins wife at the bedding them two could be the result .
  - I still would nt take it literally though .
- - Maybe it s the other way around  Noticing what other people are thinking too much leads to anxiety 
  - I never thought of it that way . That would actually make a lot of sense .
- - How high off the ground are you 
  - Uh  just a couple feet I think
- - Maybe not say that someone you ve spent years with just was nt cut out for the job .

- - That s a really funny gif when you ve seen the movie  but kinda sad without .
  - I have nt seen it and I got a chuckle . Dramatic Leo s always good for a laugh .
- - How embarrassing that neither our QB nor our coach will let us pay them millions of guaranteed money to be on our team .
  - Marrone asked for an extension and was shot down by Pegula .
- - The only reason we have Haywood is because his giant contract is nt guaranteed and can be waived . In the summer he becomes a ten million dollar trade exception .
  - How awesome is that contract  I still ca nt get over it
- - Not at all  I did nt have many friends growing up  so I loved spending time with just my uncle in his basement .
  - Oookay  sorry  it s hard to separate serious comments from not sometimes xD

  - Abby would throw a fit and they d have to stop helping them . That s my head canon .
- - Awesome read . Super well written . I am running over to the sidebar right now to read all about dehydrated skin and make sure I am on the right track .
  - Thank you  I am really enjoying finally having the time to write 
- - I hope those long-winded intros start disappearing soon . They re not very funny .

- - Wo nt the crates still drop  but at a very low chance  IIRC  that s what happened with Robo Crates .
  - That may be the case  I have never had a robo crate since that event  but that does nt mean it s impossible .
- - Last airbender  wheel of time  fullmetal alchemist  yeah it s happened a lot . Which is why i do nt read as much anymore ...
  - Fullmetal Alchemist ... I went crazy obsessed after I finished it .
- - B dubs has a device called a Sound Dog that is a little speaker for your table  just ask your waitress  it really helps 
  - My brother works at BWW and he s never heard of a sound dog . Must be a select few that have this .

  - Would be more fair to set up even teams though .

  - That s how you get charged with a hit-and-run here in America .
