  - Shudder . Do nt take me back there please .
- - Haha  I hope your condescending reply which did nt even attempt rational conversation made you feel better about yourself for the new year . Godspeed .
  - The first sentence explained it  but I guess Gators are nt known for reading comprehension .
  - Well I guess if the first one did nt  your second condescending shitpost will get you through the new year . Really contributing here .
  - You actually think video game journalism is comparable to religious discrimination . I do nt know what you want me to say .
- - I m not sure how much more difficult  at the speed I finish by myself maybe lasting longer would nt be a bad thing .
  - If you re doing it hard and fast  sex might not actually be enjoyable at all

- - Let me think about it ... No . My answer is no .
  - then you have no right to complain . youre just as much at fault for the drama .
- - i stopped playing because it felt like garrisons is all i spent time doing besides raiding . Ashran wasnt very fun . Gearing up and bosses in highmaul was fun

  - No problem if you change your mind or wan na do less mags just pm me
- - Why is this in English  Why would nt they do this in Norwegian 
  - I have no idea ... I guess it is hard to be McConaughey in norwegian 
- - Is anyone expecting anything out of this 
  - Well  I m assuming they need food aid again .
- - Does nt the sling get in the way of spinning it  A single action revolver you ca nt spin is pretty well useless .

- - Why is nt our new top six winger playing 
  - He s on a plane . That ll be hard to play from there
- - I didnt intend for any negative sentiment . EMT course was by far the easiest and in my opinion boring part . The fun really begins when you start practicing .
  - Oh then I apologize  I misunderstood 
- - This is the jack chick theory of things . The only reason someone is nt Christian is not having heard of Jesus .

- - Is this an abortion joke or just a weird way to strangle a kid 
  - Well it was an abortion joke to begin with  but I like how you think
- - Check back with them regularly . They may get the item back but they might not contact you and it could be sitting in the evidence room .

  - I d really like to know the answer to this as well ... it looks amazing
- - Does he cut between his toes  and put it there 
  - Nah he butt dips  hes into economics ...

  - Maybe it is  Again  I m only referencing Solas  end game card . It very may well be just a bear
- - Or it was posted on Neogaf which gave this video a much higher visibility than his other videos .
  - It s a controversial subject so there are going to be a lot more comments as there is a lot more arguing .

  - Oops  sorry  I just saw that the others said the same 
- - It s so cheap . Now I m butthurt
  - I do nt believe it s any cheaper than the initial release . I remember paying the same for mine .
- - Christ  delete your fucking comment or edit it . Everyone in this thread is telling you that you re spreading false information  and you re perfectly content with that .
  - I have nt been online since making the comment . Yes I made a mistake  I ve edited the comment .
- - I probably wo nt know or recognise anyone  so I ll be wearing a black tshirt with a red pocket 
  - At least you know a few people now . I sat next to you tonight 
- - Ya I thought that it would be too small for my Xbox but it fit perfectly . Hopefully it will be ok to run  if it is I will be overjoyed
  - you d have to have fans sucking out the heat right out of there for it not to reenter through the xbox and overheating it .
- - Like I said  hit the button up top there that says optimal  and switch to standard  mode .
  - Ha  You fixed it . Thank you .
- - I think I saw somewhere that vargas is a girl . I do nt know if that s been verified though . Not that it would change anything .
  - That would explain why I ve had a particularly hard time convincing people I m vargas when in person
- - i tried they said it was a civil matter ...
  - A theft is not a civil matter . The debt is a civil matter . Just call them and tell them that your dog has been stolen .
- - No . Just a screwball which you assume is a woman  huh .
  - Well it does look like feminine handwriting to me ...
  - Definitely looks like a man s handwriting to me .
  - It looks like they wrote with their hands .
- - Mongolian hot pot is also very good . The flavors tend to be spicier .
  - Mongolian hotpot with lamb is my favorite .

  - I have the saitek pro flight controls . If Microsoft made their own that worked well I would probably use them too .
- - If I can wait for new HxH and Shingeki no Kyojin  waiting for Bleach is no problem .
  - Honestly Bleach hiatuses are nothing compared to HxH hiatuses . This just gives me a chance ti kook at the other manga out there .
- - I dont know  im just a grumpy jerk in general
  - Probably because of that devil butt hole .
- - the theory shaming in this sub is out of control
  - Can you set up an experiment to verify that conclusion 
- - That background and those icons make it seem more like iOS than Android .
  - It s an ipad clone  it s supposed to look like iOS
- - Leviathan and Iron Juggernaut are both garbage . Levi is definitely worse though .
  - What s funny is that I ve played iron juggernaut more as a mage than I ve played flame leviathan . Unstable portal op

  - I would love to see that game .

  - That explains everything  thanks a lot 
- - If the government loses why should you pay court cost  The police should pay the court cost as a penalty to teach them on how to right a ticket .
  - The argument is that the court still needs to get paid and you re the one that took it to court .
- - I wish commentators would stop being all lol GTech passing . This team can pass 
  - They do nt like to pass  but when they elect to it works .
- - Ooh that is so pretty  Great glam 
  - Absolutely  I am so pleased with this prize 
- - Hell  my guess is the Kinda Funny Crew will likely do some freelance contracted stuff for IGN semi frequently and probably appear as guests on IGN podcasts a lot .
  - Greg and Colin will continue doing Podcast Beyond as freelancers . Well  until they find good replacements or IGN says no .
- - why ca nt I be upset with both  Both are still wrong .
  - I tried to imply that . It came off as bigotry is fine to some people .
- - It was fireworks . I could see the sparks out my window .
  - Thanks  What a strange thing to do in the rain .
- - Can I ask whether that s a normal thing culturally  And what are your reasons for doing it  If not too invasive
  - Yeah I d like to know too . Also what are your jobs 
- - Just find out where the server is located  then use a ping test to a server in a location close by to get an estimate .
  - thanks But how can i find the server 
- - Never . I do nt swat at bees and when they land on me I instantly freeze . This is amazing because they freak me the fuck out .
  - So you re like one of those goats that lock up . Except you re not a goat . I think .
- - my theory is that tyrion payed them more beforehand to refuse to take payment from podrick .
  - Makes the most sense . The reward was giving Pod a huge self-esteem boost rather than just getting him a few hookers .
- - But guys  I did nt catch it  what network is Banshee on and when does it premier 
  - Cinemax . It has been on for a while . I caught an episode once  it s not bad .
- - It was a tongue-in-cheek comment . I had hoped that it was pretty obvious . Guess not .
  - I was nt attacking your comment . Just adding to it . She s odious .
- - Supposedly the image is much higher quality due to the more powerful image processor . Care to comment 
  - Yanno I have nt taken it out yet . I ll give you an update when I do .
- - GO FOR IT edit . man  I should be a coach
  - In fairness  you re probably better than most of the WSU staff right now .
- - Awesome man . I sent you a request
  - Oh pff sorry hahaha I forgot to add the space in my name  I just added you I think the one you requested was the wrong ID . My bad 
- - Its not unsettling that I m losing cells daily its unsettling that I m one step away from dying of cancer daily .
  - That s not one step away  I m just trying to keep you from worrying needlessly .
- - I ca nt prove it  but this is a repost .
  - My uncle did this to my aunt pretty much every day at work until one day he shat himself - pretty well stopped him from doing that ever again .
- - I d say the far more significant factor is economic opportunity and liberty .
  - Agreed . A lot of these fundies are nt even tolerated in their home countries .
- - o now i get why people say ur the only hot girl on the thread
  - that is far from true tf haha but thank you i guess
- - Is that part of your custom loop 
  - Dumb question maybe  but could this be possible 
- - why is the case black in some pics and white in the other  what is this mindfuckery 
  - I turned off the lights for a good picture of the LED lighting .
- - Is it just me or is scrolling fucked on that page 
  - Yea  for me too . Twitter fucked up I guess .
- - Do you foresee any issues with the drop is passing stat from Kroos to Khedira  My play style is possesion and build-up play from midfield
  - Not really  because if your building up play from midfield with Kroos  one misplaced pass to the opposition then you re countered .
- - I m gon na guess theres not going to be a of of Bengal babies made tonight
  - Yes there will be  that s the only way they can score
- - I think you meant to pose this question to Christians right  To me  it reads as though you re asking other atheists . Just clarifying .
  - Ah yes that could be confusing . I am an atheist questioning how Christians believe in their religion with little visual evidence .
- - Add me  I do nt know what my pokes are  If you could let me know that would be great .
  - it says to me that your friend code is not valid . try checking it first
- - This article is based on nothing  and contains no other information than the author s opinion dressed up as science . It s awful .
  - Yea  I m really confused as to why mfa is swallowing this whole . There s no evidence here to support his theory .
- - Yeah  but traps are live after the turn you use Trap Stun .
  - You chain trap stun and the trap that they were gon na use fizzles out
- - While only partly tied to Dignitas  I thought Dig fans would be interested
  - Yep - I d say this is relevant 
- - I m guessing this is Garena HoN 
  - I recognize a few of those names  they re US players .
- - It forced me to interact with actual people . Glad it s over .
  - I hope this is supposed to be one of those weird joke that everyone pretends to be able to relate to .
- - I m just happy it s a shitty accord that s not a dually repost
  - Yup . It still came up not long ago .
- - A very nice list  I would suggest you add repositories though as some of these tweaks are nt on default repos .
  - I m actually about to do that now .
- - And that  kids  is why you always have at least two NS  each connected to the intertubes through a different provider .
  - For sure I got it now  Still not even a simple notice when providing services to a fiscal entity ...

  - It is not about selling  his contract is expiring this summer and it is not renewed yet and someone said it is so we shall see .
- - I often stumble over words and sometimes feel like I stutter  which makes me insecure about my speech . Especially in other languages than my native one .
  - You know more than one language  Come on  do nt be insecure ; be proud you re smart enough to communicate with different types people .
- - Help thwart warhammer thread thieves with this one simple trick
  - See the website that has X rattled

  - I agree completely  people are worried about it getting shut down and I just sat thinking the exact same thing as you .
- - Wow  these refs are fucking the Cards right now .
  - Are you kidding me  They have bent us over and raped us in the first half .

- - My wife . She s got it all . My heart still skips a beat when she walks in the room .
  - Is she behind you now  Type . For yes and  For no .
- - judging by your comment you have nt even seen a single warowl video
  - I m pretty sure he watched the AWP tutorial .
- - Why did they take the skin off  I was under the impression that for an area that large  removing the skin causes more harm and prolongs healing time .
  - I do nt know  but I m sure this hurts
- - Why the hell would nt you wear a suit  Okay  that s done . A blazer and lightly contrasting pieces would look good . What color is your blazer 
  - I have differing colors of grey  but they re all disgustingly oversized on me  you would not believe how bad .
- - Thanks for sharing . Nicely done . Subtlety appreciated . Not in your face blaring music like other ham-fisted videos .
  - Thanks so much . It s my firm belief that you can make a car video without dubstep .
- - I was waiting . For the cock push-ups .
  - you mean cock push up  cuz one is all you need .

- - Internet connection as fast as hardware can safely run .
  - I know . I m just saying if this were somehow possible  people would pay a lot of money for it .
- - I thought it was just Lorain facility 
  - That s because of the drop in oil prices . This is something different .
- - Thanks friend  I was in a rush to finish writing the comment and I did nt have time to edit when it came out wonky . Have an awesome day 
  - No worries  have a great one yourself . D
- - How do we know Wells has speedster powers  Sorry  I m new to the show  just finished the last episode today .
  - He healed fast at the end . It was subtle but noticeable

  - It appears to be a parody of yesterday s circlejerks about bad neighbours and uranium glass .

  - They are moving more towards having her sing now  rather than the older stuff that has screaming male vocals .
- - Thanks for all the help  I ll see if I have a spare PSU somewhere that I can replace it with to see if that ll fix it .
  - Check the capacitors first . This is a very common problem with machines around that age  and a single bulging capacitor is enough to kill a PC .
- - Fantasy football is only part of it . Its about the cash . The Rodgers  Bradys and Mannings are bringing in more than players like Bennett .
  - The Black Santa brings toys  not cash .

- - Yeah great point  they made a joke I hope they get expelled from school lose tens of thousands of dollars and have their lives ruined
  - A joke  What a steaming load of obfuscation .

- - I have a ton of single player games on steam  might try and use steam family share . Do nt know how his mom might feel about that though .

- - Why is everyone confused about pre ordering Shulk  Did I just imagine that I did it 
  - if you imagined it  then i did too . we can pick up our imaginary shulks together .

  - You get it at the two yard line and go from there . We screwed Tennessee out of a win last year because of it .
- - What exactly is WOTC s fault  The fact that a collectible item has value  Is nt that the point of a a collectible item 
  - Difference between a collectable item and a collectable item people use to play a game with is that it sometimes becomes pay to win .
