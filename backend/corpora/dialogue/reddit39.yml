- - that s probably not going to change since the GCHQ would like to sneak a peek 
  - I think he meant they ll benefit from the lowered congestion  not avoiding going through the UK .

- - I guess I just assumed the families just go automatically  but I guess they have to pay for all that stuff .
  - players have tickets to give out sometimes but that s it .
- - Shooting someone is definitely easy . Dealing with taking a life after is not .
  - Your logic is terrible  he did nt take a life he shot someone . Not doing anything after the fact is what took that kids life away

  - Not enough to warrant cutting it down  I imagine 
- - Damn Harris County Sheriff s Office  I was excited until they sent out the retraction .

- - Maybe Evans if we get a new cb .
  - Cant see it happening at all . Massive overreaction after a few poor performances .
- - What makes you so scary to others  Attitude or size 
  - I look like a tattooed bear  just this wide hairy fucker . My attitude is super friendly at the gym .
- - Easier to run sewage and the like under the road than it is under the sidewalk  where it could affect the shops and houses on the street .

  - Yeah but X-Y-Z sucks so screw them .
- - Maybe you should actually read them yourself . You know  instead of relying on the media for your answers .
  - You re right  i should go by paranoid FB users that post this every year instead
  - Or find out yourself  instead of using biased opinions
  - Opinions  Its either true or not . I provided a link that has the direct verbage used . I even posted multiple outlets that all reported on it .

  - Just when you thought you could nt do worse than Internet Explorer

- - I get messages from random accounts asking if I have any rp .
  - That same one has added me multiple times
- - I was trying to say that it really does nt matter how pretty your game is . If it plays like shit nobody will play it .
  - I thought as much and certainly agree . Was more adding on to what I said in case someone interpreted your comment a little differently .
- - So freaking what  It s not about opportunity  it s about desire . The mass majority of people who want to go into politics fall into this category .
  - The mass majority of people who want to go into politics do nt have the money to do so .
- - There is absolutely no scientific evidence that humans have a grasshopper phase at extreme ages . Absolutely none .

  - Sure  I missed that it was already posted .
- - If everybody continues creating their own games so that they do nt lag  nobody will ever be searching for a game .

  - This does sound quite delicious . I ll be doing this next time around .

  - It would be weird if you were nt .
- - what does one do with the nuclear waste then 
  - Well we COULD use the facility we ve had in place forever  but apparently there have been political road blocks  so we just keep things spread out everywhere instead .
- - Well  ideally no ... It s definitely not intended for that . But I give in to the meaty goodness .
  - I eat the bags over a couple hours usually . Is jerky really that weird to non americans 
  - Jerky is nt really that high calorie and it s mostly protein anyway .
  - But it has so much salt in it .
- - I knew for sure you were nt trying to be mean . I appreciated all of your help . Thanks again .
  - It s alright . That s what we re here for 
- - Because Arabic culture is held to lower standards than Jewish .
  - To be fair  one claims to be the chosen people and the other just claims to speak the chosen language .
- - Do you take pepto for the sides 
  - No  I just backed down the dose and made sure to take it only within minutes of racking out .
- - BS  I can totally take my pants off with my feet  just you watch

  - Ohhh . Mobile only gives me one .
- - Middle Eastern here . Intolerance is being preached every Friday prayers in most mosques  and always by most of clerics and mainstream Islamic figures .

- - Part of me still ca nt believe that Sugar Bowl happened . Too awesome .
  - Dude  you ve got to rewatch it . It s saving me money on drugs this year .

- - A . Sweet Hatchet bro . B . Why the fuck 
  - I think it was an animation in call of duty when you pulled a hatchet out . Was probably trying to imitate that .

  - I ll tell my boss this next time I m late  thanks .
