- - I honestly have most fun on my main ... but have you ever done any type of pures  or maybe start an iron man 
  - Ya I ve played osrs for about a year and have only had a main
- - You re good at this . Hopefully the Cardinals Gurley just to fuck over Seattle
  - They also need do develop a running game  and that starts with a running back .
- - Avoid it like the fucking plague . It will fix and highlight issues that were never there to begin with .
  - Seems fair enough . Glad I never trusted it
- - If that was your instinct you probably did lose a part
  - So you re saying he s stupid 
  - we re certainly saying that you are though .
  - I openly agree to that . Yes .
- - MDMA does nt really make you forget things . And it certainly does nt let you fall asleep in the shower a few hours later . My guess would be ketamine .
  - It can if it caused him to black out  I ve had friends do that before .
  - Maybe . Off one pill though  Even a triple dose should nt do that .
  - It would depend on a few things  has OP taken it before  how often  was it a first time  was it a stupidly strong pill 
- - Shhh do nt tell your secret lol .
  - Lol I m done working it  I figure I d let the community get down on it before the set goes out .
- - The French do nt need this advice . They already know .
  - Uh they signed their rights away a long time ago
- - Congrats buddy  BTW are you Brazilian  Cause if you are ... That username
  - lol nah I wish i was though  Brazilians are pretty awesome if you ask me
- - whoa - i ve never been here . is it free admission  edit . nevermind  just checked
  - not free admission  but the cafe is free to go to
- - Being annoyed or intolerant of stupidity surrounding you does nt make you racist ; thinking that the reason you do nt like your neighbors because they are black is racist .
  - To believe that all races are the same because someone told you so is ignorant .
- - Mine are the same way  takes a bit to heal but they do overtime .
  - My deeper piercings healed fine and actually are better to stretch in the long run .
- - HOME needs an acoustic cover . then i ll bawl my eyes out .
  - Does anyone know the chord progression  Or perhaps the melody in sheet form  I d attempt a shitty cover with friends if so .
- - Is the music from the game Bully  It sounds really familiar but I m not sure .
  - It is . I played the game for the first time a few days ago and I loved that song .
- - Scale  gotcha . I missed the smell of fresh ground beans  it s so wonderful .
  - People may be able to give you a ballpark of settings if you tell us the specific grinder you bought  also .
- - This is next to impossible  Barca cant sign any player this year so why would they let go one of the best players  this does not make any sense .
  - Do nt they have to if Messi wants out and Chelsea ponies up the fee 
- - How much prana do the Servants have 
  - I am only using the anime version of the servants . I dont know if that makes a difference
- - You re right  rob is wrong or delusional .

- - that was some neat jumps . Love it
  - Do nt u mean Nate jumps heh Dont Kill me
- - Do you have any ideas why it s turning red though  I ve never seen this on other people s wicks .
  - That s because other people replace their cotton regularly ... and trim that long lead also . I have no idea what i m even looking at with that build .
- - What if i told you I reached Onyx rank solo  No mic  all random teammates .
  - Reaching onyx is nt that much of a feat
- - To keep going with the metaphor  that s about the time I break out the hand mixer and whip up something all of my own
  - Japan makes so much more sense when you think about It that way ... Thank you
- - So  do you think that they will make him vacate the title 
  - I hope so  why would you want a coke head as an ambassador of your company 
- - it is not that i didnt see what u wrote . it just doesnt make sense
  - Oh i see you need vid allright 
- - tried this server out and seems friendly and good
  - i think i m gon na settle in this one
- - I believe I have done so  If I have nt  I can try again .
  - Give it a few mins . Sometimes the bot takes a nap
- - Would you agree that  all other things being equal  preventing a crime is always better than punishing the criminal afterwards 
  - I would say that one can easily go too far in trying to prevent crime and destroy liberties in the process  so not always .

  - Why  D . We had a small ceremony yesterday  but we re planning a big wedding later this year and we were gon na have purple for our color .

  - It s no MSG thats for sure .
- - My husband and I agree . Especially when we re sodomizing each other 
  - Struggle through it  We re here for you 
- - Umm  the poster also switches genders ...
  - the second story does nt mention the speaker s gender once
- - Got dem face genetics . Looks better with no beard imho .
  - Thanks  man . It feels super weird to not have a moustache to tweak though . Like a part of me is missing .
- - The counting baron and dragon as belonging to respective sides seems a little imbalanced .
  - I would agree a few patches ago  but with the way dragons work now  I think it s fine . It s too hard to call imo .
- - Well is nt this turning in to a fun debate ...
  - Apparently figured of speach are extremely difficult for him grasp . Good thing most six year olds understand them  XD
- - Thanks again man  got it in the mail today 
  - No problem man  glad I can help .

  - Thank you very much I m glad u like it -
- - I just noticed a drastic battery increase once I removed Activator to the point that I ca nt see myself restoring my phone for some time .
  - It s a trade-off . I m way too reliant on Activator to not have it installed  but can also confirm it can be a battery hog .
- - Middle Earth . Shadow of Mordor has been nothing but enjoyable and it s got a massive single player mode with a bunch of replay value via the nemesis system .
  - Is nt that supposed to be a LoTR game  I never watched the movies  you think I would enjoy it 
- - I do nt have much time for an FC trade right now  sorry 
  - I need to breed all of the HA ones first .
- - Unlikely  but possible . Talking thousands of dollars to be possible due to rune packs and the like .
  - Pretty impossible . Highest ranked players ca nt even beat toa hard
- - This paparazzi is pretty shit at his job  seriously she s literally walking around topless and this is the best pic he could come up with 
  - Most likely they took photos of her with her nipples out but they decided not to release them . Possibly scared of a lawsuit .
- - He was good at throwing parties at his farm . And  he can provide exotic meats  although  it s all gon na be goat .
  - That s fine  I personally consider goat meat exotic anyway .
- - It s telling you that you do nt look gangster enough for it .
  - Okay  I thought I was funny . Apologies .
- - True . Just seems like there s always so much love for zombies . I think a new one is coming out btw
  - Yeah  Dying Light looks pretty incredible .
- - It s stuff like this that makes me feel it s not even worth it to put myself out there
  - Trust me from experience . A hundred assholes is worth the one angel .

  - Tomatoes are red . Almost like a shade of ... SCARLET  OHIO STATE ARE CFP NATIONAL CHAMPS CONFIRMED 
- - That was in Bridgewater . I do construction and did a job last summer which was signs on dangerous rural routes which translates to every fun road in the state lol .
  - Do nt have a Subaru yet  but I totally recognized that as Bridgewater . Creepy ...
  - Some of those roads are the shit . They need some new pavement but they are still good .
  - For sure . Bridgewater is my favorite place to go take random scenic drives 
- - well i love him  and i m putting all my faith into him still to show up soon .
  - Love can be a tricky thing . Sometimes the right thing to do is also the hardest thing to do . Sending you positive vibes  keep your head up .
- - Shooting your own team mate who is shooting at the enemy only helps the enemy .
  - A riflemen trying to snipe is a waste .
- - I think you re still thinking of a different show . The O.C . was a scripted show with actual actors and never hinted at being a reality show .
  - Ohhhhh  I know what you re talking about  I had forgotten all about that show . I know what you re talking about but I never watched it .
- - I thought bitcoins were anonymous and unhackable 
  - The protocol itself is pretty secure  but any service built on top of it can be hacked like any other service .
- - Right . That s why I cut the cord .
  - Great . It s still nothing new .
- - Street you grew up on and favorite pet . Oh wait  that s for porn star name .
  - I would be maple bacon . That is kind of fitting I guess .
- - Nope . Do you mean like  adding subtitles to Japanese AV 
  - yes . but i want to work for the company that does
- - Is that why they are called Comet Goldfish  because the come and go so quickly 
  - Because they wind up in the toilet shortly after purchase  just like Comet
- - I did nt see any mention of the race of the cops or suspect . Are you sure this is a genuine report 
  - I may be wrong but the article may have a mugshot of the suspect .
- - The Good Wife . I can only talk to my mom about it and she s like a season and a half behind anyway .
  - The title is such a turn off to an otherwise outstanding show .
- - So do nt buy it  what s the fucking problem 
  - Instead of giving the community an acceptable skin they give you a vanilla version . That s my point here .
- - making fun of dorks is different then making fun of black people
  - if i just strip all the context away and make a principled stand against a verb  surely nobody will notice my agenda
- - Blessed and happy New Year  Also on an unrelated note  do you support any London football teams 
  - I m not a big football fan but support Watford as my home team .
- - Alabama only lost because the SEC just ca nt get up for bowls that are nt the national championship game .

- - Somebody give that lady some milk eggs and steak .
  - Seriously . A twiggy  stick - figured Wonder Woman would be such a failure . Deadlifts and overhead presses  Gal ...
- - I m confused on what kind of agenda this supposedly furthered . I mean what was to gain here 
  - america saw armored vehicles and troops doing unwarranted searches by armed forces in the american city that started a revolution over such things ...
- - I was worried this would be another Mac and Me video phew
  - That s exactly why I came to the comments first .
- - There is no law against having your dick in your fanny pack
  - Yet there s people here that think he should ve somehow been arrested for something . Having a penis  I guess .
- - Exactly  One rule for some people  another entirely for others .
  - There is a huge biological difference between men and women . Most violent sex offenders are men . Maybe that s why we have different rules regarding nudity .
  - And male nudity ca nt arouse women 
  - you missed my point completely . men are more likely to act on it . women can get laid easily .
- - thanks . but now I m just confused as to how the qualifiers work  upper and lower bracket  does tinker have a chance to get into the game again 
  - yeah  it s double bracket elimination  Tinker can still qualify
- - I would imagine that most people who did nt enjoy the show did nt bother visiting the discussion threads .
  - Very true  that s what I thought was the main reason it did so poorly .
- - use auto mod to ban zero day accounts 
  - You can still see content though while banned  it only limits you from commenting . Commenting is nt the issue  seeing the content is .
- - I would kill to be able to watch GoT then sleep in
  - Just call in sick  nobody has to die tonight .
- - you should have watched more Star Trek  There are four lights .
  - You know number one at the end ... I did see five .

  - Yes she is OK . I just tell security that it is a small cat and she makes no problems and they let me in without x-raying her
- - You know you dun fucked up when you got your own Wikipedia article .
  - Or you dun did good  but in this case you dun fucked up ...
- - I keep looking behind her to the two about to kiss . I m easily distracted 
  - I did nt even see the freak out girl at first . lol . Nice shot btw .
- - is nt this an old article  I swear I ve read this exact opening before  or perhaps just another article about this particular fast food strike
  - I recognised some phrases  but I think it is a substantially and updated revised version of a previous piece
- - Please add me and tell me what my safari is 
  - Added you  Your type is Rock  with Nosepass and Magcargo so far 
- - Not in my experience but you can always reinstall if it does
  - awesome  the days of accidentally hitting a media button and playing some random wave file are over 
- - That dog has an airborne patch . That is so freaking cool .
  - They should put a little maroon beret on that adorable fucker
- - You re alright  OP . Sorry about your friends and wish you a great year ahead .
  - Appreciate it  and same to you 
- - The sound of it is kind of relaxing
  - If by relaxing you mean deafening  I agree .

  - Plus he never really stirred it . Its just soup taking a bath with him .
- - There are things that exist called laptops you know .
  - Lol that s what I was gon na say
- - Yeah that s what I found  I had a clitoral orgasm while having the toy in me and it was one of the most powerful orgasm I ve ever had 
  - Yeah  Even now just clitoral by myself  with my hand  feel soooo much better .
- - Mike Rowe  a millionaire celebrity who lives in a rich community and never interacts with the police knows about the issues and understands what ordinary people go through .
  - His insights were into how conservatives and liberals react to what happened .
- - Now it s a story  whereas before the arrest it really was nt .
  - Negative or positive impact  not so sure about that .
- - Same . I think HTC s is pretty  but still not as pretty or clean as stock .
  - I quite like BlinkFeed on my HTC  but I d prefer it to be an app and have mostly stock Android .
- - Jam . Them . At . The . Line .
  - With who  Narduzzi does nt bring in nickel corners to match slot personnel at the line .
- - So they can flashback the cards they discard  It may be worth it to read Necropotence again . It exiles each card you discard .
  - Yes I should have posted an edit cuz I realized that lol . But I m lazy xD
- - I ca nt wait for the butthurt to ensue .
  - It already is . Even in this thread there are people saying now its gon na be Anthony Johnson that will beat JJ . LOL .
- - What s common  Once a day  Several times a day 
  - A quick google search would suggest this is nt exactly a rare occurrence . It s not exactly a new phenomenon either .
- - Yeah  Amazon sells them for pretty good prices if you re interested .

  - I just got the email . I am so excited 
- - You got ta put some weight dude you seem crazy skinny
  - I am  how can i get fat  legit question
- - Nope . They must have looked at your browser history and found some red flags . NSA is on their way .
  - Whelp  it was only a matter of time until they caught up to me I guess .
- - A whole bunch of labour hating right wingers are going to flock to that place .
  - Why do they have to be right wingers  Why ca nt they be middle wingers  or top wingers  Why does everything have to become right vs left 
  - We should change it to cardinal directions . I like to see some north by northeast policy .
  - Gangs kind of have the market cornered on directions being used to refer to their groups .
- - Does that cat have tiny bananas on its feet 
  - I own a copy of this book  actually . Those are tiny mops so your cat can clean your floor as it walks around .
- - What s with the editorialized headline  I do nt see what is strange about the double jeopardy rules in question .
  - Yeah  I do nt quite understand what the strange part is either . Maybe I m just missing the point .
- - University of Houston for business . HELLO  ANYONE THERE 
  - I have a friend that might be going to Rice . Alas  he is a peasant .
- - Bought do nt touch me and two engrams  which both became do nt touch me .
  - Always decrypt before buying the item from Xur  always .
- - I think comic books movies are boring and childish so  yes  good original scripts are always better than adaptations of comic book heroes to me .
  - You thought the Dark Knight Trilogy was childish  You thought Watchmen was childish  You thought Future Past or Winter Soldier were boring  
- - jesus  i wish i could explain to my friends why this is so funny . none of them think so .
  - Every time I try to get a friend into MDE I lose a friend . It s worth it .
- - Where can I get one  My wife ca nt even make Hamburger Helper .
  - Where can you get a good Russian girl  Or Pierogies 
  - Ok  lets make a deal . You give me either the Russian girl or the potato dumplings  and I ll give you my wife .
  - Haha well that sounds good like a fair deal I ll teach her a thing or two
- - When was the last time Florida wore Orange Jerseys . God They are awful looking .
  - They are sexy . You re nuts .
- - Shootin some b-ball outside of the school 
  - When a couple of guys that were up to no good
- - Yeah I definitely think the guilt would outweigh any enjoyment
  - Unless you had a hankering for filet mignon in which case the double enjoyment would negate the guilt .

  - That s why I always check the stats after Harden has a good game .

  - Maybe he would love Gerrard to go anywhere but the MLS or Spain . Italy and France seem like exciting options . I think 
- - I hate to add to the negativity in these comments but the sides look quite easy for a baby to rollover also .
  - No way can it be a real baby bed . That kid is in a boppy pillow .
- - um  did you pay attention  Vice did nt compare it to meth  the news stories and what not IN the video compared it to meth .
  - But WHY even put that crap in the video  That s my point .
- - Shame  this is one of the best adventure comedy moves I have ever seen . Makes me grateful it was overlooked  no remake in the works .
  - It s a shame or it is a great thing that it was overlooked  Get it together  OP 
- - Wow  thanks a bunch . I ll have to give you your gold later  its really really late at night for me .
  - You re not going to give him gold  are you 
- - Remote play or being able to use a SmartGlass device as a second screen .
  - Came to say this  I m sure it s going to come eventually but this is the one feature that would be a game changer in my household .
- - He dodged a bullet  you re crazy as fuck . Tantrums  Dragging his family into it  Christ .
  - They honestly both sound like awful people  to me .
- - Is the battery still good  Try charging it  and checking the voltage . Maybe a bad cell or two 
  - I dont think the battery is the problem since the car does start
- - It ai nt that much  fuck hamplanets tho .
  - Its pretty easy to do but id be very full after that  this is probably just a snack for the ham .
- - I wo nt be able to stop myself from killing all the red pointers ...
  - Haha yeah it s hard ... You just have to remember that if you kill someone  they can choose to kick you from the server  so that helps .
- - And this entire time I ve been thinking Charlie Hebdo was a person
  - TIL as well . I thought it was the head cartoonist or something .
- - The arc is way bigger than I imagined .
  - Try standing underneath it at the eternal flame for Charles de Gaulle . It is amazing . The Eiffel Tower is amazing . Paris is amazing .
- - Does nt tell me why there s such a giant ass queue for a small server with not a ton of people playing
  - You have nt even said what server you re on . It could be crashing .
- - Does anybody else dread getting dressed up for something sometimes because you do nt think you will be comfortable but then you do and you are actually pretty comfortable 
  - Yeah  people always say that formal wear is restrictive and uncomfortable but I just think their clothes are too small .
- - With that in mind  what would you like to do  kill all Muslims 
  - No just stop apologizing for them and supporting them .
- - That s what that shit is about  I thought it was a kid s movie .
  - Yeah  like the preteen version of Harold and Kumar .
- - How perfect would it be if Aguayo missed a game winner to lose 
  - You mean Wide Right  I can get behind this
- - The Empire is economically socialist . I speak from experience . You are young  but the rest of us remember ...
  - Are you making an argument that because you have an older nation you are better than us  Wow .
  - No  I m saying that you re treading on some history right here  and potentially stirring up old currents .
  - I do nt want you to become an enemy of mine  so I think we ll leave it at that .
- - Does she have a second name  For research purposes 
  - She s on Hegre art . That s all I got .
- - By that logic Liverpool is a shit club which is far from true .
  - Liverpool were making runs into the semi final and champions league final whilst PSG were finishing mid table  so no  that s not very true at all .
- - you still have to pay the console makers and the publisher on top of that along with the retail stores .
  - Yeah  absolutely . But that s why I said gross and not net .
- - TL ; DR Live in a cauldron and masturbate in public
  - and pee on people  and poop in the theater .

  - Oh man . This particular scar is gon na look like shit .
  - What makes you say that  Seems like a pretty straightforward process .
- - why are you supposed to learn boxing from someone who never boxed  Next up . basement small circle fighting from Brad Pitt .
  - I think he did box for a little bit
- - I think you re just rambling random shit at this point .
  - Which part of that was too hard for you to understand  If you let me know I can spell it out in simpler language .
- - Why did you click on the ability in the witch doctor kill  Any reason  Or was it just for style points 
  - He did nt click on it  just hovered over it to see the range .
- - the WASD Code is a good keyboard but only comes in MX Greens and Clears  keep that in mind .
  - A keyboard that only comes in esoteric flavors   It s my lucky day .
- - If thorium reactors become a thing  all the waste can be used as fuel .
  - Yes  with a meltdown basically impossible due to the design . We probably could have been much further along with this technology if nuclear paranoia never got so far .
- - You people are so fucking retarded with your dumb shuffle guessing . Go jump of bridge .
  - I m just guessing whats ur problem  Besides  EE never streams with anyone else .
- - Not always many collectors editions are limited and go out of stock very quickly . The destiny ghost edition was gone in no time .
  - And look what happened  the game was a massive disappointment but Bungie had everyone s money already .
- - Hope you catch the guy  but why are your dogs outside alone and not secured by some means 
  - Not my dogs but his front porch area is gated . And when the package was delivered the man took his dogs from his property and put them in his truck .
- - The ball is still in his hand too though so Im not sure what to think .
  - yeah its hard to tell with the first one  but I think he threw it . But the second one is so obvious
- - I m willing to pay for this if i m able to chromecast without lag
  - Same here . My Chromecast lags occasionally as it is with the lower quality streams . Still not sure exactly what the cause is .
- - At the game  what did I do to deserve this 
  - At least you got a free T-shirt .
- - any chance jovetic gets one  a goal and an assist  or I guess after tomorrows attackers play we will know more .
  - Oh man that s be an amazing card . He s so well rounded
- - It s logical for people to be annoyed at the disproportionate power of nomads . And do you seriously think the Jews would have happily left Germany 
  - Children of Israel would have joined army if allowed  marched wherever told . Of course .
- - Hm yeah I do nt have a me  tab . Also all the names for the type of exercise appear to be in German which is strange
  - That is messed . Hmm . Maybe try a different app haha . P
- - The new BA non-stop between Austin and London is fantastic  europe is so much easier to get to now from here 
  - I m in DFW but have had several friends book their European trips from Austin  as it tends to be cheaper .

  - Now  that would be an hilarious twitter comeback from Hellraisers PR guys .
- - Both are maritime nations and Singapore is a hub for shipping and technology in Asia . Anyway if he needs more info you or him feel free to pm me
  - Oh thanks a lot  I ll let him know .

- - It s like it s a national holiday or something 
  - I m still drunk . I understand .
- - actually  you got to give it to herb . pretty good chin . took dc s best shot flush and was nt even staggered .
  - Herb is the only ref that actually has a few fights under his belt . It d take a few more to wobble him .
- - So as kids were we just told they saw black and white because it s easier to understand 
  - No probably because our parents did nt know .
- - There s a big  big difference between what people say and what they actually think  especially about controversial questions .
  - Attacking a scientific survey is not that simple . Pew did a fantastic job and I think the results really represent something which is very close to reality .
- - I would finally be able to use an exotic primary in the nightfall .
  - Go get yourself a vex for those weeks that have solar burn
- - You ca nt buy DLC exotics from xur if you do nt have the DLC  but they can drop from engrams and as rewards
  - Ahh  okay . Thabks for clearing that up
- - Could it be in Chicago  There s mention of it several times in new vegas
  - I think Chicago would be left for Obsidian should they get chance to make it again  I m looking forward to that locale too .
- - He means when hovered over  to show they can be pressed .
  - Yeah  thanks  It was kinda confusing because I could nt tell if I could press them .
- - I dont think you can grant viceroyalties of Empires .
  - You ca nt have vassal emperors  period . I suppose he could grant all the relevant kingdoms to a vassal  though .
- - I just discovered and consequently devoured Black Mirror . I want more also  so I m posting to follow .
  - I think the most disturbing one was the one with the prime minister .
- - When he and Reggie collide  shit will get real .
  - God they need to make a reality show about the Thunders locker room now .
