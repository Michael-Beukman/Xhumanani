- - This image has been floating around tumblr and pinterest for weeks . It s a cell phone snap of a kid wearing baby designer clothes with an instagram filter .
  - Link because it is most definitely my friend
- - Looks like you have an extra gjallarhorn to give me .
  - if only there was trading  i d give one away .
- - My first united jersey was with his name
  - His signed jersey is still on my living room wall . Legend .
- - You might want to try taking the plastic off and cooking before you make a comparison  buddy .
  - I had the same thought at first but I think OP was comparing the amount of pepperoni in the picture .

  - Agents was cancelled  I am not finding any news of that anywhere .
- - The moles or zits on your face grab my attention . You are attractive though .

  - I hope so  I have to work tomorrow . I do nt want to have to stay up til midnight  sorry .
- - Guns  Germs  and Steel so they can figure out if they re ultimately the ones who will do the fucking or the ones being fucked .
  - i remember that book from a class i had to take
- - So  since I ca nt see atoms  or other galaxies  they do nt exist 
  - Except we can see and confirm that those exist . See how that works  It s self evident .
- - I d rather be able to buy titles and not have to worry about getting enough bang for my buck in any given month .
  - Well you still can . I do nt see what the problem is .
- - OP s ex may not have been a male .
  - That was wrong for me to assume  and I m sorry .

  - That s a compliment I have nt heard yet  and thanks .
- - Helping people run raids today  is your gf single 
  - You know I m still at work  so I may have to get back to you on that .

  - We ll never know . I heard there s no known survivors .

- - It does nt matter who has what season . Anyone should be able to connect to each other .
  - Hmm I see ... That s what I thought . I ll try again tonight thank you 
- - But capping does usually not win games  doing damage is what wins games .
  - I will do what it takes to win  even if it is unpopular .
- - Both of these teams are like the same shade of red . I m confused 
  - Oh man  do nt call Bama s color red  in front of them . They take it pretty hard . It s like kicking their puppy or something .
- - Pretty sure that these were all price mistakes .
  - Apparently some guy got this same deal last year in SD .
- - Use prisoners  US has a massive free labour force  and they re just wasting it
  - I ll let you trust your livelihood to a prisoner being forced into labor . I ll figure something else out . Thanks .
- - Fire the shithead anesthesiologist . Brain feels no pain  but goddamn .

- - Holy crap  I have family in Alberta  I m in Montana . Did you guys get hit with this storm too 
  - Sure did but to a lesser extent  we usually get the lighter side of things being in Calgary but it is still frigid out there .
- - How do you wait that long to call an offsides  Seems like they were trying to bail FSU out a bit .
  - I thought he lined up offsides three in a row . Someone on sidelines needs to tell him in that situation
- - I d be pissed if I got cum on my suit
  - Pussy juice also leaves a pretty nasty stain .
- - Ca nt tell you much without a pic . What about the color 
  - They are light blue  which is normal  but speckled . And the numbers look really faded . Kinda like they wore down or somethin .
  - I think they are the new formula . There have been a few threads on this . I think they are good .
  - I think speckled means they re fake from all I ve read
- - What if you preordered poker night  I preordered both and I think it would be cool if they where just genuine achievement items

- - did the Monstars take over the rangers 
  - Someone submit this for best of the week . I m on my phone .
- - Make sure the place smells good  Burn some incense
  - Incense is for dirty hippies . Get a candle  OP .
  - He could bake a pie beforehand like people who sells homes do .
  - They sell sprays and candles that achieve the same effect  but yeah .
- - Did the tempo force all of those turnovers 
  - It made that defense look like Swiss cheese .
  - Their d has been marginal all season . How did the tempo affect FSU s offense 
  - It put them in a big hole . It did nt affect the turnovers .
- - how is that a weird question  you bought food from them  I think it s pretty natural for them to ask if you re enjoying it .
  - I am fairly confident that if the food is shitty the waiter will hear about it .
- - Is it good to read the news or not 
  - Depends on the news source . I always find that sources like CNN or Yahoo  News are always interesting and keep me up-to-date on important stuff .
- - Boxing to Muhammad Ali is what Parkinson s is to Muhammad Ali .
  - All I know is its hard to sign your credit card slips with either of them .
- - I think it s better than West Virginia but worse than Wisconsin

- - Damn . You and I have had very similar experiences . I switched from engineering to anth after about a month of college .

- - Makes sense . Do you wear watches at all or is that really the only thing you wear on your wrist 
  - Right now not even wearing the watch .
- - Link is dead  what is it 
  - Too Faced Absolutely Flawless concealer . It is heavenly .
- - Guess Patty wasnt a fan of Petes old system .
  - Yeah  he totally threw him under the bus  and it was AWESOME .

  - Do nt tease him . He ca nt even read your question ...
- - Too bad Cole shat all over Finkel . Horrible .

  - Yeah  kinda looked like a Maverick defending out there .
- - Funny  the Patrick Swayze I know made a movie where he kicked people a lot .
  - The Patrick Swayze you used  to know . Sadly Patrick Swayze s roundhouse kicks are no longer avaliable . . s
- - Wow  interesting . I think there s a sad metaphor in there somewhere . Did you use it on other pillows 
  - Nah  it became more of a Linus blanket type of thing .
- - If your hand is bigger than your face  you have cancer . I am not falling for that one again 
  - Just checked it  nearly smacked myself when i realized what i am doing .
- - Laugh away  but its true . Austin Davis and Shaun Hill are in the NFL . Bryce Ramsey is not .
  - And now he s working against even worse defenses 
- - The ISSUE only exists because someone in the media got a hold of it . Has Canadian media become CNN  Fuck I hope not . Bring on the fear-mongering 
  - That logic is insane . Then the issue of ANYTHING wrong only exists because someone found out . So if things are kept under wraps its fine 
- - I am loving the Lions fans complaining about the officiating .
  - as if almost the entire game  the officiating WASNT going for the lions .

  - But Jason Statham will stay alive  even though at first  you think he s dead .
- - I think people forget how huge Chevy Chase was back in the day .
  - I know  he absolutely towers over Paul Simon .
- - Isolated . There was literally tens of thousands of officers there today from hundreds of agencies . It was uniforms as far as the eye could see .
  - Not trolling but I was curious . Do cops get paid or mandated to attend these or do most attend out of respect and for free 
- - In some areas having a shed over the property line for a certain matter of time could let your neighbor seize that land
  - On the property line is not the same as over the line though .

- - and what do you want it to look like  Have you installed any themes or custom lockscreen apps to modify it 
  - Sorry for the lack of precision  I meant going back to the lockscreen with the blue box  I surprisingly prefer it that way .
  - The blue box was replaced by this in an update .
  - I just saw that indeed  any not so complicated way to get it back 
- - I do nt see a single Canadian themed channel on that list .
  - Sorry  I misread your post . I assumed it was asking for available channels in Canada .
- - Meanwhile  NASA is the only space agency without the name of their country in the title .
  - Well  ESA has no country name in the title .
- - My favorite part is when the cum shoots all over her face .
  - I prefer the part before that  but everybody has their own preferences so that s okay .
- - That s what I m getting at . Its OBJ clearly now  but people were really trying to force ODB a month ago .
  - I saw that as well  and I did nt understand why it would be ODB . Made no sense  so I m glad OBJ is being used now .
  - ODB is a reference to Ol  Dirty Bastard from Wu Tang Clan  which is why a lot of us like it  and why Beckham definitely does nt .
  - He does nt like it  What is he  a sissy or sumthin

  - the mosque has been demolished  but the temple is not built yet . Far-right Hindu groups are campaigning for this
- - I would love to hear this story . Sounds good .
  - I do nt have the time right now  but I should be able to tell it sometime tonight
- - Come on ladies  hook this guy up . It s his last day on Earth .
  - Ive got a lovely gf and live by the TX coast . Just wanted to know if gals appreciate trucks .
- - Yeah I ve always dreamed of visiting California . One of these days I will 
  - I like to think OP s conception of California begins and ends with this museum .
- - I think the Rock was best at throwing punches that really played to the crowd
  - His exchanges with Austin were always the best . I still mark out when I think about them trading shots .

  - You just have to say it directly to his face and make clearly defined lip movements .
- - My rule is anyone except for New England  Pittsburgh  Dallas  Seattle . I am fine with anyone outside of that .

  - thanks for the suggestion . I have discovered that the bottom third of the screen will not respond to any clicks  so I will continue to explore the issue .
- - Well then let s address this parallel . What is the atheistic hypothesis on the Origin of Life 
  - There is none ... Atheism does nt have a set of beliefs  creeds or dogmas . Atheists likely have a large variety of beliefs on this subject .
- - I take a shower every other day instead of every day . I have really thick long hair so it s a pain to shampoo and conditioner it so frequently .
  - you can still shower without washing your hair you know
- - Lions  you have a Georgia Bulldog Quarterback and a Georgia Tech Megatron . Practically makes you family .
  - And the Detroit Pistons had to suffer having Josh Smith play for them . We felt empathy every time Smith took a contested three or long two .
- - That mother fucker did nt drink the water
  - Ah he got a little drip on his lip . Good enough right 
- - Fully upgraded Trolly Problem or Murmur should do the trick for you . As for Thorn bounty ... idk  I deleted that shiz .
  - Murmur  Not SGA for completing this bounty .
- - Wouldnt the effects of a penance stare affect one of the souls has devoured 
  - That one I m not sure about . I guess it would depend on how sentient they are when they re being controlled by Alucard .
- - You should start a youtube to promote your art a bit more
  - I have a youtube but I have nt really done much speed arts or stuff there but I will start

  - That s how I feel every time I look at it too . I do nt know why I torture myself
- - I think you re suppose to think its Santa . Calling it one of his elves is a spoiler iirc
  - Woops . Sorry  will correct that .
- - He has a point  but I m glad he admitted he was exaggerating .
  - What the f was he trying to say  It sounded like ramble .
- - Whatever your judgement of the report saying that the figures about loss of jobs are all paid for and manufactured and that these miners deserve no sympathy is just blind rage .
  - LOL . What agenda is it that you have  Why cant you see this report for what it is  Its paid reporting .
- - Meh  they re not actually making the sounds with the peaches  just using then as conductive terminals . Really no different than using a sample pad .
  - This is exactly what I was thinking . It s basically a synth  and the peaches are just keys .
- - Glad I only got todays bounties left to do .
  - I ll probably just leave them . Got so many strange coins  was only wanting the rep for my alts .
- - Russel Arnold is one of my favourite guest commentators
  - I was just about to say this . I have seen a few people who do nt seem to like him but I have thoroughly enjoyed his commentary this whole series .
  - One of my favourite moments in the series was when McMillan did a short stint in the box  called Styris Pig  then tried to cover it up .
  - Must have missed that . Is nt Styris  nickname Pig  Remember the old Pig vs Rig stuff on the Cricket Show

- - Yeah  I was supposed to deposit it earlier but then it cancelled  so I had to delete my message as well . Also  thank you 
  - Ahh I see  and no problem . D
- - Would you sell your USD just because a bank got robbed 
  - I dont think bitcoin and USD are comparable assets . Also banks have the amounts insured in case they are hacked and as a result would go bankrupt .
- - The players kept playing so clearly they knew the first shot was nt in . Perfectly fine goal
  - No  the players relaxed as well . It was pretty much a throw away shot that just so happened to be counted .
  - Pittsburgh kept playing so maybe we should be as alert as them
  - Nah  just that one guy did .
- - Yeah but who cares  The tradition sucked  so we made a new tradition .
  - The Rose Bowl tradition sucked  What planet do you live on

  - well there s always a silver lining .
- - This game is just what stanley does before the stanley parable .
  - Stanley does not die  but is transported to a different dimension
- - They all look sort of wierd . I almost did nt recognise them .
  - When they re all around each other  their power fades
- - Golden son had me shattered . I m calling it now  best book of the year .
  - I ll second that . It blew away Red Rising and Red Rising was one of my favorite reads last year .
- - This is the third time this has been posted here .
  - It also has literally no relation to RWBY other than that it uses some similar words .
- - How much fucking time did they just spend talking about how to engage refs  Who the fuck cares  Talking about baseball for a while there too .
  - They also informed us how long the intermission would be .
- - If I were to just call her up and ask her out it would be so out of the blue though ...
  - It might makes it more memorable and impressive for X though  if you did . Raptor points .
