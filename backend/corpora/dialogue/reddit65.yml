- - Well the two UAs in this review are off
  - Well obvs  bc these are from a rep site .

  - That s how I took it  though the picture does nt really follow  and apparently the commercial is worse .
- - I have nothing against abortion either but . WHAT IN THE HOLY HOT DOG FUCK
  - Pretty much my reaction  to this day a part of me hopes she was just trolling .
- - Hahaha I ve had so many discussions about this question  but I ve never heard that reasoning before . Nice 
  - seriously  what are the most common reasons 
- - Question  does this also happen to moose ... mooses ... meese 
  - Moose and yes . Every animal with antlers do it . Not horns  antlers . A lot of people get those mixed up .
  - Interesting . That s a little fun fact
  - It is . Freakin  nature  man .
- - That looks so much better . The bigger mouse space is much more appropriate imo .
  - Agreed  but some people like to have very high sensitivity on there mouses which does mean you move your mouse a lot less
- - So can any political speech . The distinction of satire is that it s more entertaining to read  not that it s more extreme .
  - Well yeah  I guess I mean speech in general . I told you I d mess it up .
- - Not a Husky ... either a Klee Kai or a Malamute or both .
  - Not a Finn ... either a Swede or a Dane or both .
- - Is there a cost for this  I am guessing there is .
  - Yes  there is but that will be discussed across email

- - What happens to cargo if I store a ship filled with cargo in a station and leave in another ship 
  - You cant do that at the moment .

  - I thought this was Chappelle when I first saw it .

  - Once again  I could nt agree more . It s been long overdue for Vince to hand over the car keys .
- - where are these artworks from  they re very well drawn
  - A few of the Dragon ones from the Time Walker class come from MTG .
- - With the great fire rate and double HS kill close range  damage is definitely not a problem .
  - Its still not as good as it was before so there s no need to panic yet . Give it time and see how it goes before claiming OP .
- - Great advice . I definitely second volunteering  you really meet a lot of amazing people .

- - Did you listen to the Riddles in the Dark podcast  They hit upon that same point .
  - Never even heard of it . What did they conclude 
- - Lol  no voice acting  Is reading too hard 
  - When the writing is nt good and there is ALOT of it  yes . It kills the enjoyment of the game .
  - So you d rather have a voice actor who most likely is nt good read the writing that is nt good for you 
  - I d rather not have to deal with bad writing at all  but if I have to voice acting is preferable
- - Heavy women seem to be more stigmatized though .
  - Is it the stigma that comes first or is it the reaction that causes it 
- - Could the colour commentator be any more biased  Done nothing but whine about Arsenal s defending .

- - Can confirm . My dog seems to enjoy it more .
  - I m not even sure where to begin with my questions ...
- - Why do nt you actually read what they write and find out 
  - Their reasons are really badly substantiated and usually involve projection or deflection of the question .
  - Is there a specific example or two you re writing this in response to 
  - First thing that comes to mind is over their meltdown over that astronomer that wore a shirt with sexy ladies on it .
- - Really  What was I down voted for

- - Too fickle . I d get a tattoo and hate it by the next week .
  - Me too ... maybe not hate but I tend to change my mind a lot .
- - As someone who knows both Ottawa and Victoria quite well  I would agree on all counts  except that Ottawa feels bigger and much more sprawling than Greater Victoria .
  - I like to compare Victoria to a cross between Ottawa and Kingston .
- - I wonder why I only one has a fixed bayonet
  - Or maybe there is only one without  because of the grenade launcher .

- - Mac truck right  One of the Rangers fb pages posted the exact same question earlier
  - Yup . Seems like he s been playing longer  right 
- - Come on refs keep the whistles down .
  - I think they had a stretch of a couple lame calls  but all in all theyve been letting em play IMO .
- - Uh  no disrespect  but yeah you re wrong . It s pretty hideous .
  - While I disagree with your opinion at least you were more polite about it .
- - If you do nt mind used games there are probably people willing to trade great titles for them
  - Thanks for the advice - I ll look around . Definitely do nt mind used .

  - I AM NOT BOB MILLER  BUT I AM HIS PILLOW . HE TALKS IN HIS SLEEP ABOUT NIETO  CROSBY  AND ST. LOUIS
- - I thought Michigan legalized it awhile ago  Was it overturned 
  - State banned it  federal district court overturned the ban  appeals court overturned that decision . Will probably go to Supreme Court .
- - I m honestly surprised it took this long
  - He was injured for some time . You ca nt send an injured player to the minors
- - Man what the fuck was I looking at then O.o
  - They are cheap because they do nt have as many features . They also require software on a computer to be constantly running .
- - can we get some of that lemon poundcake tho

- - Well it looks I m never gon na enjoy the taste of absinthe
  - Though to be fair  Jger is nt the best representation of the flavor .
- - Helena Bonham Carter . Not stunning  but intriguing .
  - I do nt know what it is about her but I absolutely agree .
- - True . Lewis did nt knock Tyson out . He just punched him until Tyson could nt stand anymore .
  - That s why it s such a sad fight to watch  Lewis tortured him until he quit . It s brutal .
- - Not sure why but the thumbnail on mobile kinda looked like a screen shot from a sims game lol .
  - I m glad I m not the only one who was thinking that .
- - And it got Flavio  for a period  to shut the hell up .

- - Would it upset you if I pissed all over a statue of Jesus in a church  Religious icons have meaning ...
  - No that actually would nt to be honest
- - Slightly in favor as in more likely for ACL injuries to be caused  or more likely to be prevented  Turf is not an area of expertise for me .
  - in favor of using natural turf . But only slightly  it cant be a keystone argument . The biggest thing with turf is temperature regulation and impact absorption
  - Them things do get hot as shit in the summer .
  - Yea like I said  it has a decent amount of benefits but you ca nt really argue in favor of it if the funds are nt there .
- - This is why I think teams are so comfortable taking tackles in the draft early . Even if they do nt pan out they can find success as a guard .
  - Beats drafting Warmack or Cooper and wondering what to do when they do nt look all that good . Im so disappointed neither of them have been tearing it up yet .
- - Where I m at now i ca nt get a solid connection with my DS  but I ll let you know when I can get connected .
  - Ok . I ll be on  most likely .
- - Bad jokes are for friends  not for posting on an online service that people scour to get offended about something .
  - That is the best description of twitter I ve read  Well done .
- - I m going to paint my walls red if they blow this
  - Saved . You re in deep now .
- - It flies like a steakhouse but handles like a bistro .
  - I m going to fly her brains out .
- - What if I can see this all the time looking at anything and it s like the entire surface s moving like that instead of whats happening in the picture 
  - Check out Visual Snow Syndrome . Might be what you re experiencing .
- - There s nothing NSFW about this . Come on .
  - I agree  Its getting tiresome how many post are this way
- - That comment was just my own approach in my opinion to lets plays . Did nt say everyone had to share the same view as me .
  - You pretty much did with your first sentence .
