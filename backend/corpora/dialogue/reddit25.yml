  - Oh god these people  And people who feel like they have to constantly fill the silence  so they end up saying anything . Just shut up

  - Refs . Although the camera angles are nt great

  - No idea . It s a compromise  I want both
- - I saw this scene a little bit ago between two of our cats . shortly after  growling  hissing  biting and flying fur .
  - These two play quite a bit but never hiss or growl at each other .
- - Do nt be so sure . We re in the era where broadcasting a question is more interesting than researching it .
  - I tweeted to see if this was true and it was confirmed  so now I hold it as a fact .
- - Cesaro kept big e up for a long time . That s some strength .
  - We already knew he was a freak of nature though .

  - It also does nt explain what s happening here .

- - May I ask you why you feel that way 
  - He s a serial troll  do nt waste the time ...
- - It s expensive and shitty and yet  way better than that .
  - For now  yes . For the next few years  probably . But given enough time and enough of a financial incentive  I doubt it .
- - Do we really need to ask for a link 
  - It was supposed to be a parody of clickbait titles .
- - Vipers are nt large ships ... I would say more anything above a cobra  with cobras themselves being iffy .
  - I wan na think he maybe meant Python not viper .
- - Wells I m black and did nt have prior swim lessons like all the other cool kids . WSQ took me a couple tries  but I still made it .
  - Wait ... You re black and you not only passed a swim qual  you knocked out a WSQ     What are you  a unicorn

  - This is also my technique . For masturbation .
- - Everything in this reply is exactly what I posted before when others have nt asked this question .
  - It s something that may not be obvious  but most people are not as paranoid so you notice it in contrast to them .
- - I did some I could nt find an answer others like I said had mixed answers
  - That s because most of the information we have about kratom is anecdotal and kratom is very subjective .
- - How is this not the biggest news of the day  This means that so many people including Lampard have been complicit for so long .
  - Because nobody outside of the MLS is surprised  or cares
- - Sorry  I m not getting the syntax ...
  - Probably cause we are in the matrix .
- - Thank you for your insight today . Parlayed both your picks . First time watching aussie basketball and was pretty surprised to see flopping being called .

- - What state is this in  I m going guess Mississippi but Texas is also a good one
  - Could be Pennsylvania or West Virginia too .
- - And unless i read the map wrongly . i think you were shitting when you posted this
  - Haha . Nope . It just means that I m at place where I ve shat at before .
- - I bet you re naked under all those clothes ... hussy

  - If by surprisingly  extremely satisfying you also mean a wee bit terrifying as well .
- - Goats are more practical survival animals in my opinion .
  - I ve only had cows  what are the pros of goats 
- - So cute  What auction is this  Do a lot of rescues have this type of auction 
  - I have no clue honestly . My mom just asks me to make them and i do . Shes part of so many westie rescues .
- - Yeah  and the OT says you can stone people and fuck goats
  - I never claimed it did nt . Pretty hilarious  though .
- - All it takes is one amazing trip to get back over the anxiety and fear of the bad trips
  - Indeed  it s amazing . So thankful I can finally experience it again
- - Penguin meme ... You caused the awkward situation
  - Well it would nt have been awkward if the woman had just politely allowed him to steal the car 
- - Well  damn  spot on  But NK are nut jobs so Randall picking a nut jobby headline seems like shooting fish in a barrel .
  - If only North Korea had fish and barrels to put said fish in .
- - The prosecution would nt want to risk turning up anything that might contradict their star witness  as the defense would then have access to it .
  - You mean anything else  since their star witness flat-out contradicted himself just fine .

- - That sauce looks like some kind of Jam or Pie filling .
  - I believe it s some kind of strawberry sauce .
- - Jurassic park do nt take chances on technology and do nt try to befriend velociraptors
  - you do nt really befriend something you re gon na eat  IMO
- - I thought the ending felt abit contrived although overall really enjoyed it . Also appeared to have alot of wes anderson influence especially with the transition between days .
  - I felt it could have ended perfectly with him carrying her through the fog . The little addendum with the bus was unnecessary .
- - he was asking about the horse you need to craft the carriage .
  - i apologize  did nt realize it was a separate horse
- - Two shots  wide open from the slot . It s going to go in eventually . We ca nt allow those shots to be taken anymore .
  - Looks a lot like Allen s shots he had to defend against ...
- - haha  i cant believe thats real 
  - I know  I  too  have a hard time believing there s porn on the Internet .
- - As prolific as Molinari was  and as much ground as his work appears to have covered  I would nt be surprised if neither label really did him justice .
  - Do you think it s safe to say that Molinari was writing in the tradition of classical liberalism 
- - Imo trying to make you own skin from scratch is always the best IF you want to release something
  - Yeah I have experience I m just lazy ; P Will make a better version though ...

  - I do nt really know  I just wrote what would make sense to me .
- - he has nt ever fouled out of a game
  - because thibs pulls him immediately after every foul  thus his low minutes consistently .
- - How long until anxiety went away  Im still dealing w it
  - I think a lot of it depends on if you have existing anxiety . I m medicated for my anxiety and mine is definitely still there just mellowed a bit .

  - I think you posted this on the wrong thread  . p
  - hahah ... that s first . multitasking . bad . thanks .
  - I was confused about what song you were referring to until I saw that other thread lol
- - Luck looks like a gazelle every time he takes off for a run
  - A rhino dressed as a gazelle . He does nt cut well  but runs great straight
- - To people who wanted the Kurt Warner comeback . This d-line is why it did nt happen . Any d-line is why it did nt happen .
  - Pair that with our O-Line and it s a recipe for a wheelchair .
- - May be getting a little late for that unfortunately .
  - A villain obsessed with youth and age may be entirely appropriate for the original creative team returning .
- - Player cap meaning being able to have more summons 
  - Yep . Up to six players now i think haha .
- - soooo ... where s the link to the petition  let s make our voices heard 
  - If you re in WA go to local government websites find the phone numbers or emails and push for change .

  - But ... I ... You ... I got nothing . Jerk .
- - Overeem also has solid history of losing his marbles for just long enough to eat a howitzer .
  - Usually it s against bigger guys that he is nt as comfortable moving forward on .
- - I honestly think Duck Hunt should be a PetCo exclusive ...
  - Naw he s clearly a target exclusive .
- - Did you ever consider he simply might not remember when and with whom he played it before 
  - In combination with the fact Arin consistently avoids mentioning Jon  it s more likely evasion rather than a poor memory .
- - May with an Aqua Grunt should be a thing too
  - May with a female aqua grunt or a male aqua grunt  This is nt important at all  I m just curious .
- - They were nt playing video games when the original Wolfenstein came out . They were still calling gamers losers because gaming was nt fashionable yet .
  - To be fair  they re still not playing video games .
- - it was already like that  so it does nt work  but thanks
  - Hm ... Your before and after pictures are the same btw .
- - Reading that on a phone was a nightmare .

  - Maybe it want to be put out of its misery .
- - If anyone is able to buy a few extra and send one to Vancouver Canada please let me know 
  - In Vancouver as well  I can chip in .
- - It still bugs me that somehow it came into the popular vernacular that Macs are nt PCs . It bugged me before the damned commercials  and it bugs me now .
  - Yeah  it s completely ridiculous but I had to make some kind of distinction .
- - The lift hill has really been a problem for TC  while WC just got a completely new one .
  - What problems  They said the fire actually helped them because the wood had to come done anyways .
- - Chickens will not lay eggs underground . I tested for four days and did nt get a single one . Give them sunlight .
  - Now that is a pain . Luckily I did nt start building the cock cooker just yet .
- - Pretty good although the original is a tough one to top .
  - Oh pretty impossible to top . But I think Ms Mr does nt a pretty cool version .
- - Bullshit . I have no sympathy for drunk drivers but seriously you re going to ban them from buying a legal substance because they may commit a crime later 
  - It s not much different from taking a released criminal s right to firearms .
- - I would also be interested in this but on the frugal as conceivable side of the spectrum .
  - I like the target ones . Got a couple for two bucks and they are nt bad .
- - Good health . People take it for granted .
  - Totally agree . Respect your body  it can only take so many excess calories before it breaks .
- - Wow  that s not even a small margin .
  - reflected in the price difference . P I got a mid range card didnt aim for the high end .
- - Wait wait URSULA bride of the Merling King  Dudes this is a jest ... uts referencing the Little Mermaid i think  Lol
  - We ve had Elmo  Grover and Kermit Tully  I think George ran out of names .
- - Your sadness is manipulation of others . Fight it  do nt be selfish .
  - In what way does it manipulate others if I clearly do nt want anyone else to find out 
- - You re assuming that all of them will be fully evolved which is not a safe assumption .
  - I think you ll find I even admitted this was speculation  there has nt even been a confirmation of their abilities
- - Neither . A single  continuous dungeon . Like God of War .
  - So you want a linear Zelda game  I think you re pretty alone with that one .
- - Nice  How does it feel  I find their sweaters can be pretty scratchy .
  - It s really nice  no issue here . I have a lot of cardigans from there too and they re also very comfortable .
- - A pen from work  fine . The whole desk  That s frowned upon .
  - If anyone would manage to sneak out the whole desk  I d give that man the desk .
- - Someone hand me a tissue . My nose may or may not be bleeding .
  - Its okay I got you . No more blood .
- - It would be interesting to see if this was his blackmail check being cashed . Was he about to blow the whistle on something 
  - I wonder the same about Prince Andrew .
- - It s amazing how we have the exact same aspirations  I m going to choose industrial engineering too . I m a junior in highschool right now though
  - Nice  good luck bud and see you at Apple HQ 
- - Yes I fucking hope so . Hopefully he adresses this issue and it gets posted as a youtube link on the front page or something .

- - Did Cabaye not want out of Newcastle  Why would he go back 
  - Might have realised the grass is nt always greener
- - Lenin is a communist hero . Ayn Rand is a Objectivist hero . I do nt agree with either . It s not a term of endearment .
  - I suppose  although that use of the word hero  is always going to confuse people
- - lol  guns are not anything vaguely close to neutral . But that is another subject . I agree with the point you re making .
  - Are ... are you under the impression that guns are capable of firing themselves and developing motives to do so 
- - They usually only target military targets  the reason why they are not on the EU terror list .
  - They surround their own military targets with civilians  while targeting civilians with their attacks  so I m not sure if we re talking about the same Hezbollah
- - I stopped listening to that as soon as the music started
  - And nobody blames you for that . It a sane and normal response to thee negative stimulus .
- - Wait  so they actually had those ads on their site  Thought that shit was shooped .
  - Those are actual ads . For a real shitty MMO .
- - Not the worst way to spend it ... What are your plans for this host 
  - Just to test stuff ; basically PHP  MySQL  and Python sandboxing .
- - Wo nt happen . The advances in red-blue technology mean we do nt have to visually identify anymore .
  - Tell that to the Canadian soldiers killed by an US jets in Afghanistan .
- - I love Chomsky as much as the next person  but do we need to post this same clip every other day 
  - Yes . I must have my Chomsky addiction satisfied .

  - Nah  he ll be fine . They got him a Coke Zero  too .
- - I feel really tempted to try and make a fruit loop crust . I can use it to serve milk in .
  - One serving of inside-out cereal  please .
- - Azir and Gnar unless they get nerfed  their kits are made for competitive .
  - I think they re gon na get nerfed a lot and still get used like Lucian last season .
  - Azir  skit seems kinda hard to balance
  - Well his early game w damage is ridiculous so that s a start .
- - Kool aid  crushed ice  and salt .
  - This for sure  I like lemon koolaid packets with crushed ice and a dash of salt . Mmm
- - How has this kid not died yet  
  - Perhaps he s ensured he s got dry palms .
- - My girlfriend thought I was weird for being excited to use our new expensive vacuum cleaner . I d be ecstatic about a new washer and dryer .
  - OMG a good vacuum is a life-changing thing  Has she never had a shitty one to compare it to 
- - The human interest would be surrounding the engineer and the people working on the cars .
  - really  Do you remember the engineers that built the moon lander or the guy that walked on the moon 
  - The point is that there would nt be any pilot . It would be like Matt Taylor and the asteroid landing . People were talking about the scientist .
  - the only reason people might know his name is the shirt incident
- - Congratulations on being offended . Say a prayer for us when you have your ass in the air next time . Mkay 
  - Sure will I ll pray that bigoted ignorant people find love compassion and respect for all of gods children .
- - Rather depressing video  besides the xavi puyol part .
  - Well it was a pretty bad year all in all . We lost almost all of the important matches .
- - People have a tendency to get pissed when the joke becomes reality . It happens .
  - This is true . It was just frustrating . But I am perfectly happy with myself now .
- - I ... do nt know what to say  but know that I read it all .
  - Haha  well  thanks for sticking through it . It helped for me just to write it .
- - Crashes are interesting when they re pivotal to the plot . two championship rivals colliding . Like action sequences in films they need meaning
  - Absolutly  This video does nt bare it s name well .
- - The newest Tomb Raider is the only thing close and its fantastic .
  - Thanks  I ll give it a try 
- - aah  then our group was nt the same . D
  - oh i did not travel in a group  just a friend and me . good luck with your PAN card .
- - On very long road trips I ll start singing along to songs in the most stupid ways I can . falsetto  growling  pitch changes . Whatever sounds the silliest .
  - oh my goodness I do this all the time 
- - Oh damn  thanks a lot for this  this is amazing . Well  so long Spotify  you wo nt be missed 
  - I could never get that to work for me . Either in Linux or a windows vm ... have nt tried on my osx comp yet though
- - And what empire or country do you lead 
  - My household . So just three others ; but I hope to expand rapidly . We are offering free healthcare and pensions for everyone .
- - Cornbread and maple syrup . You re welcome .
  - I may just die ... sounds soooo good .
- - Would you guys prefer me to tell you all of the games which will be a part of the challenge now or would you like to be surprised each week

  - Haha yeah i noticed after that i misread the comment xD
- - Are there speakers on only one side when holding landscape 
  - Yes but I think the bottom bezel has two speakers .
- - Adapt to what they find fun  It s not like these people ca nt play with sprint  they just do nt enjoy it .
  - That s fine . It s allowed for people not to enjoy any given video game . I ca nt find a problem with it .
- - finally something to get me to try the vegetarian diet
  - That s going to be a hard transition man .
- - since when can you go back several minutes after the fact and reevaluate a score 
  - they tried to like a minute after  but i guess the replay wasnt working or something and they ran out of time during the timeout
- - the thing is due to my work and personal problems i cant date very well
  - Better to be single than to be in an unhealthy relationship . You do nt always have to be with someone ...
- - Ooh ballet  You re the first ballet dancer I ve ever Metz  that s cool 
  - Yup  Though I ve been told to do nt act the part out of the studio  it s what I do .
- - It will be out before you know it .
  - Yeah a lot of the digital games this gen have the habit of showing up or being officially announced a week or less before they hit the store
- - Is it typical for people who frequent this sub to take advice from the founding documents 
  - Where they advocate a less statist point of view  why would nt we 
- - Chrono Trigger  So much replay value  and it took me over a decade to finally finish .
  - I really enjoyed the opening story that introduces the main problem  really grabbed my attention and kept me playing for years .
- - I am a Breaking Bad fan and I think Game of Thrones is boring and not even comparable .
  - They re simplifying a lot of plotlines and character development from the books  it s basically glorified fanfiction now .
- - It really is nt . Both are great sports in their own way . What reasons do you have for saying that football is better 
  - He s a troll man  He knows not what he writes .
- - You know I m stupid . I saw that and consciously thought about it because it reminded me of destiny .
  - Lol it s all good man  I m stupid too  To fools playing together 
- - It s a myth that only uploading is illegal . If you re connected to the swarm they can send you a letter .
  - I m telling you what the letter said . It said uploading . What part of that Is a myth 
- - I usually just lick it off  but your way sounds more refined .
  - I do too . More difficult due to skinny man status though

- - He should nt have played the game in the first place .

- - Thanks but looking for global . trying to maximize my fusing
  - Global usually does nt release dates beforehand .
- - Since you re a civilian  how the hell are you getting thanked if you re not in uniform 
  - I would assume he s told people about it .
- - I live in that area  I ll keep an eye out . A picture might help .
  - Added a pic to my post . Thank you .
- - I do nt get why this is creepy  I would have totally smiled . Much better than a generic message .
  - I think most of those comments were people that just read the title . It was a bit of a bait and switch on my part haha .
- - Not to the extent evident by his T . E test . Even if it did  you do nt get to be Jon Jones with testosterone that low unless ...
  - Thats not what the evidence is saying .
- - Actually ... It would be changing its path as it goes by astronomical objects  maybe even sucked right into them like a vacuum cleaner sucking up lint .
  - The gravitational pull in an object is based on its mass . It will only slightly change course at its worst .
- - Oberyn vs the mountain felt rushed . Pretty corny in some parts . They could have done better .
  - I felt in the books the Oberyn part was over even quicker . I was surprised that he was in it for that long really on the show
- - I m nervous cause I never posted a pic like this before to strangers online  Lol
  - And we are all quite grateful and admire your courage

  - Why s that  It says in their TOS they can discontinue it whenever .
- - I m amazed you can be in that kind of shape and be an EMT . I d figure the workload would at least keep you at some kind of level .
  - Nope  I know a couple EMTs and they tend to run the full spectrum .
- - Makes sense . That thing has been nothing but trouble
  - Pro tip . Killer nics are rip offs anyway . Intel all the way .
- - Since when ca nt you sharpen certain knives  If they re metal  you can sharpen them .
  - There are ceramic knives too  they re cheaper
- - You would need to copy the files to another external or somewhere else . Formatting erases everything on the drive as part of the process .
  - Should I just load up my essential files to a cloud service like Box or Mega

  - Looks like you have a follower too hahaha  I ll try and negate their down votes  keep on keeping on
  - Thanks - I m entertained that someone thinks I m so important that they need to follow and down vote me . Silly - this is the INTERNET  not life 
- - We need a background banner maybe a big minecraft mountain
  - Yeah . We were thinking the same thing  or atleast some banner . We ll make it as soon as possible  but still have it look good .
- - Watching K. Love on D is baffling at times
  - Believe it or not Irving was worse his first few years . Irving turned it around so I hope Love can close the gap to an average defender .
- - I really wish a Jmod had the balls to touch this post and comment on it
  - That would nt be balls  it d be stupidity . All it would accomplish would be a quick firing with no improvement .
- - Just a headsup . Most of what I find is normally due to running through Roguelike Dungeons  last level . It s around the level of the lava lakes
  - Oh okay  I m not familiar with the Roguelike Dungeons mod .
- - Only the most beautiful piece of knitting on earth . Your version is glorious  are you keeping it 
  - Thank you so much  I m definitely keeping it -- it s already kept me warm a couple times 
- - Maybe there are nt that many because she s not comfortable with just two people . I personally do nt like talking to people one on one
  - Do you wan na talk about it 
- - This game is all on Solomon . No excuse why did you run out of pocket 
  - he did the entire time . we had pressure on him
- - Another good one is fine clothes because of their cost to weight ratio and they can be enchanted
  - Clothes are pretty comparatively rare  plus they tend not to be able to have the most expensive enchantments placed on them like jewelry or weapons can .

  - I ve defended GlenX a zillion times in this sub and I m glad to see us wake up again to his awesomeness .
- - I have a couple hundred code cards from recent sets  would you be interested in a trade for a couple EX cards 
  - Absolutely  which codes do you have and which cards are you interested in 
- - He can also go on to kill someone . Just playing devils advocate .
  - Maybe  but that s not the convenience store owner s fault . Killing somebody  even in self defense  is a traumatic experience that can ruin your life .
  - That s something that would differ from person to person
  - True  but I do nt think you re making your point very clear .
- - You are not a true Frenchman if you do nt vote for Le Pen . Think about your future  France .
  - Is nt Le Pen also homophobic  You d think she would get on with these muslims opinions .
- - Just wondering is the crouching because of lack of movement 
  - Sometimes you should crouch  it s good for dodging .
- - As someone who just kind of stumbled upon this picture and comments thread  I m severely confused .
  - Just try it . Put windmill cookies on your bread . With butter .
- - How excited are you to play the pistons now 
  - I for one welcome the true lords of the Central division .
- - Did you install them correctly  in the dual channel setup specified in your motherboard manual

  - whoops my bad  didnt know a comment on the thread was necessary  ill let him know
- - That s terrible . Awful . Why the fuck do people like this exist 
  - it s not because of their religion . so do nt even think of going there .
- - What do nt you like about hangouts 
  - Desktop support sucks . Imessage you can drag and drop any file in to send . It s awesome
- - Because Europe was such a peaceful place before muslim immigrants arrived .
  - In fact  yes . modern Europe  established on democratic  liberal ideals after the world wars  was a very peaceful place indeed before Islam started flexing its muscles .
- - It s ok she swallowed a package of hot dogs .
  - Finally someone makes sense of this story .
- - A person born with male sex organs can identify as a woman if he so pleases and there s nothing wrong with that either .
  - Regardless of whether you agree with that statement  looking at a male body does not give us any useful insight into how a healthy female body is shaped .
- - Looks like we re getting Baltimore  I was really hopeing for a Steelers win as I d rather see Cincy or Indy ...
  - Funny though we want the higher seeded opponent ... I agree though
- - That s some shocking defensive work from wasps right there . Wade made to look foolish but his centres got it all so wrong .
  - Daly slips forcing Wade to have to go inside to cover which creates an overlap on the outside for May .
- - I stopped playing one or two releases ago  and have used simple scaffolding as my entrance  which can be hastily deconstructed .
  - Have you experienced the tunneling goblins yet  If you do nt kill all the raiders they comeback  make a tunnel and show up randomly in your village .
- - Everyone has the right to entertain the general public
  - He is not entertaining the people . He is trying to brain wash them by his idiotic logics . And that is not acceptable . This is a simple fraud .
- - The myth is if you ever meet GabeN you ll never see your wallet again .
  - Problem is  Our overlord supreme leader savior and redeemer GabeN blessed be thy name  is everywhere  or he will be at least just give him some time .

  - Pretty much all the channel s videos are like that  . D
- - good . she should stay there until she gets some slight nerfs
  - Slight  you used the wrong word . extreme .
- - Ambrose does nt deserve this . Keeps losing in poorly booked feuds . Dude was red hot at one point .
  - I thought we were supposed to complain about Wyatt losing his matches .
- - I for one  am totally bored with blonde haired  blue eyed woman  there a dime a dozen .
  - Then use your free time to study up on grammar .
- - Warlock . Holy shit his Chinese voice is so bad . A part of the lines are nothing but slow unintelligible moans .
  - His voice is basically the same in English .
- - Serious question  you missed your connecting flight . What happened to your checked baggage if you had any 
  - I did nt have any . I always try to travel light .
- - im sorry  i cant hear you over the em pulses and solar flares .
  - Open your doors and vent the oxygen . Fires die . Solar flares are cake .
  - alright  how about the time i went up against a boarder  who hit my door systems with hacking  during a solar storm .
  - I m not saying you do it every single time .
- - It is certainly denying frivolous cases  but it would nt hurt to strike a better balance between whether the case has merit or not that court fees can be refunded .
  - The government is simply covering the arses of their rich mates .
- - Nazeebo s first master skin tint says hello .
  - Got ta check that too I guess .
- - They also had no time to read the newest draft of the Healthcare act . It s common for popular bills to be pushed through without it being read .
  - I wonder if they do nt read it because their lobbyists who wrote it told them what was beneficial in it for them ...
- - Yeah a lot of the ones i hated the most had their moments of good . Like when Metatron was first introduced lol
  - Yeah . Metatron was funny and I like the actor but then he has his evil moments and I wanted him dead .
- - So what s the solution to this  This pretty much sums up my current life situation .
  - I think you need to start over . I did  anyhow .
- - Might want to lower your price its pretty high especially since the back corner is cracked .
  - Noted . I m open to offers .
- - So if I was a kangaroo I could DP my chick without another dude  Fuckin  sold 
  - So  you are quitting your job to become a kangaroo 
- - These are all lesser crimes ... We believe in the death penalty for murder and adultery . For lesser crimes there are lesser punishments .
  - Why is having consensual sex a crime 
- - seems like all the cool kids had this blanket
  - Hell yes . I had names for them too . If bugs brontosaurus was nt by my head I d always freak the hell out .
- - looks like my scepticism of the Stars report about Bowe was justified . What a piece of shit
  - lol Posted the link above  absolute joke . Not even subbing like  they just pulled that whole article out their arse .
- - I was thinking of a short tail . I forgot they have pretty much no tail .
  - No they do nt  they have a fairly long tail . It needs to be cut off to become a stub . Just look up pictures of undocked boxers online
- - Right now it seems that way but eventually youll have an abundance of radiants
  - I think that would happen with just running the raid .
- - He asked what it was  not for a shitty overused joke .
  - I think he was going to say that to anything that was posted no matter what .
- - I think I am going to try to make alcohol today . Or this weekend .
  - Is this a polite way of saying you have a yeast infection 
  - No . I told you remember  When I was looking high and low for the wine biscuit  I found it in Chinatown the other day 
  - Oh  right . I thought alcohol was just a byproduct and not the desired outcome .
- - Did somebody smash their license plate into your bumper  
  - unfortunately yes ... along with the rest of their car .
- - Man  Millsap is balling out of his fucking mind tonight .
  - I bet an Aldridge for him that we would win this one so I m looking forward to starting him next week
- - Thx  New to iOS programming and am going through obj-c study now . Should I focus on swift instead or just proceed to it after obj-c 
  - No  stick with Objective-C until Apple irons out the issues . You re going to need to be familiar with it anyways since all the APIs are written in Objective-C .
- - I ca nt figure out why people liked this movie that much . I really did not enjoy it at all .
  - I also strongly disliked it . It does nt work as a metaphor and it does nt really work as a straightforward movie .
- - In other topics  there s this girl at work who looks a LOT like Sunset Shimmer  It s uncanny  now that I ve noticed it .
  - You must get us photo for science . By any means necessary .
- - Just people who have a different opinion than you right 
  - Nope  just as bloodthirsty internet tough guys .
- - Still does nt explain why he feels the need to tell these people to go to the authorities now but he did nt feel the need to tell them back then .
  - Maybe OP was reluctant to come forward as an adolescent . Now  he s an adult ... Just a thought .
- - Well then  I ll stay away from Colorado .
  - I m from Colorado  ca nt say I ve ever experienced that and have seen a lot of dudes with the flow
- - You ca nt win every game - it s simply not possible .
  - Even in the grand finals of the most skilled tournament in the world  someone has to lose
- - Is this what he said at the presser today 
  - I think it was a request for the missus .
- - Definitely not immune - empathy does nt cause all depression .
  - Psychopathy can not co-exist with depression in the same person . Or its not psychopathy then .
- - Yeah  I have nt been big on NPH in his more recent film roles . If there was one weak link in Gone Girl  it was him .
  - i actually think this helped get the unsettling nature of the character s representation on the film as Gone Girl seemed more metaphorical than a story to be taken literally .
- - I actually do nt know anything about overclocking dude .
  - Ahhh sorry wrong thread . Nevertheless  the PSU is fine . It s one of the best in the market .
- - I think both sexes can choose to be promiscuous  it just depends on how low you want to reach into the bottom of the barrel
  - Male promiscuity is generally not as frowned upon . Particularly if a man decides it s part of his past . Women are generally willing to overlook that .
- - It pisses me off when Derrick Williams feels like playing hard  because what the hell is he thinking in all the other games 
  - I feel like when we watch him agaisnt the wolves we re seeing what he could be .
- - Could be worse . Based on the title I was expecting Lee to W to a low HP teammate and bring a Jinx rocket along or something .
  - Could be worse  imagine bringing a brand ult into your entire team of super low allies
- - The kid would be worth more money .
  - A lot harder to get money from taking the kid .
- - Wow ... this was a depressing way to spend my new year . Great movie .
  - sorry bro  glad you liked it though 
- - It s one step closer to legitimizing the Pro cod scene .
  - So you would make them never be able to make team changes then  If they are nt able to change before the biggest event of the year when can they 
- - Am I the only one here wondering how Steely Dan got thrown in here  So fucking happy .
  - Jazzy Dad Rock  ALL . DAY 
- - He is good  but he is far from the best IMO
  - yeah there are obviously loads of sick UK MCs out there  always gunna be up for debate . just saying I reckon he s up there 
- - Yeah  but you re really attractive . Life has to be a little bit fair .
  - Well thank you very much and i would say it has been . I m not a very pessimistic in the slightest so it would nt get to me
- - Why do nt you think the Mets will be able to compete  I m kinda afraid of them tbh
  - Offense . I know Wright and Murphy will be healthy but IMO they re still a couple of players away
- - Stolen from his work desk or not  he owes you the money . All of it .
  - Such a nice league you have here  it would be a shame if something ... happened to it .
- - As an Oriental  I personally love using Occident whenever I can . Westerner just does nt have the same flare as Occidental .
  - How can it be an occident if you say it on purpose
- - How . It looks fat  explain how that is good
  - He would look that way if someone saw him gliding through the air .
- - Maybe they have to look at the thread before making it available . Be patient .
  - I know  it s just frustrating is all .
- - Feature . Malfunction is a little harsh .
  - I guess it depends on the camera angle .
- - Have you had any luck  I live down there  I ll keep my eyes peeled if he s still missing .
  - He s still missing . Thank you for the help .
- - So what did people do in night clubs  Just stand around all night 
  - They did nt have real nightclubs  just places to sit around and eat and drink .
- - I wish to get rid of the nervousness though
  - Even I was nervous . I stuttered a bit  but the conversation went fine . We just need some more practice .
- - Do nt forget to post in the scammer thread on the sidebar and post proof .
  - Well  I do nt have any proof . I can post a picture of our xbox message convo  but thats about it .
- - Vincent Kompany . Along with Zabaleta  probably the player who evokes the most emotion from fans for his passion . Also a beast CB .
  - Kompany could be the CEO of my company
- - After what happened in Paris I expect pegida to spread like a wildfire .
  - Came here to point out how much more salient a point this is now from just yesterday .
- - Now you re gettin  it  Champ 
  - It takes some people so long to figure the simple stuff out .
- - I just looked at your resource and I was almost sick - so dry  use something  anything  else
  - I ve been working through the Odin Project as a total beginner and I love it .
- - Yes  but it is not accurate .
  - Yes  it s not accurate . All it s doing is displaying the value of the progress bar .
- - Sorry if stupid question . Is laser hair removal down there  something that can be done 
  - It might be  but I know that feels like a sunburn and I think I ll stick with the hair over that .
- - That pollution though . Any trouble out of biters 
  - I actually reduced attacks recently after clearing out a bunch of near by camps for the alien orb things .
- - Not to SU . I mean maybe the episodes of AT are connected somehow .
  - Oh  well maybe . Yeah  they seem to be random  but they have an overall plot to it .
- - Question . how do you make it evolve 
  - I dont . Just like when I was a kid with no link cable .
- - Oh i gave up already  I just wanted to be a cool kid with a bendy phone . c
  - Haha we all want to be that kid . That s why I got this one xD to turn heads
  - Minus the features . I might just break and buy a pebble .
  - Huh well  for that price I just might too 
- - If that s true  then would nt the Lantern Rings  Mjolnir  and any particularly OP gun be superheroes too 
  - It s not a hero  it s a machine that turns a regular hero wielding it into a superhero .
- - Kill me Baby in the case that anyone does nt know
  - thank you  i did nt know myself
- - You re awesome  Small is my size . Always on the lookout for cool tanks ; just bought one . Thanks 
  - No problem  Hopefully it works out well for you 
- - May wan na take a refresher English class to work out the difference between to  and too  before you start trying to lecture anyone on a subject .
  - he mean he s not right but if your only argument is you made a spelling error maybe you should nt be criticizing him ...
- - So cute  Which pattern did you use 
  - I made it up  it s pretty basic
- - You could hear him speeding up towards the end and I think he was probably aware he might be in danger of getting told to stop at any moment .
  - Yea this is probably why it was such a short review .
- - Tim Cahill - national treasure  lord and saviour  digs us out of holes  scores a shit load of goals .
  - AH GIT FACKED  GIT ABSOLUTELY FACKED
