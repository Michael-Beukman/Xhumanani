  - The former . Offenses against property and other natural rights should be punished -- just not by a state with a monopoly on violence .
- - If you turned a left hand glove inside out  which hand would it fit on 
  - I need to go hit something in frustration

  - I do nt know how ... can i just email it to you instead 
- - NO PHARRELL THAT IS JUST A FENCE OR WALL .
  - Technically if it s an enclosed space it would be a pen or an enclosure .
  - So if I ve got a white picket fence all the way around my house  I should be calling it a white picket enclosure 
  - Your house is a house because of the room  your property includes all of the rest of the land  presumably including the fence .
- - Sorry thinking of keeping that  unless it gets me something from my wishlist . thanks for offer though .
  - No problem hope you have a great day .
- - Holy shit  WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH SOME PEOPLE ...
  - This pretty much sums up my reaction too . So sad
- - Why would proximity to the stadium matter for an away game 
  - Ha  yeah  was nt thinking . But I still think parking is easier in Fells compared to Fed Hill .
- - Had mine tattooed . Worst and best .
  - What was the subject matter of the tattoo 
- - Yes  but you can not force anyone to forgive you ...
  - I said ask  not force . Whether or not they forgive you is their choice .
- - Bought all of them from Bandcamp quite a while ago  so does nt matter much for me .
  - Nice  You re right on supporting independent musicians  thanks for that 
- - That would only make them more financially unstable .
  - Yup . Yet another economically incompetent article . What a surprise . Not .
- - Protein shakes never satiate me  I stopped drinking them
  - Honestly they make me feel sick . I do however keep an emergency supply just in case I do nt get enough protien from food that day .
- - Once again  Metal Blade trumps the alternatives . Is Hyper Bomb really that bad that it did nt even get in a single set  though 
  - It s not bad  it s just that metal blade is THAT good .
- - It s an ideal name for a fracking company ...
  - This is nt Battlestar Galactica you can curse on the internet ...
- - I know about half of the names  but I only actually know the music of weird al .
  - Yeah  Weird Al is the only one for me . I do like his music  too .
- - Whats the chances this is you  and whats the chance this is a repost  with the same title bar one word or a comma 
  - Well the really is my dog  and my dad . I can shower you multiple pics .
- - Do you grind the little stem also 
  - Nope  the stem went into my stem stash . Thinking it s time to make some tea .
- - i ll try and bypass my shyness to possibly come out .
  - Oh come on . I have it on good authority that you are smooth .
- - Just a reminder . Your comment was never removed  but you are getting close to crossing the bounds to personal attacks .
  - For what was the question . I m always close to crossing the bounds it seems .
- - Even though he has nt been identified yet  this is fantastic news 
  - Agreed  Hopefully it leads us on a good path .
- - Still really enjoyed commentating most of that tournament with ya .
  - You too man  it was really fun . You re def one of the better commentators in Chicago
- - Rioter said it ll be fixed next patch .
  - Yes and temporary fix is to make sure you deselect and reselect the skin you want
- - I m definitely going to try lower sensitivity now
  - its actually about experience and preference . low sense will really help tho
- - Stamps are cheap enough that counterfeiting them is not worth the effort for most people .
  - This and penalties for counterfeiting them will land you in prison . It s not worth it .
- - try adding some minced garlic and fresh thai chilies to your dumpling dipping sauce . looks great .
  - I actually did  It just all sank to the bottom when I took the picture lol .
- - I bet Pace kills it in Fantasy Football .
  - Dude  I am totally drafting him next year .
- - I wish Gouffran would stop starting ... so much more quality available
  - We benched Williamson  so let us take victories where we can get them .
- - I buy my gems from amazon in USD because it s cheaper than the EU prices . l
  - Where  from what i can see  the amazon prices are higher
- - I guess we wont see ulduar because mages already have flame leviathan as a card .
  - I do nt think that will matter too much . The issue with Ulduar is that all the mech stuff just happened and it would be repetitive .
- - Minimal or factory  ca nt fully remember  this was a while ago
  - all right  thanks for the input though 
- - Because inland China needs the wealth that is brought in from the coastal cities in order to build important infrastructure  deal with natural disasters  etc .
  - It sounds like a waste of money and resources  this is something that the CCP is good at .
- - Yea but it s too frowned upon nowadays . Maybe the Bunny Farm  Or red light district  Or just a smokin hot girlfriend would do ...
  - Pretty sure if they had a girlfriend they would nt need the brothel ...
- - How can I find a foreclosure auction to buy a cheap house 
  - A lot of the times they are held on the steps of your local courthouse .
- - And soon to be packed full of STD s
  - If I have anything to say about it exactly 
- - So do you know the actual reason she s blowing you off  or just that bullshit line she fed you 
  - Almost certainly a bullshit reason . I ve been dismissed .
- - Very cool . What other games are you working with 
  - I m looking Into last of us  and possibly Infamous . Drive clubs photo mode looks interesting but I have nt worked with cars before .
- - How dare they point out a chest for you  Why would I take the time to look someone up on Grimoire while on patrol 
  - Pointing once is fine . But Pointing multiple times is a little annoying .
- - Try refreshing it  It was sold out earlier but the pre-order button is up 
  - THIS  Just got my order in 
- - Your parents are awesome -- I hope you appreciate that 
  - Yes they are and I definitely do 
- - Yay  You re back . I was beginning to wonder where you d disappeared to . Wishing you the best with HRT .
  - Yerp  I m back  Thanks for the good luck wishes 
- - the random horizontal recoil is actually a very bad thing  especially for a long raged weapon .
  - Every weapon in the game with non-zero horizontal recoil has it entirely random .
- - Thank you so much for writing all of this out  It sounds delicious I will definitely be trying this recipe .
  - You re welcome  I hope you like it .
- - That would be the worst sex toy ever 
  - Agreed  just reading the description on the site 
- - OSU is totally outplaying Bama so far . This should nt be close .
  - feels like the turnovers and red zone offense in the first half would ve sunk them . really impressive to play through that and be winning .
- - I guess what they say is true . everything IS bigger in Texas  tits included .
  - Well  not quite everything  but these are . Lol
- - Happy can  I read an article string that can counters are being trialled ATM  and will be mandatory in the near future .
  - What  just at happy can or other places too  I ve not been to HC before ... you ve gotten good results there 
- - What does a Raven have in common with a writing desk  EDIT . Poe wrote on both you ignorant fucks
  - Both are untouched in all of Pittsburgh 
- - i guess its just BBC radio for us then  and then highlights on spurs tv tomorrow
  - any notion on how to stream radio  especially not in the UK 
- - These calls are sketch  but apparently none of you guys watched the first half  cowboys were getting the shit end of the stick then .
  - I know right  The first half was all against the cowboys and no one acknowledges it
- - You have heard others say that Reform and Orthodox Judaism are not from the same roots 
  - Same roots  sure . But also just that far away from those roots .
- - If she pulled back on the eyelash and eyeliner  she would kind of look like Stephanie McMahon with tats .
  - How about that weird lipstick and the drawn on eyebrows  Basically  just wipe her face clean .
- - Is he OP  I m not well versed in competitive battling .
  - No . Its Fake Out is pretty powerful but anything fast or something with priority just kills it .
- - We have two true freshman playing in the secondary right now . Scary
  - And they re twins . Unless it s Step Durham playing .
- - I thought Julio Cesar to QPR was a joke
  - Never thought I d see him play for TFC  either .
- - I d love to see this but with Tom Brady .
  - It s pretty much the same graph . Give or take a win here and a loss there .
  - What about the year Tom Brady was injured and Matt Cassel played 
  - That s why I said give or take a win here and a loss there .
- - It s basically the same as a baby that learns to talk
  - not really ... First language acquisition is a completely different process from learning a foreign language .
- - So  if I ended up not lowering my gaze  I m out 
  - No brother . It is about becoming better . But if you PMO you are out .
- - We have reached triple or quadruple repost . May god have mercy on our souls .
  - Maybe I ll repost it right now . THE HEAVENS SHALL BURN AND THE HELLS SHALL FREEZE AT THE MIGHTY POWER OF THE INSTANT REPOST
- - Not sure if you re in the US but do nt forget Yelp .
  - I do nt think anyone takes yelp seriously because it s gotten so bad . FB is the way to go to be taken more seriously .
- - you dont need vpn anymore ... but i dont know why it doesnt download sorry
  - Some people will still need VPN or DNS workaround .
- - Yeah  mine has been broken for a few weeks now . Every time I tap it  the screen quickly flickers and that s it .
  - That s EXACTLY what mine is doing .
- - I was at one of their first shows . I feel positively ancient now .
  - What was it like  I wish I could have seen them live
- - Schweinsteiger for sure . Alonso is great for the coins though  only negative thing about him is he gets tired easily .
  - Ok thanks I ll be getting schweinsteiger hopefully later today
- - Post your questions here  as you may help someone in the future .
  - This . Maybe you can help others at the same time .
- - Why do nt you leave your house  What s living got to do with vomiting  Are you more comfortable vomiting in your own house 
  - Yes for some reason I would rather throw up at home than in public .
- - I d love to hear more . Let me erase some things from my post history first .
  - Lol  you re starting on the right track already 
- - You should do a Kickstarter to raise the funds to pay yourself to make it a series .
  - Ahh that takes time and money  better make an indigogo to get that going
- - I ca nt believe people are trying to argue the Domi call . That s textbook charging .
  - I do nt think its a very known penalty  people hear charging and assume the player ran across the ice for the hit .
- - Lamp was dumb  frustrating for people trying to do it legit .
  - Flying after explosions was SO COOL though . Going to miss it a lot .
- - We have the technology where blind people can have text to voice conversion and also interpreters . You can search ways blind people browse the Internet for more

  - Also Napoleon has the apple  pretty useful guy
- - Now make some lift out boxes to place inside and call it a jewelry box . Add some inlays to the top as well if you know how .
  - Thanks - I ve attempted to kick around a few options . The wife insists it will remain a baby coffin no matter what I do to it
- - Those are nt really emotions  though .
  - Neither are death  willpower  life  and being feared .
- - They were pretty good  its a shame that they broke up .
  - Really is a shame . Only made two albums .
- - This belongs in Game Bundles  since it s not free .
  - Scroll down to the email input area and type it in . The art is fairly neat but it is not a game .
- - Thanks but the idea does nt particularly interest me and I do nt think I could really be an effective mod without getting somewhat immersed into the world you re making .
  - I understand . Thanks for the response  though .
- - Basically  Ash actually knows what he s doing for once
  - Do nt worry  I m sure he ll scrub it up .
  - Smogon will rewrite the script and have Ash release Greninja because he s too OP .
  - Chances are that it is nt protean  without protean its not OP .
- - Look for popped capacitors near the power jack .
  - I ll give that a shot  If no popped or bulging  do I need to start testing them with the ohmmeter on my multimeter

- - Umm can someone explain to me what happened in the twist  Who s the killer  Is it Anderson or Sarah  Did Anderson frame Sarah 
  - The narrator was the killer  by he blamed Sarah for being the killer . Anderson was the narrator s old boss .
- - Actually it s completely normal when the sane have difficulty understanding the behavior of the insane .
  - It s like the old saying goes . do nt expect a cat to know how a dog barks .
- - LOL . I think there ll be some on release in stores  though .
  - i believe she will be like luigi where people bought him just to be safe but he never left the shelfs .
- - Really  Did someone pull a fast one and returned their pair with swapped phones

  - Put your gamer tag in here and people may add you .
- - Just by the fact that you consider the number of nuclear weapons as a valid proof of which country is the strongest tells a lot about your understanding of global events .
  - This is not in any way  shape  or form what I said . Come back when you have something more than a ridiculous strawman .
- - Its absolutely fake . The speed that it is traveling is way too slow . Just watch any other meteor videos and compare .
  - I ca nt speak to the other parts of his point  but I have personally witnessed a meteor traveling at this apparent speed .
- - Really  you just say the first pun that springs to mind
