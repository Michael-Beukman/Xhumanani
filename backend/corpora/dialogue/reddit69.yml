- - I know you did nt ask for an apology . You did recommend to OP to apologize . I think that s a ludicrous thing to do .
  - Why is it ludicrous for the OP to apologize for upsetting the gf  I do nt follow this at all .

  - Democrats are the same as Republicans they sold us out it is a trick both side same all hope lost despair despair despair despair ...
- - Does anyone else think that this map overly spams the mountain terrain feature  It looks like this scenario took just minutes to construct .
  - That is probably true  although I think the pre-built coaster took longer to make
- - yeah I wondered this myself  would it not be considered technically a complete collection if I do nt have all the other regional versions too 
  - It probably depends on the person entirely . And how much they re willing to spend .

  - You could always make a completely contrary one to piss off all the people not offended in this ranking .

- - Why do all the new guys hate Tanahashi 
  - I just prefered Okada . Tanahashi was awesome in the ring though  his character just was nt the kind I root for . No hate 
- - hmm i dont think i wan na leave this garden yet but thanks fo the detailed explination 
  - I personally would nt recommend it since PSP games can be emulated even on phones .
- - You will know how you did at the end of the night  you tell us . Enjoy .
  - It was eventful lol I ll put it that way
- - Why did you keep dating this guy with all these red flags popping up  I m genuinely curious .
  - Because I was blind to them until after the big incident happened . Then I looked back on everything and realized he was a psycho
- - Holy these fan girls . Everytime Faker gets a kill they shout .
  - he is the superstar of OGN now more than ever . Fan girls love winners and korean fan girls REALLY love winners

  - I actually felt the same way watching it back after all these years ...

  - I got them from Jim s site directly .
- - No link to any article or statement by Hoynes  no quotes  spelling errors  grammatical errors  and a total lack of paragraph breaks make this a bad submission .
  - In the writer s defense  an actual byline is not used . The little kid probably has nt learned that yet . Anyway  I posted Hoynes article link below .
- - Wait . What was that about Borderlands  I ca nt find an IMDB page about you in a Borderlands game that s already out ...
  - I m assuming he means Telltale s Tales From The Borderlands in which he plays one of the lead protagonists .

  - That s just what I needed to hear .

- - I always thought violence was the other half . Clearly I was wrong and you have the documentation to prove it .
  - Best just to stick with stealing shoes .
- - Because you do nt need to play the game to purchase hats . Kappa
  - This just in . Dota to become Neopets .
- - maybe someone in his party dropped it on the ground and he thought it was a monster drop .
  - That s more or less what happened .
- - And you re pulling off that hot pink outfit . Not everyone can do that .
  - Thank you  XD It was my Christmas present .

- - She s tsundere and you know it ...
  - She clearly just wanted senpai to notice .
- - Clearly shows you were flirting with him .

  - But you would have left that part out of your complaint . Get involved in the film biz to cast who you want or quit complaining .
  - Right because only people who work in a field have a right to criticize . No doubt you ve never complained about politics . Idiot .
- - I wonder is it possible to have um ... like other people to bounce ideas or help proof read each others captions before they go up  That would be neato .

  - The accuracy of this statement is astounding .
- - Unfortunately  seems very unlikely . The only talk of a new pavilion I ve heard is for Puerto Rico  and that was only that they re interested .
  - Awww  that s sad . I guess I should just make do with the German pavilion .

  - True but public shaming is way better than passive aggressive shaming

  - There are great things about this city  but when I read a story like this  I feel very ashamed .

  - Me too - I d even travel down from Liverpool to see it .
- - It would be nice but leftism is far too well entrenched in US and Canada  especially in Canada where there are no proper right-wing parties .
  - The UK is more leftwing than the US . Your comment is moronic nonsense .
- - Our bench turns into the Ginyu force every so often .

  - nope  but you do sound mad . awh cry more baby 
- - Ah gotcha . I had not heard about Lindley since I saw the game .
  - Well they have nt said anything about roster moves  but if is nt cut I ll be shocked .
- - That one with the whale in captivity . I think the whale was named Michael Moore or something .
  - Yes  it s very sad how his hat just sags to one side now ... like he is nt happy or something .
- - U can also lock apps with biolockdown with a passcode
  - Thanks for telling me that  I did nt know the difference .
- - Tinker Tailor Solider Spy . The main antagonist and protagonist never meet though there is one amazing monologue from the protagonist about the only time he met the antagonist .
  - The TV series depicts their meeting  it s a really great scene and I d highly recommend watching the series if you enjoyed the movie 
- - Yeah it s as they were riding back . You can almost see the decision in his face .
  - Thanks  that s what I had figured .
- - Served in pan because I m out of dishwasher detergent and dishes . Everything is a plate now .
  - Plates are over rated . Eating straight out of the pan is far more efficient anyway .
- - Show him some support from the meat team . Dudes got it hard ... Try not to let him lose his job on top . Goodluck man .
  - This was awhile back . He did nt get fired  he d been working there for way too long for that .
- - Biased opinion and the play was nt over
  - Whistle had nt blown and the RB was fighting for yards . Soooo dirty
- - Instead of telling me the acronym . You wrote a sentence telling someone else to tell me the acronym
  - The acronym is the beggining of his sentence .
- - So is that a face mask when it s done in that manner 
  - Its supposed to be  but like any other penalty is inconsistent
- - And can only hold two bikes at a time 
  - Might not be any bike riders in the town ... or if you have these in a lot of places then it makes sense ...
- - Wot ... There was literally a song at the beginning arabian nights or something ... Have you seen the movie its pretty clear ...
  - I m talking og Aladdin  not Disney Aladdin . Ie from a thousand and one Arabian nights book .
- - DH . DO we have tO vOte 
  - SH . Yo for what  this 
  - DH . I suppOse ... I dO nt really think we need a leader .
  - SH . Yo  then that s your vote . Do nt be so unsure of yourself man  follow your instincts .
  - DH . I just dO nt want people to be upset with me .
  - SH . Yo that happens sometimes  you need to learn to stand your ground .
  - DH . I suppOse ... DH . SOmetimes it s easier tO stand dOwn if it makes Other peOple happy .
  - SH . Yo  being a team is all about compromise
  - DH . Well I guess sO ... DH . SO if we have nO leader  what happens when peOple fight with each Other 
  - SH . Yo  we work it out as a team SH . Yo we re gon na work together
  - DH . Well ... I guess sO . DH . SOrry .
  - SH . Yo it s no big deal man  we re cool .
  - DH . Okay well ... What have the Others said abOut this 
  - SH . Yo  people are still talking  but most seem to think that leaders are a stupid idea
  - DH . This just may nOt gO dOwn well .
  - SH . Yo  what do you mean 
- - Just make them removable without the move deleter  in my opinion . Or make items that take the place of HM s .
  - yes  crash the game by removing surf while surfing
- - Sure  I am not an inactive user  I can do that . I am available now .
  - Ok awesome  I will add you and head online now 
- - WWE needs to never come back to Corpus Christi again . I ve heard libraries louder than that crowd .
  - More like corpse Christi  because they make as much noise as a corpse .
- - So do nt pay for it if it does nt have value to you . No one said you have to use Netflix
  - I mean that s exactly what I said and I never implied that I have to use Netflix but whatever .
- - We are pretty much waiting until NSD or at least until some more visits mid-late Jan as far as I m aware .
  - NSD for Cowart  Martez  and Cece . Big day .
- - It gives you the damn answer in the picture next to the question .
  - Nah  some of those are misleads .
- - He s insanely good on his day  not too many players who can stiff arm a flanker and outpace a winger .
  - Shame is he is rather inconsistent . Never bad  bud just sometimes seems to be very average .
- - You have to build a station piece of track first .
  - No I mean I went on a preloaded roller coaster and got in the cart but I ca nt figure out how to make it start going down the tracks
- - Actually I think prob neither of these two will be . It may be someone like cooper .
  - IMO outside of some of the edge rushers  Cooper is the least likely to bust out of the entire class
- - Deleting the game removes the update . The glitch might work but it could also corrupt your save . So its a big risk . Do it if you want to .
  - I think I may try it after saving in multiple slots . Thanks 
- - I guess I m not seeing an exodus of businesses flocking to high tax states .
  - There is nt much of an exodus away from them either .
- - These are hoodlums and not thugs  Terminology is tough these days .
  - A thug could theoretically beat you up . I am not concerned going toe-to-toe with Lizard Squad .
- - you could just right click save to computer then upload to imgur
  - lol  or I could do that ... brb .
- - Drew  please do nt retire yet . The Falcons might finally get a pass rush this year . I want to see you get hit . Repeatedly .
  - DEs take a while to develop so I hope you re patient unless you are talking about Veteran FA pass rushers .
- - So does this guarantee he goes to heaven 
  - No  it guarantees entry into flatland .
- - I hate to be the one to say this ... but those isis guys are rocking that pose in that picture
  - Seriously . They look like the fundamentalist Expendables .
- - I have not seen her baby pictures and I know she has no middle name
  - Get on those baby pics . We need to confirm she is nt a droid .
- - Obama should now use an executive order to build a big-ass renewable energy thingy right in the path of the proposed pipeline 
  - Nebraskan here . Sounds good . Wind farms are A-OK with me .
- - But that did nt happen in the book . It was genuinely shocking because it was a stupid move .
  - I realise that now  but I guess the way the movie was going  it was kind of obvious what was about to happen .
- - You re dumb  and you should feel bad .
  - Lol  that really hurts my feelings .
- - Feather - was a good shave but do nt see what all the hype is about . Gon na try a few more cheaper ones before using another feather .
  - I agree  have a feather in now for the first time and do nt see a noticeable difference from my previous favorite from my sampler pack  Blue Bird .
- - I did forget him  Is he harder then Marluxia 
  - He does nt have as many combos but he one shots you if you dont have second chance
- - I despise Obama  but really so what  As long as the tax payers did nt get stuck with the bill .
  - Not everything can be reduced to whether the taxpayers end up paying for it or not .
- - But they have no grudges or agenda .
  - Of course they have a grudge  Rowan and Ziggler were on the Survivor Series team that got them fired
- - Ideally I would like to Anderson fighting a true MW and Nick Diaz being set up for a Lawler rematch ...
  - Nick has said in multiple press conferences he will never fight robbie lawler again .
- - Who was saying to put Lucic on the trading block 
  - Everyone that does nt understand the Bruins .
- - Any TES fan knows it was a mistake
  - I think a TES MMO could be done  it s just that ESO was not it .
- - Pavelski has been killing it for me in fantasy this year . Go sharks .
  - I picked him up also . I knew he was gon na be good again this year . He has nt disappointed so far
- - Pretty weak team  should still beat Canada .
  - Pretty young team though  I think it may look weaker than it is  but definitely far from our strongest selection .
- - Haha yeah  I d say so . Glad you did nt have to learn your lesson the hard way  though . Flat sets 
  - I put only dirt holes along this creek .
- - I m not going to take the time to even attempt a rational discussion with a conspiracy theorist . Not worth anyone s time .
  - Well you definitely took the time to argue . You just ran out of things to say .
- - Then what s the point of raid weapons
  - they do almost the same but Do nt take up your exotic slot . Seems pretty straightforward . You can wield your Jelly horn too .
- - I m not usually one for lawyer jokes  but I feel like I know which one of you is a defense attorney .
  - I do nt do criminal  but civil defense . And the other guy is nt a lawyer at all
- - Wait a minute  Shisui did nt kill himself . He just disappeared .
  - nope  jumped off a cliff to awaken Itachi s rage and MS
- - You too . I have never seen someone get a quad feed in this game before with a gun  so that was cool . Good job 
  - I have no idea how that is possible
- - Or cut a broom stick to length  and just lay it in the track . That s what we used to do . Seemed to work the same .
  - We use an old pvc pipe . lol
- - Self development for the sake of all beings
  - All for one  one for all .
- - you can buy the exp share in the market with the third gym  but its the old school exp share  make a pokemon hold it
  - Oh thanks  That would explain why I do nt have it yet . . P Thanks a million 
- - Was that game reviewer Yahtzee  That sounds like something he d say
  - It was indeed  nice catch  haha .
- - We also have the ability to control other species evolution too
  - And have for a very long time .
- - Once you get to this point it s not even worth keeping .
  - Throw the whole phone away is what I might have to do .
- - Keep in mind ... there was a chase car filming him .
  - A man with a camera and a skateboard . The best chase car .
- - Just fire them all already . A bunch of volunteer citizens that actually give a shit would do a better job anyway .
  - You honestly believe that  I would imagine crime would sky rocket . Think you re being a bit naive .
- - I think you need to unlock the arcanist to be able to use masterworks 
  - Yes . And it does nt matter if the schematic is a masterwork one or not .
- - rs was ruined as soon as micro transactions came in  completely went against the game .
  - To a certain extent  yes . But i feel like solomons is nt all that bad . TH is what should be dealt with .
- - Don Frye is a legend but I think he s underestimating Jones here .
  - Go back and watch the predators picks  he is wrong more often then right .
- - Why didnt the ogres spawn after the second pull 
  - It s all about timing . I effectively got an extra sword by glitching out of the starting room and going at the speed I did .
- - Eating a nice  medium-rare ribeye with my hands . My girlfriend and I declared a house rule that eating steak with your hands is always allowed .
  - Ai nt nothin wrong with eating with your hands  bro  Neanderthals did it all the time .
- - Its Gillette Stadium . Not exactly easy to get to from downtown Boston .
  - this gets my vote now  everyone else seems cool to visit
  - Its not like they do nt play great soccer either  in Portland it was nice to take the light rail to everything . I like that option honestly .
  - yeah taking light rail is clutch there  I found it very easy to get to places which is awesome
- - Do your genitals ever bruise  Has the motion of riding every caused you to climax or stimulated as such  More random thought watching people ride a horse ...
  - No  you get calluses on your inner thighs sometimes though . I m a girl so I do nt really know how balls would work .
  - Are the calluses like the ones you get on your hands 
  - Bloody  like the kinds you get after spending hours shoveling . They usually show up on the insides of the knees .
- - So how are you going to signal if you re carrying something big 
  - Personally  I signal with my feet and head if my hands are nt available . Looks a little dumb but people get the picture .
- - Black powder  That shit s low pressure . You re fine .
  - smokeless shells have nt blown it up yet
- - That was actually really scary to watch  I find the xenos so creepy when they re in small spaces like that ...
  - Before this would crack me up  but after a sesh of Alien . Isolation earlier today  this is just eerie .
- - It s only a matter of time until the flower mate will be discovered by other vaporents . I m glad I got it over the MFLB 
  - I have the MFLB  but boy what a difference the Flowermate does .
- - I do nt know but I ve been told Canadian pussy is mighty cold .
  - You ll be pleased to know it s the opposite . It s how we stay warm .
- - I m not a big fan of Yellowcard but I really enjoy that song .
  - Me neither but that is probably my favorite of theirs .
- - I ca nt wink my right eye . No story really  I just ca nt .
  - Same here . Can wink left eye easy .
- - Go to the state website and find the location of the rare bottle and buy it or have it sent to the local store near me .

- - I only want to see this happen if he answers all questions as Gaston .
  - I assume the pleasure would be all ours .
- - Survived direct contact with flame on top side . Currently in process of application .
  - Just because it survived out does nt mean it s safe  does it have a max temp rating 
- - But I hope you are not looking forward to death 
  - Let him look forward to whatever he wants
- - You shut your whore mouth . FS Megatron is a beast .
  - If you user him the whole time  he is an animal on D
- - Very cool  Where does she find the different pieces 
  - Goodwill stores  yard sales  flea markets  pretty much anywhere she can . edit . Grammar .
- - Also  it depends on which set of steps you take when going down to the subway . Every time I ve walked down the middle we ve lost .
  - You did nt happen to spend two seasons running up and down them did you 
- - you can coordinate fights on a private world . the hybridding community is very small .
  - Or you can go to a PvP world and find some randoms to hybrid against  so you do nt have to set up fights ...
- - These joker religious people need to find their camels and make the trip as their holy book says .
  - Totally  Let s promote ignorance and bigotry 
- - I do nt get it  why is it a boat 
  - It looks a little like a boat .
- - Damn  thought it was a joke at first cause it looked so discombobulated . The tops look awesome though .

- - He s got his visa and is now working on his green card 
  - Took me a second to get what you were saying . In was taking his answer a different way .
- - Could you explain the joke here  The joke is that Turkey thought they wo nt find it  but they found it 
  - It s about Turkey getting confused as an arab or muslim country . When terrorist attacks happen  people will always blame Turkey in some way
- - I actually am looking forward to the story seeing as Xenoverse for all intents and purposes is a retelling of Dragonball Online .
  - Ah  see  that s why I m not interested . Dragon Ball Online was so ... just ... well  awful .
- - Tw . A language I do nt think I have ever seen before .
  - It s Filipino . Source . Google translate . I also recognized it  because I have a friend who is from the Philippines and she uses it . Yep .
- - I may be wrong  but is nt there a setting where you can limit the frequency of calls like this you get  You can even set it to zero .
  - Ca nt set it to zero  maybe once an hour is the biggest span .
- - I m sorry but yeah  it s true . You re lucky you have nt been scarred like the rest of us
  - It ll happen to me gradually as well  no doubt .
- - Then you must have brought it upon yourself . If it s an accident I can see showing compassion  but stupidity is another thing . Hopefully you learned your lesson .
  - There were a lot of factors that contributed to my accident . Stupidity was one of them . I wish you well  friend .
- - Those are some of my favourite ever jerseys
  - Those are jerseys favorite some of my ever
- - Well  it did nt bug me too much  and I thought they probably was some explanation that I missed .
  - nah its cool man . Its a pretty cop out explanation
- - Yeah  you can search using pretty much any ISO symbol .
  - The thing here is that searching for asterisks not only searches for information in the songs but personal meta data as well . Somebody sat there and coded it in .
- - That s happened a few times  especially in the first season . They ve pretty much stopped that and I m not sure what it was supposed to mean .
  - First season zombies are nt canon . Does nt count .
- - Using Q-tips too much can seriously cause that sort of damage 
  - Your ear wax is natural anti-biotic and helps to keep bad stuff out .
- - How stained do you think the wood and tile will end up 
  - Probably the same colour of the ink . I do nt think you can clean that .
  - Alcohol usually does a good job getting ink up .
  - Huh . I suppose when you re good and trashed you do nt mind scrubbing longer 
- - Lose points for not knowing he s a Kiwi .
  - Oh really  I had no idea  sorry .
- - Long term - figuring things out and making myself happier . I know this is vague and broody  but it s the best I ve got . p
  - Nothing wrong with that . It s a noble mission 
- - All the runs are going to be recorded locally  encoded  and uploaded to youtube .
  - That s awesome  even better than automatic VODs 
- - What does this have to do with atheism 
  - Dude  his gay transgender autistic daughter drew that picture . Have some respect . It s okay to just admit you re wrong  you know .
- - It said Devin Hester  Chicago  but they updated it .
  - Wow  you caught a misprint  you must be so proud of yourself .
- - Where s everyone bitching about this  I do nt thnik I ve seen one .
  - Shhh  let the strawman burn and do nt ask questions .
- - I was always too afraid to cross the costume ladies while I was studying theatre .
  - We have a tendency to leave pins in the outfits of people who cross us .
- - lmao you really just used south park in an arguement
  - Why not  It s a decent barometer for popular culture in many ways .
- - Heck is where you go when you do nt believe in Jeez .
  - have all of the points i can give you 
- - You know you do nt have to reply to every comment in every post you make  right

  - How about we get everyone to tweet drake about it ... lets make it happen
- - I m going to go against the grain here and suggest that if this were to get touched up by a professional it could be half way decent .
  - Woot woot  get out of here you juggalo peace of trash .
- - Sticky bombs or longe range shot guns are my go-to .
  - I m kind of going on the more how to kill route  rather than the what to use . Shotgun and bombs is fairly obvious .
- - Dye your hair blonde and go Ezreal 
  - Ahh  I always get the ezreal response I ll link a blonde pic of myself as well
- - Oh right on . I have a pair in amber and now I wish I had gotten copper instead haha .
  - I ve recently gotten the copper over the amber one because of the amount of pull up the copper has . It ages really well .
- - What kind of discussion were you hoping to get here 
  - The same tired argument just gets old after eight thousand times  ya know
