  - We were promised that they were developing for PC and porting to consoles . They lied and did the opposite .
- - Adam seemed to like Teresa and she was far more broken and relatively less funny than Alison .

  - Which Frye s boot are you looking at 
- - Ill just have to disagree with you then . I take it you live in eastern ky 
  - Bourbon country . Still there is nothing southern about it . Just straight up rust belt and hillbilly . The grocery store does nt even sell grits that are nt instant

  - Thanks for clarifying that . I honestly believed you could .
- - Woah  Thanks for the extra info . Very happy that it did nt impact any of my other teeth 
  - Of course  What good is all the info I have floating around in my brain if I ca nt share it once in a while 
- - It sounds really stupid  but I do nt think he was trying to be homophobic  but was rather him trying to explain other people s thought process .
  - The bulk of homophobia comes from people who are nt trying to be homophobic .
- - I benefited greatly from it . Even today  decades removed  the ability to buckle down that was forced on me is of great use .
  - Same  it also felt good about the honesty that people gave me .
- - How do you know your testicle is twisted 
  - It is facing the opposite direction of the other testicle
- - There are records of people surviving falls from planes without parachutes . She could be ridiculously lucky and survive .
  - Those people do nt land on concrete . There s no way around this one . she would die horribly .
- - I enjoy Mirtle and Siegel although I would prefer if Mirtle had a little more upbeat or positive tweets every once in a while . Not everything has to be negative .
  - I agree  although if I do nt agree with his opinions he at least has the most integrity out of the Toronto sports writers in my opinion .
- - i get it  because its not her first drink 
  - Oh  THAT S the joke  Jesus ... I had thought the image had stopped loading .
- - how is mignolet became a shit . i just dont get it

  - It s crazy to think all that traffic is traveling through something so small .

- - Lol it skulls for me with emoji IOS
  - Those glowing eyes are a ribbon on the back of the hat .
- - There are lots of people I could nt imagine dating  but that does nt mean I think they re worse than Stalin .
  - I m not saying Cronus is worse than Gamzee  I m just saying he d give even worse relationship advice . At least Gamzee actually filled a couple of quadrants .
- - Depending on what school you re going to  you might have free options at your health clinic or whatever they offer . Just an idea .

  - Yes we need to see the comments 
- - Most people do nt judge lutherans by the actions of Westboro Baptist Church . I think the same rules should apply to all religions .
  - WBC does nt even do anything illegal . They re not terrorists .
- - No biggie . I ll just grab you a step ladder .
  - will you hold it for me  I would nt want to fall .
- - Unless the dog mauled him to death after he fell  which it did nt  it seems the cop was wrong .
  - You could contribute that to him shooting his weapon and the shot scared off the dog .
  - So then maybe instead of trying to shoot dogs from now on officers should try and shoot the ground in front of them to scare them off
  - That s a terrible idea  you never fire unless you re willing to destroy something . Warning shots are illegal in most states .
- - Since you seem to be so knowledgeable  please explain to me what those benefits to the US and it s citizens actually are . Thanks .
  - US citizens will be helping build the pipeline and will be working in refineries that use it . They will be paid . There s one benefit .

  - Same . But it was worth a shot  I guess .
- - You do nt want to know what they are .
  - Care to elaborate  Do you have an opinion or story to share 
- - But you know those companies fight those sorts of claims tooth and nail and will use every trick in the book to deny as much responsibility as possible .
  - As is their right . If they want to spend more money on a losing effort  so be it .
- - Some good points in there  but the author s anger cuts a pretty wide swath . Some deep breaths would have been good before posting .
  - He posted a follow-up today you should check out .
- - Oh lord  if that s a channel I know what I m doing tonight . Thank you 
  - I wish there were more of them actually . Shitlords need YouTube representation too

  - Haha I do nt think you realise how diverse a demographic bikies are . Dude you are the last person to be telling others to get in touch with reality .
- - I think the brand is sensible portions . They re very satisfying if you love chips  And you get a pretty sizeable serving compared to other chips .
  - Awesome  I ll keep an eye out for them while I m at the store .
- - I m going to try to be kinder to myself this year . And maybe actually gather the emotional strength to make an appointment for a therapist .

  - i audibly sighed when i saw it too  but mainly because i knew OP had been ripped off .
- - I know a couple of native Welsh speakers who s grasp of English is fairly poor . Should they not live in Britain 
  - Is this true  It s fascinating to think there are still native Brits here who do nt speak English . Pretty cool .
- - I really wish it had the normal health system and first person spectator mode  hopefully it will in the full game 
  - I do nt think it would be better with normal shields . Getting shots on someone and not killing them in this fast paced game mode would ruin the fun .
- - I read on forums where more than a few people said that it does .
  - Always verify for yourself before taking action .
- - Why is it that salted peanuts taste so much better than unsalted peanuts with salt added from a salt shaker

- - Would you like to make a trade  I currently have military schooling that could be very useful to you .
  - Yes I am sure some students from the Army Academy would be interested in a foreign exchange .
- - And people will ride themselves into the ground for it .
  - And fans will pay big money for the replica sticker .
- - Taj just got worked by Harden off the dribble .
  - When a possible MVP guard is being defended by a power forward  even one as quick and long as Taj  he is going to get a good shot .
- - Could nt he just gently tackle it 
  - He d probably hurt himself pretty badly trying to do that
- - Good . Sounded a lot louder than it normally does . If only we could have crowds like that at every home game .
  - And people that understand when to be loud and when not to .
- - I had no idea Lou Amundson was still in the NBA .
  - He was getting some minutes in Cleveland  not many  due to the whole bigs situation there .
- - Write the words Be excellent to each other  into google translate and go through every single language possible . That would be sure to fix all the world s problems .
  - yeah  but they would nt listen .
- - even waiting in a tree stand or blind sucks  at least it takes patience .
  - I did nt mean to exclude that  That is exactly it  It really sucks that the people that are hunting legally have to put up with these assholes .
- - This looks like an abandon sign  which hopefully means the public majority will not see this .
  - If it s abandoned  is it really vandalism

- - the new mythoclast basically  the raid exotic
  - How can u compare the mytho to something that doesnt even exist yet .
- - Thank god we did nt  decent player but we d have probably lost him for like a month now .
  - We lost Debuchy for a while too you know
- - But the minute I start trying to scroll with two fingers  I ca nt if I m resting my thumb at the bottom .
  - That works for me  I can scroll with two fingers and it ll filter out the thumb at the bottom .
- - For the record  only heavy classes can use hammers .
  - thanks  had no idea . That should make things simpler
- - If both people are on the same page ... it s less shitty ... but still not exactly respectful of one another .
  - Ugh . Do nt be so sex-negative . People still have the right to do what they want with their own bodies  you should not judge them like that .
- - Australia is nt that hot  Canada is nt that cold ...
  - I m curious which countries you would choose to describe as hot and cold .

  - Depends where you live . Rural area at Lake Constance  at least half of the players go by car .

- - Most definitely I was just adding that in there as a priority to get set straight .
  - yeah and i hope this is on the priority list right on top
- - The most rigged shit I ve ever seen
  - Not even a Lions fan and I agree with this
- - ursa MoM  which i feel is even more viable now with the changes
  - Cool  I ll have to try that . I usually build helm of the dominator into satanic .
- - That bottom picture of the tree looks kind of cool .
  - I like that one  it s so quaint  yet so badass  living in a dragon skeleton and all .
- - That s some sitcom level ouch right there  lol
  - Yeah  that lack of proof reading hurt my sides .
- - Someone should claim all of them and put them on a line so everyone would be as confused as I am right now with these names .
  - RIP to the play-by-play guy if they make a tic-tac-toe play .
- - Why would you click on it then 
  - I did nt . The very idea creeped me out .
- - If you want to stop masturbating why dont you try to find a sexual partner 
  - Really  This is a gamer we are talking about .

- - If I get one I ll do that hahah

- - No  how did I incorrectly use the definition of rhetoric I POSTED 
  - he s too smart and has given up on you . Read the book if you want to improve .
- - Got ta be a troll account right  Surely 
  - I think he s trying to be funny .
- - I agree with the other poster about blending  Try using a transition shade in between the crease colour and your brows and maybe using less shadow in the crease .
  - Okay thank you for the advice . I am new to blending and using much eyeshadow really 
- - Did you get a finished pic of the Talos x tank track fellow uploaded  Would love to see . D
  - hey hey  Sorry for the late reply . He s still unpainted  I ve been distracted by some Terminators lately

  - Be there - done that . Never helped .
- - Why are your policies different from the Republic party only in where authoritarianism is appropriate and where it is not 
  - This is basically the same question I planned on asking  just worded a little differently . I ll probably go with this

  - Yes and it also makes me a hungry person .
- - Looks like someone slammed a car door on it
  - At first glance I thought it was snapped .

- - There s so little snow up there now  hopefully it is nt fully rained out by the end of the week .
  - It s depressing . It rained for three days  everywhere  even on the summit of the East s highest peak .
- - And the winner is determined by score rather than being the last survivor .
  - Why time mode is continually used as the standard when most players period do nt even play it is mind-boggling .
- - You got this  Get out there  and kick this years ass 
  - maybe after my body stops hurting  thanks i will i never give up 
- - Using pinterest for recipes is genius  wow  I do nt know why I never thought of that  I just have an overly elaborate bookmarks folder .
  - Oh yeah it s one of the main reasons I use it .
- - Manly hands on a little boy  Sounds like when my little league coach used go give me a ride home from practice in his van .
  - Everyone line up so I can size your cup .

  - How do you open the door to get into the restaurant 
- - Sorry for the Naive question  but is the royal family considered to be above the law in the UK  Does it even matter if he is guilty or not 
  - They are nt above the law  but they get treated differently .
- - It ; s just a fantasy camp for him
  - It s also like five miles from where he grew up .
- - Would be better without the people in it . They are both in awkward positions .
  - agreed  not flattering in any way .
- - True . Fuck you we will murder you at SB .

- - Not diggin that front bumper one bit .
  - I agree and personally I think the tires are stretched too much .

  - Yeah . But whatever not my car . Excited to see where they go with it .
- - a new game  Try installing the perma patch without the Merge patch and bashed patch .
  - Already tried that on the old install . Still have more mods to set up on this fresh install before I install PerMa but I m hoping it goes smoothly .
