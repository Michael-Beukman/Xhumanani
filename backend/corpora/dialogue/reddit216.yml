  - Ya  they have nt changed their style in decades .

- - My wife saw this last night  and is now convinced we should foster baby pitbulls . And I want one . This might cause some jealousy with my corgi .

- - That s good  because he looks really  really sad . You just want to pick him up and cuddle him and hug him until everything s all right again .
  - That happens a ton in the house  no worries .
- - I personally would nt bother with village upgrades early on  since this village gets raided always  it s hardly worth it . Better to invest your money in enterprises
  - I was just summarizing the video . I agree with you . A village isnt really a money source it is just a step in becoming a vassal .
- - I cringe at how those stems are stored .
  - Actually those are going out for repairs . The working ones are in the lounge .
- - You can still report what that relative did to you  if you want to you should go to the police about it .
  - Yeah I think about it but it was ages ago . I can see it not ending well with family .

  - I have nt even got any connected  I ca nt even get to boot or BIOS screen so I ca nt see how that could be influencing it .
- - I wo nt be waiting  though . Plus I do nt want to retake the ASVAB . My score was decent  just not good enough for Nuke .
  - Was it good enough for subs  A tech rate 
- - They re all in white blue red order . Then the black one shows up and ruins it .
  - I ... I ca nt believe it was that obvious

  - Soon we ll just listen to three minute songs about soft drinks .
- - wonder what valve was thinking when they came up with the stained pattern idea it looks so bad lmao
  - I think they were like hmm we need some bad patterns to balance the prices between fade crimson web and the bad patterns  well let s make a ebola pattern
- - I ve honestly never considered that . It makes my vision of the distant future a lot more positive 
  - Until you consider how easily weaponized that could be  or the possibility of having your body hacked  while you re off in virtual reality .
- - I just uploaded one too  Would you like to rate it with your honest opinion 
  - Will do  Im sorry I just noticed this now  Let me go check

  - Like the bottom of the stands is higher than the field aka there s a brick wall surrounding the field
- - Hmm answer me this question  are you doing it for yourself or to get attention from the ladies 
  - A bit of both  i d say .
- - Where else can I find this godlike art . I loved THor . GoT  need my fix .
  - Jonathan Hickman s run on The Ultimates .
- - But at least Monochrome has the shock value of pairing Weiss with a Faunus .
  - But shock value can only last so long .
- - I mean like physically turn one of the corners without turning any side of the cube
  - Yes  but most people would nt really consider that a valid move .
- - How does starting the fucking event two days after New Year s Eve make sense 
  - That s basically what I thought  too .
- - It is the farthest away from town  so often it s more practical to go pretty much anywhere else .
  - Ok great  thank goodness I have an excuse to go somewhere else .
- - WOW . I am truly lost for words now .
  - Why could nt we play either of these teams 
- - okay is this Japanese version because i got one when it came out back in the day and it did nt have the sword

- - This is the stuff we notice too ... What incompetent shit are they doing that we do nt see 
  - after working at cvs for a year processing prescriptions ... i really dont wan na think about that
- - They have though . People in the vocal minority will always complain  but I do nt see them successfully developing and maintaining their own MOBA .
  - That s a pretty silly argument . Should i stop complaining about politicians until i win my own seat and run a successful district 
- - Wait  what does Chris Christie have to do with Dallas 
  - You did nt see him humping Jones after the Cowboys win 
- - That s almost as bad as when I was in highschool and the guy next to me accidentally put his hand in my crotch and started giving me a hand job .

  - I like it like that  seems to me that the doorway is flush but the door itself is recessed - assume you laced the door from the outside  right 
- - I think so . The good thing about undercuts is that they look good with almost any head shape .
  - I wish i could use photoshop to see before i do it
- - Pretty piss poor fight . Sums up all the fights tonight to be honest  just nothing amazing about any of them . Sigh .
  - I agree it was a huge bore fest .

- - Why are you identifying with Ottomans as an Indian 
  - I identify with Ottomans because I am Muslim .
- - Increasing TTK makes the mobility of the game too good . The only way things like thruster work is with a fast TTK .
  - Agreed  The reduced TTK is the exact balance to combat the new agility and abilities Spartans have .
- - Saga . Been recently discussed how is would fare as a Telltale game  which in my opinion would be amazingly fitting .
  - How s that  All dialogue  no puzzles  fucked up saves between episodes  Edit . No  seriously  how  tell me .

- - can somebody tell me how playoff overtime works 
  - If no winner is determined after one quarter of OT  two man sack races are held from midfield to the end zone until a clear winner emerges .
- - Well to be fair he had major health concerns . New Orleans  Miami  and San Diego were the only teams that showed any interest in him .
  - Lets not dwell in what could have been .

  - It s tough as nails to win in Foxborough .
- - Tks - I just got that Protean update - somehow I got the Libstatusbar update first without the newest Protean . Just installed and all is good
  - I do nt see an update to libstatusbar .
- - Not just any comatose patient  his brain-dead identical twin . Just do nt ask why he s still in a wheelchair .
  - Cause he is an old lazy man in a body that never had to walk and therefore not have developed muscles .
- - That s been one of my big concerns is the upkeep costs on the higher ships .
  - there was a FD forum post  posted here about . We ll look into maintenance costs for high tier ships

  - Ai nt your job  Missy  Or does Mr. J have that covered 
  - Eh  it s a free country .
- - Ooh nice list . The NBP one is especially great cause some random NBP members showing up and passing out flyers CLEARLY means Sharpton hired them himself .
  - I could honestly care less about a pathetic racist and nationalist group like the NBP . They re the lesser of the evils here
- - If I was in your situation  I would have got a WRX or ST .
  - I might be shopping for an WRX if they still sold a hatch .

- - Am I missing something or is this literally the most fucking broken thing in all of Dota  Like you get a rapier and aghs and it s gg right there
  - Theorycrafting at its finest . Consider other options too .

  - In Fez s defense  he is probably steering the ship .
- - That last one on the slicer could have ended very poorly
  - Agreed . I would not have scared him around that machine .
- - This has been known for like four months .
  - But this time  Bleacher Report is saying it .
  - Yeah  before only WWE.com itself was saying it  Now that Bleacher Report is saying it it s official 
  - Remember to follow the author on Twitter for more sick scoops .
- - Better nutrition  strength training  coaching  shoes . I would agree .
  - I mean it s pretty obvious . We just have way more than they did .
- - Women being comfortable and genuinely having fun while naked is the hottest thing there is for me .
  - this . I want one of these so bad ...
- - Gross  I feel like I need to change things now . I m using the most popular everything .
  - GNOME is nt hipster enough for you 
- - If you were the most fearsome predator on the North American continent you could sit around and look silly too . Maybe any continent .
  - I think polar bears might take that title . Even wolves are close to the good ole brown bear .
- - Well  Whiterun s jarl and Ulfric are nt in good terms  remember  LOL
  - Ohhh  right lol  I guess I have to move somewhere else then haha
- - I have had no issues with my Dual link DVI . I have heard the single input ones overclock better and have less input lag .
  - Okay so go for the single input one

  - Or not a single report was given that day ... I ll see myself to the door .
- - Fuck . Why ca nt the world just get the fuck along 
  - The world is pretty big . I d be happy with a few of the trailer parks in my area getting along .
- - If you are going north  Tackle Tom s in Cascade always has a good selection and is a good local business .

- - Move to Japan and get rich making hentai
  - And selling the rest of this medicine bottle millions or billions dollars .
- - I m just glad this sub remains tried and true .
  - I stopped visiting the other one a few weeks ago . They appease the beasts over there way too much .
- - Why do people customize anything or even have preferences at all 
  - This has more to do with baller status than it is about customizing their cars .
- - Fun fact . PC version has no in-game VoIP or chat  thus making any sort of communication impossible .

  - I am literally unable to even right now .
- - Not entirely  having trouble learning . Somewhat difficult finding good resources .
  - Aw . I would direct you to Scott Manley  but you ve probably heard that before .
- - Star Wars ... derivative crap stolen from Akira Kurosawa s movies
  - I enjoy it as a summer blockbuster film . I hate the people who try to instill a deeper philosophy into those movies  because it just is nt there .

  - I ve had to reload when I pick something up at the wrong time and dialog starts automatically . I keep making that same mistake 
- - And way to ruin chances of her posting more
  - She s not naked . He s not ruining anything . You think someone recognizing a girl in full dress will stop her  Cmon man
- - Does nt moving within range of an enemy automatically aggro it again 
  - He goes to attack its enemy once it lands to the ground .
- - My parents are also first cousins . Explaining family relations is complicated  but I do nt have any health or mental issues  nor do my kids .

- - Like he s making anything with hundred views YT videos .
  - and  It s still his content .
- - Yeah pretty much . That looks pretty interesting
  - Yea  I just finished it . It s good  but it feels way too short currently . It needs a year or two to really accumulate issues .
- - Yes it s definitely the white mans fault that blacks prey on themselves and ruin their communities .
  - I m glad that s all you took away . Feeling superior because you re in a marginally better position
- - Employment with a steady income that is nt a day to day grind
  - The job is retouching and editing John Goodman s selfie scat porn .
- - You get upset at people asking who s there over an intercom  Talk about touchy . You realize some people have more than just pizza guys come to their door .
  - To be fair  it s a very attractive door .
- - Man it s just seems like Alabama is nt even trying . They just look so flat .
  - Still saying that  I hate when people assume the players are nt trying . I mean we do nt know .
- - I smell blood in the air . How foolish of me just last week i was thinking maybe this year world would not be such a fucked up place .
  - Welcome to the real world . Again .

  - Its already very widely known how good it is  I do nt see them nerfing it anytime soon .
- - That hit on the kicker was dirty as shit .
  - in what way  he did nt lead with the helmet or go helmet to helmet
- - couldnt he just buy all the drugs for the highest price and slowly wean the supply  I bet I m oversimplifying
  - He presumably understands that even if you eliminate the supply of something  that does nt eliminate the demand for it . Human nature is not simply fixed with money .
- - I think you ll be back  if not regularly .
  - I already said I d still comment here occasionally myself .
- - I hope she becomes Blondie the Fired .

- - Is that a good thing or are we just going to get worse at scouting late round picks 
  - He has a proven track record so it might be good . It s also good to see that the organization is identifying issues and addressing them .

- - Wow . Finally some good music will be at this festival  Hope that means another summer tour  as the MISSED my area completely this past summer .
  - Me too ... I hope the hit Beacon theater again 
- - You need a couple of more periods in there . Also  Locke was never an ODST  he was an ONI spook .

- - This would be much better without the hat imo . Otherwise I like this fit a lot man
  - I agree  lose the hat and this fit is fuego

  - i feel like it had to be more harsh than that .
  - Mona tells us what she said when they re in the bathroom .
  - Really  hmm guess I missed that . Ca nt believe that made her that upset . lol
- - Yeah  she s a nice person . Maybe the stores do nt mind her super couponing because she s polite and does nt snap at people for doing their jobs 
  - I m sure upper management loves her  she helps them move product off of the shelves . Pretty important in a very competitive business with low margins .
- - Ugh . Because spanking totally solves everything 
  - Well how can you raise your children without them fearing you  How ever will they obey you lol .
- - How can you sell players cheap to a specific person 
  - You really ca nt slightly under market value only to be honest .
  - Ohh that s what I will thinking because yeah snipers .
  - Sniping is great when you are doing it  but otherwise nah .
- - Great eye width and eyebrows . Top tier  in fact . Not sure about the other facial features though  I ll let others decide .
  - Always thought my brows were bad . Thanks for the feedback .
- - We have tons of guilty people who are guilty who are found not guilty . Way more than those who are not guilty and jailed .
  - The ones who are not guilty are held in jail until proven not guilty right  Depending on the crime of course .

- - No wax on that board bruh  dead give away .
  - nah man  the ladies are waxed ...

- - Was the last play really necessary lol .
  - We re all laughing  so yes lol
- - I do nt think it s spyware when they only do what they say they re doing when you install it .
  - No one reads the fine details  and it s wrong of them to do so .

  - It s free to transfer money in and out of a normal TD Ameritrade account .
- - Trying to figure out what to do for dinner . I m fuckin  hungry and this crazy woman ca nt make her mind up .
  - Literally just finished eating a curry . Enjoy whatever you have 
- - No  he does nt . He belittles people who try to force the belief in God on others while denying science . Big difference .
  - No he belittles people . You could hear how he was speaking in Cosmos . God forbid someone else has a different belief system .
- - If you overdo it then you re essentially abusing your body . Your body then rebels on you by making you spew vomit among other symptoms .
  - Is the whole shaking around a bunch part of it too 
- - I ve met like five people tops in my entire life in here who have heard the second verse of the anthem .
  - Now you ve met  like  six .

- - I WANT TO FROLIC THROUGH THAT FIELD .
  - Tip toe  through the the tulips ...
- - Haha . When you get into business with the devil you re asking for trouble . Mendes does hold the cards here .

  - Lol  that makes sense . Reasons I m not a programmer .
- - The most important Saving Throw is the one you fail to make .
  - The most important Saving Throw is the one that kills the party .
- - There are plenty of Cassandra lovers here  You will be among good company .
  - She is so awkwardly cute  it made it nearly impossible for me not to romance her .
- - Not much . It s an AR . Please  take your finger off the trigger .
  - At least it s pointing down range . p
- - In your screen shot  the toolbox icon is in the top right - I do nt think you have all the extensions disabled .
