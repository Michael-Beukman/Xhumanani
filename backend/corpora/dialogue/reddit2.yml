  - Australia do nt do so well when shutting up shop . They usually get a break in which goes on to trash the joint .
- - Is that legal to pull his arm and drag him away like that 
  - Me and my Dad were wondering that . Both teams did it too .

- - True  but conceptually  this is what he wants . Left outer with a null check would also do the trick .
  - Yeah  it does to that the trick . worrying about performance is still out of my range as i am just starting to learn sql .
- - Reminds me to when we heard he d be back for champions league
  - i think they rushed him for champions league
  - Do nt see how . His latest injury had nothing to do with the previous injury if I m not mistaken

  - Vikings fans should hate the Packers a lot more than the Cowboys . When s the last time the Cowboys dashed their playoff hopes 
  - Packers and Vikings are nt really rivals . The Vikings are more of a retirement home for our old talent .
  - Enjoy your success now because as the tide turns back towards the Vikings I will bask in your tears .

- - Still fuckin stupid gesture by someone in trouble for selling autographs .
  - They were doing it long before the autograph story broke .

  - If someone tries to kill you . You kill em right back

  - wha ...  did I say anything about Jay  I DID  oh ... hmm ... seems you re seeing something that s not there ...
- - Well  I consider adding new bugs to cancel out any fixes  so the game s state of instability lies at an equilibrium .
  - Oh equilibrium  how well you play with Nekros .
- - Sniped  Try again or we can direct trade .
  - It was XD . Alright  I added your FC .
- - We need Templars to take care of the apostates . You would get this joke if you have played Dragon Age .
  - Or  you know  read history .
- - Only Oregon fans want to watch the rest of this game . Can we switch to NOLA now

  - Good luck  Let me know how it works for you .
- - you may be off base on this one

  - I have found similar ones in most smoke shops .
- - I d say eBay is your best bet . What color were you looking for  Brown or red 
  - im looking for any color  i just love the back design so much
- - Here it s speech pathology  but you have to talk around those girls  social consciences . I d rather date someone working in marketing . Or really just working .
  - I dated a couple of those . They were really angry people .
- - Do nt believe you . Texas gave birth to prohibition and they hate Mexicans .
  - I m a Texan that does nt hate Mexicans
- - watching people think MCC will be put on PC is hilarious
  - Watching people who give vague responses because they ca nt argue is hilarious .
- - Should have put it inside the washing machine
  - Thought about it  then thought better of it .

- - Whoop  Same here  Dont like racing games but loved everything about this game 
  - Right    Its crazy how good it is .
- - Aaaaand you just made sports really sad . Whatever floats your boat 
  - It s a business . To be honest  I m far more interested in the business of sports than in sports themselves ... other than hockey .
- - How can you know without a doubt  It is impossible for anyone to know without a doubt  unless they were there .
  - i hope you re on my jury if i m ever accused of something
- - Awesome lineup all around . I was hoping Zhu would be on there tho
  - I feel like he could be a late add  it happens .
- - Fair enough  might go to a different CL team though
  - He actually just confirmed he s going to the MLS
  - So ... On loan to a PL team for the whole of next season 
  - do everton have links with any us teams 
- - does anyone have a real answer as to why NA online matches ALWAYS start so late  its only NA matches that are online that do this
  - No discipline because they have no punishment if they do so .
- - What the fuck was wrong with The Hobbit trilogy 
  - The last one was filled out with really tedious fight scenes . Could have been improved by editing down to about half an hour .
- - There used to be a portal entrance there  given the sign above the wall .
  - Clearly OP is not thinking with Portals .
- - Writers should nt be selecting who goes anyways . It s a joke .
  - Thank you . A bunch of journalists and writers who have hardly ever thrown a ball decide who gets in . Always seemed odd to me .
- - Me thinks the Seals should start screening for character  not just for random chumps who can pass hell week
  - Somebody said this before and then said they do it s a test on who can make up the best characters for the next seals book release .
- - Yeah see the edit . No faith shame on me .
  - It went down from there anyways  haha
- - I m not sure I understand ... but I want one . EDIT . SIXTY FREAKIN DOLLARS  WHAT THE SHIT .
  - Yeah  it is spendy because of the soft vinyl they are going to use . It is pretty much the same thing as all those other fancy Japanese vinyl toys .
- - I would unfollow tbone for being such a douche today but those pics he tweets ...
  - you do realize the internet is literally filled with endless pages of free porn 
- - Pepsi co. has the means of actually bringing us something from that film that can exist and they have nt even bothered to try  worst marketing move ever 
  - A worse marketing move would be spending millions on impractical bottles that tip over in a slight breeze .
- - Then people would whine how he did nt apologize because for all they know he did nt
  - Not to mention he reached out to do a private apology but moore refused to meet with him .
- - Kind of invalidates their entire argument does nt it 
  - The marriage part of the argument yes .
- - are you going to keep it NL or would you be willing to depart from it at the end of the ladder 
  - If i m right it s for his NL chanter . P
- - Almost Human . Stupid Fox did it again .
  - WHAT WAS OVER THE WALL      
- - the pineapple habanero and garlic aioli sauce from costco are really good .
  - With the intense calories packed in those sauces you may as well be eating take-out . Tasty though .
- - BACON . You do nt make it you are granted it by divine providence .
  - mm bacon  first one to say this oddly o.O i thought bacon was the almighty food xD
- - When talking about the better player in this sub it almost always comes down to physical attraction
  - LOL Please expand on your theory  and tell us which NBA players you find the dreamiest so we can put together a list of MVP candidates .
- - It s probably a good idea . Likely impossible to pin anything on you .
  - That is not true at all  LE is nt stupid .
  - They do nt need to be stupid  they need to PROVE that it was intended for you .
  - And they will because they are not stupid .
- - Wow  Clone Wars on Netflix is available in Spanish . I ve been meaning to watch it . Great find 
  - Yeah  it strikes a pretty good balance between being easy to understand  but also not just a kid s show . They also have subtitles in ingles and espanol .
- - I ll get u prices and exact links to them in a few hours so u can decide which ones u want
  - If you re not going to be posting them here  I d appreciate if you PM d me as well .
- - Does Williamson still have a couple overs every now and then  He used to have a real knack for picking up wickets . Especially when not much is happening .
  - Maybe he is all about the batting now . They do keep saying how much time he puts in in the nets  might be a little rusty with the ball .
- - Sorry guys David Blatt is not a good coach
  - more like aj price  shawn marion  matthew dellavadova and joe harris are not good players . what do you want the man to do
- - Sweet  glad you added the watermark so people do nt steal it 
  - I highly doubt it ll stop anybody in this age  but it s worth a shot .
- - Yawn . Let me know when their functioning service area exceeds grande s .
  - Loved my Grande  now with TW  Google Fiber soon  but not soon enough .
- - Great fight . Gon na be so technical . Could be Machida split decision .
  - Technically a split decision shows a discrepancy in scoring criteria among judges and should never happen . I get what you re saying though it should be a close fight .
- - THIS STORY IS EVEN MORE AMAZING BECAUSE NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THE TWELVE GUESTS MADE SO MUCH AS A PEEP THE ENTIRE TIME
  - It . Was . A. Suprise . Party 
- - Even the Zapruder film has more clarity than this .
  - Lets give OP a chance to prove he s not Michael J . Fox .
- - On some satellite and cable services we can . Oddly  my provider broadcasts a Chicago station  including their local news . It s very odd really .
  - Wow . Glad to know it goes both ways then .
- - I once listened to electronic music  and now I m stuck in the internet .
  - I listened to alternative music now nobody wants me
- - Does it finish extremely quickly  As in  in seconds 
  - it finished in less than a minute  yes . I found that kind of weird since the first time I did nt run with a minimal order .
- - What if a time gap happens  I know I have no evidence but you never know .
  - Personally  I d love to hear David Hayter in TPP ...
- - Did you listen to his Harris episode  Did you know all that shit about Harris  One of the craziest podcasts I ve ever heard .
  - Speaking of which I NEED MORE FOAM CORNER .
- - How did it seem like she was drawing blood  I must have missed something then because i do nt recall this .
  - in Radley she took Hanna s tweezers and dug in her own finger
- - I would still need some sort of DAC too  right 
  - Not really . Once you input to the receiver digitally it has its own dac s that decipher everything .
- - If you move first and pick a corner  you will only ever win or tie .
  - no thats how you throw against your defense .
- - Studying abroad in Ireland starting Friday . How I am going to miss Mexican food from here in California ...
  - Especially if you re from out in SD . Grim stuff out here  my friend  although Guinness stew is pretty tasty .
- - Looks are more important than personality when finding a partner .
  - Maybe for some people but if I would nt enjoy being with someone outside of their appearance then I would nt be able to stand them .
- - They are normal in the sense that they are within the allowable limits .
  - That is a strange definition of normal .
  - But we know his actual T levels were low to normal so there is nothing to mask ...
  - No  we do nt know that . Where are you seeing that reported 
  - Yes we do - it s on the exact same test results sheets as his TE ratio ...
  - That was from a urine sample  which is not a good way to measure the total amounts .
- - I dunno  what s not taken  Should we have an ongoing list or something 
  - If you check the original post  it s been in there
- - Then what about the whole part about God not letting the Prophet lead the people astray  Even with stories of God literally smiting them if it ever happened .
  - Well  if you re assuming God will let prophets say crap  you can say that specific arrogant and stupid quote was one of those instances ...
- - I am by no means wishing any success for Bama  but everyone here is acting like this is a done deal . This game is faaaaar from over .
  - So true dude  ca nt wait to see how this plays out
- - How happy are you to no longer have to worry about money since she takes care of it 
  - She does nt . Not all couples are the same .
- - Still there  Trade with you now if you hop on ... . D
  - I m back  I added you and am online now .
- - I really hope that Curtis Axel becomes the new X-Pac . The benchmark guy who can work with a load of different styles and can be used to assess other guys .
  - And one day tears his butthole in the ring 
- - Because when that shitty game was released literally unplayable and it s difficult to get a refund as soon as possible it becomes a problem .
  - If someone is dumb enough to buy this then ...
- - First picture is important  the fact your eyes are closed is nt helping . The photo of you at the wedding is much better .
  - I was going to lead with it but I look nothing like that in the others . But I guess first impressions mean the most .
- - Embarrassed that I did nt realize this comment was in jest until I saw this gif . Whoops .
  - Seriously though  great job . I just could nt resist
- - I have the pills with powder inside . You re saying I should open the pills and drop the powder into my tongue 
  - Could be worth a try . I bought a tub of pure powder . That s how I take mine .
- - Diesel is flammable . It s just not as explosive . I grew up on a farm in nebraska lol
  - I do nt see how that changes anything from a historical perspective
- - I enabled UPNP in XBMC and use BubbleUPNP on android to listen to music and watch videos .
  - I did this when Plex was nt encoding correctly . Also VLC works for DLNA .
- - I m not arguing politics  I m arguing etymology .
  - Fine  but you ve only proven that the word has been associated with leftist politics since its inception and using it to describe classical liberalism is a modern innovation .
- - Wearing my Kyrie ASG jersey  hoping he ll duplicate the performance
  - With our combined luck he ll be unstoppable 
- - I ll never understand why people like the induction sound . Its all about the exhaust note for me .
  - While I agree with you  a really killer induction sound along with the exhaust note makes it so much better . Actually listening to her breathe .
- - Maybe Thomas just said he wanted to finger Jesus s hole and the other disciples assumed incorrectly about his intent .
  - Is that what they mean when they say you ca nt enter heaven unless Jesus enters you  O.o
  - I hope to see that line in a porn someday .
  - I d be surprised if it has nt already been used in a porno . Certainly it must have been used by at least one Catholic priest .

  - okay - back to sketching ... thanks everyone 
- - Sorry for double posting the pictures . I guess I do nt know how imgur works .
  - Seeing the first picture for the second time cracked me up . It s all good 
- - Wyatt vs ambrose was heavily promoted but not featured here . Sounds about right
  - Tbh their feud is boring and helped none of them .
- - Yeah ... the fact you can list your life accomplishments on one hand means you re still young bud .
  - He s an adult . Get over it
- - Ah ok . It just looked like he did nt have a grasp of the game mechanics like the supers and such
  - I definitely did nt  yeah . lol - got slightly better as each chapter went on though .
- - I have actually seen individuals combat this issue by wearing multiple layers of underwear .
  - That ... I just have to see 
- - Somebody would notice and then they d hold a funeral .
  - Well is nt that nice for you 
- - what areas are these red players active in  I m not sure if I ve ran into them
  - You just have to keep an eye out for ENL and RES players who seem to be riding in the same car  often it s one player playing two accounts .
  - oh I see . that type of cross faction play . I have seen that in Plano .
  - I did nt know this was a thing in DFW  but that explains some stuff that s happened around here .
- - hmm it ll be interesting to see where Gerrard fits into our starting XI
  - Keep Lampard for next season and play them together in midfield  simple .
  - Might as well offload Tour and Silva our way now that they re surplus to requirements .
  - Loan them to NYCFC or Melbourne City maybe  Keeps em on reserve just in case .
- - I have them all  but i will take a while to get home to trade .
  - One or two would be great thank you  I do nt expect you to give me all of them haha .
  - It s okay . You can choose any of them
  - Thank you mate . Someone was kind enough to give me most of them  but I d really appreciate it if you had a spare Turtwig lying around .
- - You can get Seche Vite Restore  add a few drops to the polish and it thins it right up  making it as good as new 
  - Cool  I ll check it out 
- - I started Infinite Jest . Wish me luck
  - That is a brutal way to start the challenge . Good luck to you .
- - Wow that s really long  Cool though .
  - Could be the same as you though . It is a hard angle to show it from . Also I was hard so that makes a diffrence
- - It was skyrim for me . Except I did nt have to tell friends or family anything because non of them care about me .
  - Hey it s my brother from another mother .
- - Back to mediocrity we go ... whoop de doo 
  - I dunno ... He did nt do well in Houston  but his offense in Baltimore has been great in comparison to last year s Ravens offense . I m split .
- - Haha someone is using an old DELL monitor XD
  - So what  They probably just ca nt afford a good one . They still should be treated like any PC gamer .
- - TIL how to get paid twice for developing a chemical weapon .
  - Or how to get paid for pretending to develop one .
- - nothing like a bit of carbon on carbon action jeez ... did nt think the wing would destroy the suspension like that ... but guess it makes sense .
  - Well the front wheels are basically attached by a couple of spider legs ...
- - Now if only my musical taste was in line with the hipsters in this sub .
  - Well the hipsters are the ones submitting songs every day . Submit something different 
- - Nothing at McDonald s would cause this to happen .
  - No power in heaven or hell could make this happen .
- - Whelp  fuck this  you ve convinced me not to buy from Microsoft .
  - Nothing like cake day revelations . Sadly  it s near impossible NOT to buy anything from them for gamers .
- - In my personal opinion it s more important not to have a disparity in the relationship than the number only you re providing .
  - I feel as though my income will be a problem regardless .
- - Do the cracks actually prevent normal usage at all 
  - I m guessing it pinches the arm  causing annoyance and pain 
  - Is there a way to fix that  I small hairline fractures
  - I m guessing you ll have to send it for a warranty claim
- - Wait when did they decide not to be virtualized 
  - Plastic Beach Tour . During Demon Days shows Damon would step out into the foreground to perform Hong Kong during the encore .
- - So they last minute decided to load the ceiling with confetti 
  - They more than likely already had the confetti in the original script and just worked it into the new one
- - dont remind me sir my doge wallet was one day late for the clam distro so i got none
  - The liar plays the sympathy card again  Cmon man .
- - Torrey should have had that second touchdown . Should have been dragging his feet .
  - I thought that too . He should ve made that play
- - Maybe you got really drunk and made some AMAZING trade  and just do nt remember it 
  - I ve had this happen . Never found that route again .
- - Hey Piper  they re playing your song 
  - She went nuts  Growling at the tv hahaha
- - For your mage deck  is a second Mountain Giant an acceptable replacement for Alex  That s the only card I m currently missing .
  - Pretty sure she s hard to replace  you want to use her after your Giants come out .
- - Are you sure  I have nt gotten one .
  - Well the admins announced it -- maybe it has nt actually been rolled out yet
- - I eat milo powder . Is that bad  I do nt care . It s delicious .
  - I do that too . In fact when I buy Milo  all I do is eat it .
- - I feel like if the US did this it would incite riots .
  - I feel like we re all too frightened and addicted to convenience to riot about anything .
- - Honestly  the sound of big city like New York City at night with a little bit of wind on a cool and chilly October night . Ahh such bliss ...
  - Definitely . I do nt understand how people ca nt sleep to that . It s a heavenly noise .
- - Added the xml file and still wont work
  - Sorry mate  but you ve done something wrong then . That s how it s done . Attach your file if you like and I ll take a look
- - Baby oil by FAR  dissolves anything and everything I can throw at it in mere seconds with quite minimal effort .
  - Agreed  And it s so gentle .
- - So tell me . Was it the sentence  Because I did nt know what I was doing  Picking Duncan 
  - It was something you said but not today and not here . Think back .
  - Is it because im doing multiple subs 
  - Close ... so close but still not there .
- - Ishmael gets INTs though . We need him in the passing lanes .
  - This . He led our team in picks . With a better pass rush and a better defense  we want to keep Ishmael back there to get us the INTs .
- - Manning leaves his guys out to dry on a regular basis .
  - Thats because he no longer has the arm strength . So the ball stays in the air longer giving the defense more time to make the play .
- - Anyone know where we can get a backup goalie 
  - If we knew we d get a better one too
- - The Tamanna palette is still available at Macy s . c .
  - Did you see it in store or online  I tried to add it a couple days ago to my cart and it was unavailable .
- - Same shit all over again - but you did crusades  so it s ok for muslims to blow up the cinema or whatever . Fuckin childish .
  - Exactly . You did it centuries ago  so we can do it now is a terrible argument . Does nt work anywhere else in life .
- - I do nt understand why they do nt release more content . So many good posters  artwork  signage .
  - I agree  It was fun making this one though
- - Because his passes either went straight to the feet or sailed out of bounds lol
  - Uhh wut  Josh Smith is one of the most talented passing bigs in the league .
- - Also wrong . The Up Goer Bus is the first space truck that could be reused . It was not cheap to reuse  though .
  - Not entirely reused  the external tank was expendable .
- - Like the FC s are nt drunk .
  - They drink cuz ya ll drive them to drink .
- - You forgot pictures of legs on public transportation .
  - Oh yeah . Cant forget legs on planes .
- - it looks nice but I ca nt get over the fact that this once perfect ass is probably wearing an adult size diaper right now shitting self in a nursing home
  - That may well have destroyed my sergeant s ability to stand at attention .
- - How is the Simpsons not the top of this list 
  - Because it really began to suck after they released the Simpsons Movie . You know  the movie to end the series .

  - Ya the name kinda tells you what s gon na happen .

- - Sorry to hear this  Thoughts are with you 
  - Thanks so much . He had such a rich life .
- - Am I missing something about Ghost opening doors  Like does the prompt not show up but he can still do it  I have nt heard about this .

  - That s the best thing I could expect from this trip - welcome aboard  hope you enjoy the view 
- - Maybe they re a woman s pant  They look great though .

- - So ... basically everything in my original post was right . Thanks .
  - Except almost all of of it  yeah .
- - I m from the UK and have a Master s degree - do I say graduated from college  or grad school 
  - Grad school . College in the UK is not the same as college in the USA . But most people are not aware of that .
- - Wow you are rockin it  Awesome job . You re a hottie . You should be proud of your hard work .
  - Thank you so much  I m definitely saving these responses for a rainy day  especially when I do nt feel motivated . You all make a difference 
- - Holy crap  that s excellently done . So video goes through a wire from the camera  and there s an IR shutter release 
  - Yeah exactly . I was looking into wireless HDMI transmitters  but they cost more than this whole project combined .
- - My favorites are when guys have no idea how female bodies work
  - I have seen in my time at least a couple sexual fantasies which were clearly written by guys who had not quite worked out the difference between the vagina and the urethra

  - Male guards sleep with male inmates too .
- - I love this woman  Well behaved sissy  good job .
  - Thank you . I love to obey her
- - Anyone know if these are the DVD versions or the shorter TV versions 
  - One of my friends posted on fb its the shorter versions .
- - As our man on the ground  you should walk over there to check it out .
  - I would nt and did nt because the neighbourhood was locked by the police and my girlfriend did nt want me to leave as you might expect .
- - Yeah  that guy must be a real mastermind  I mean it feels like Sturridge is fit all the time .
  - They only handled his recent recovery in the US you knob
- - it is and maybe you were right in saying that s the reason they were omitted from the playoffs .
  - Who knows  I would have liked to see TCU in  that s for sure .
- - that makes sense but what is the sword 
  - The Washington memorial  I believe it is called that .
- - I love you very much and ca nt wait to see you after work to see you after work to see
  - Aw  your phone guessing how you re feeling is cute
- - He s got to be one of  if not the  most attractive guys on this team .
  - He ll lose that title if we get Joel back .
- - Im pretty sure I ve played here on Call of Duty .
  - That s exactly what I thought . Looks like a loading screen .
- - Jesus ... I completely forgot about this pill effect .
  - I know I only noticed because I was playing WoTL .
- - I m assuming the batman tape was your own addition 
  - i just took it off actually  you need a way to mark your stuff  culinary people have sticky hands .
- - I admire her enthusiasm . If not her disregard for expensive crystal bowls .
  - Except that s clearly a cheap plastic bowl .
- - Have nt you seen the episode of Game Theory  Humans ARE Pokemon 
  - Game Theory is really bad as they omit facts and sometimes straight up lie .
- - I hate to be the bearer of bad news  but I think Doughty fucked your girlfriend .
  - Ugh  she just gets all the luck .
- - I d rather that not exist at all  that seems really odd as an official feature .
  - Yea I know  its probably one of the most useful things Iv seen in OSBuddy though lol .
- - No problem  I ll think about it and get back to you .
  - Awesome  I ll probably be buying keys for awhile .
- - PeNiS This sounds soon cliche but I helped an old lady cross the street
  - She must be thankful to you  Keep up the good work .
- - This place is great - my usual stop when I want a good beer
  - Wish I knew about this when I lived in Bexley haha
- - Also  we ve been close to this in the past and it was a fucking disaster . Fun for the robber barons and pretty much no one else .
  - Agreed . More proof that the kind of people that believe in this sort of thing are not students of history .
- - Exactly  unless it s a two hoods for wearing inside  nobody really cares .
  - I care . My head will be twice as warm
- - did you guys know Staff went to school in Dallas 
  - I thought I might have heard that somewhere .
- - Hey  friend . Nice to see you here . Thanks for the GBB advice awhile back .
  - Hey  small world  No problem lol  what s your RSN 
- - Can I yell motivational things at you from behind while drinking Gatorade in an air conditioned SUV 
  - Yes  sir . I m down . We could start a le tour of las vegas .
- - No problem . Thanks for the info and I still really like your theme here . Wish I had the idea to name my dragons that .
  - Right  I got the idea from spending most of the last week of school playing nothing but skyrim and oblivion heh
- - You could do what I did . Use some hair restorer on your eyebrows and then dye them . It helped me a lot .
  - Oh  good idea . I ll look into trying that .
- - I just cant believe that they never tested for anything . It s crazy  how could they just let that slip and not go after real evidence  
  - Why run the risk of upsetting the apple cart  Jay gave them Adnan on a silver platter . If the DNA test showed something else ... why take that chance 
- - What is it with people using the sketchiest tongs going to handle crucibles 
  - It s exciting  Nothing keeps your senses sharp like the possibility of splashing molten bronze on yourself .
- - I use it for probe scan and dscan . And sometimes for controlling drones . Not often though .
  - Probe scan and d-scan  Care to elaborate 
- - Fuck  man ... Easy way to make a grown ass man cry . I m terribly sorry for your loss .
  - No reason a grown man ca nt cry .
- - Robot cat scorpion full of red-hot energy  Very cool . Red-hot energy farts  Less cool .
  - how dare you claim energy farts are nt cool
- - I wish I knew how badly it would be . I would ve thought twice . I might need to rush to the NPC that removes them for souls .
  - Cromwell can not remove sin  he just resets NPC aggro .
  - He actually does remove all sin  but only once .
  - I thought that was if your character existed before the glitch 
- - shit man ... made some accurate points here
  - Really  I felt a little weird typing that out haha . Glad you re not waking up in a sweat from it anymore .
- - I did nt . That was someone else .
  - Ah  OK. FTR . I feel your pain  Australians get shafted more than any other westerners when it comes to gaming .
- - Totally just big dick problems  not a concussion or daze like symptoms at all .
  - The NFL would like to hire you .
- - She s cute . It makes my JIDF career worth it .
  - And you act with indignation when Arabs call you out on being a Jewish puppet
- - Oh god so fucking lucky he did nt accidentally delete too many of them
  - Not really . We were making sure things were working before officially deleting . If it had nt worked at the start  we would never have done the rest .
- - That was nt even my point . I m well aware of Islam . I m referring to the overall point of his speech .
  - The overall point of his speech is that there are only a handful of extremist Muslims which do not represent the majority .
- - Jesus Christ . You owe me two minutes of my life back .
  - Is there honestly a more interesting post at the moment 
- - Of course you can get a lot more done if you are nt stuck reading to a baby . TLDR . I am making fun of the poorly-written title .
  - That title is correct . Of course it has better benefits  that housework is nt going to do itself .
- - I just drop in to random ones in the city . Most are open to the public when there are nt services .
  - I guess this was the main question and I did nt really know if I can just pop into random ones
- - What about the lady in pink at the top  Is she wearing a Tutu 
  - Yes  that does appear to be a ballerina .
- - Crosby tends to vanish off the face of the earth when he plays the Rangers . Mainly because Marc Staal enjoys making his life as difficult as humanly possible .
  - Subban does this to Sid too . It s fun to watch .
  - I m going to disagree  being completely honest though I love Subban he s fun to watch
  - He might make you happy  he might make you mad  but he ll never make you change the channel .
- - I love how pleased he looks with himself .
  - I came here for that smug look on his face . He s earned that smugness though for sure .

  - ooc . In DvZ  I m known fir building ships and defending them longer then shrines ...
- - Conflicts of interest are bad  but experience of the world they are legislating on is good . It s not black and white .
  - Not having a second job will allow them time to study the appropriate area they are involved in  and be useful to their constituents . Reduces direct conflict of interest .
- - so how long after you guys started longboarding did you learn to slide 
  - A Couple weeks of going out and practicing

  - This was already posted once . And there is no way you built those buckets by yourself .
- - I just want to know where the fuck Lindback was just looking ... So sick of his shit  for real .
  - That was nt on him  he played the shot  and your D could nt take away the pass .
- - Run a cupped washer boardside . It ll help .
  - Okay I ll try that  Thanks Josie 
- - The CASE floats . Why d Dick have to put a phone it it 
  - The CASE might float  but does the TARS

  - Thanks then  that s all I need to know
- - You re fighting the good fight in this thread  bud . Do nt give up

  - I mean . I know it s supposed to make your speeds faster  but I m stupid  so can someone explain that
- - I was with you right up until you said muscle loss . Wrong .
  - It s impossible to lose muscle on a cut 
- - Can we get canonical accurate weaponry too  I think it would be cool if they added a difficulty to change things to be more accurate to the established lore .
  - What kinds of accuracy are you talking about  I was nt aware of any big changes  but it s been a while since I read the present-day Halo books .
- - No offense but this video is awful . The obnoxious music and constantly moving text are nauseating .
  - I d have to agree . I was nt able to watch the entire video . I think the information would have been more effectively conveyed in an article or post .
- - Damn  Nattie is so damn paranoid .
  - THATS ONE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THE MARIJUANAS  OMG

  - Sounds like it turned out to be a sour situation .
  - Butter friendship was nice for a while .

  - I was genuinely curious and it turns out they did wear them . It s called a whoopee cap .
- - My boyfriend on keto uses cream instead of butter or milk . It s really gross but it works for him so I do nt really care .
  - Milk ca nt really be used because even in a half a cup of milk  it can be almost a third of your daily carb intake .
- - Next time  pull off your panties and stick your finger in your butthole .
  - What a very fitting username . Oh  and I agree .

- - That ca nt be the actual context of this . It causes too much cringe .
  - I have no idea what the actual context is lol  just found the gif randomly 
- - Has anyone inspected the new AWP ingame  Looks pixelated .
  - Make sure your shaders are turned up . Low shaders makes a lot of skins look horrible .
  - Shaders are set to very high  but I set textures to high and it fixed it  so I m guessing the skins made with terrible textures 
  - Can happen  the thunder awp has garbage texture regardless of your quality

  - Unless you want to  you know  pole plant and ski well .
- - Could somebody explain why it is a good thing when employers and colleagues control what consenting adults may do in their free time in the privacy of their home 
  - Consenting adults can do whatever they want in the privacy of their home  but if one is a supervisor of the other  they should report the conflict of interest .
- - Hati ... North Korea  I m sure there s a town called Hati there 
  - Capitalist scum like you clearly have nt studied our geography well .

  - As a Marxist  do you believe in gun ownership  Not trolling  legitimate question .
- - Do these get crunchy  I m not a huge fan of eggplant so this might be a good way to try it again
  - Yes  you may also want to broil on both sides . But with sea salt they are great
- - Fun  but too time consuming . Also  unbalanced PvP .
  - PVP is balanced  it s just that people with bad gear do nt stand a chance .
- - Fire Emblem . Awakening . FE is my shit man .
  - I m with you  give me isometric rpgs or give me death 
- - Sent  Hope you enjoy it  and have a happy new years 
  - Thank you so very much  Happy New Years 
- - Not gon na lie  if they re there  there s no way I d miss that show . Absolutely NO way .

- - Multi thread referencing  I ca nt handle it 
  - can someone link me to this reference lmao it sounds gold
- - It s a great exchange  but that line does nt really hold up on it s own .
  - Yeah  it was killer in context  but it s not a one-liner .
- - Or slowly walking up to them and reading their spot dodge with a downsmash
  - It was nt a read actually  it covered almost anything Hax would ve done in that situation and would ve been safe if Hax shielded too .
  - Technically it can be a read even though it covered every option .
  - Very true  however Mango does these kind of things so it s my guess .
- - Have you ve seen the other on AA  the one with the nanny that does nt want childern  She was getting bingoed hard .

  - I hope you are correct that sounds perfect .
- - That s a beautiful ginger bush . She is very hot
  - Thanks  She s usually shaved but I love when she has a little bit of a ginger bush 
- - Yeah  he was so lovably stupid . Like if Andy Dwyer were into meth .
  - In Vince Gillian s words  he was Jesse s Jesse .
  - Not only is that a perfect way to describe him  but the fact Gilligan said it makes it even more perfect .
  - I often thought of Walt as Gus s Jesse .
- - Can you please tell me what would falsify your belief in God 
  - Discovering that I was subject to Descartes evil demon ; what would falsify your belief in the Sun  or your wife 
- - It is . I have it and the symbiote helm is better .
  - Nothing will ever beat a fourth Golden Gun shot  which is a shame because of all the cool hunter armor out there .
  - I think do nt touch me s are better .
  - Than symbiote  Very situational . Symbiote by a mile for VoG  but DTM is a lot better in the first couple parts of CE  for example .
- - it was fun . i enjoy breaking rules and letting children participate in it .
  - was  thats the best kind of teacher .
- - i think she s actually brunette . and taking a guess august ames
  - Nah  that s not August  her nips are much lighter .
- - There s nothing to point out what I m supposed to laugh at . HOW DO I KNOW WHAT TO LAUGH AT  
  - Less resistance made me laugh . I read it as in it s a double meaning  for Les Resistance the French resistance .
- - Yeah  I figured you were either a troll or a dumbfuck . Now I know both were right  idc either way though .
  - Care to recap what this guy said 
- - Could also be that the sacred ashes temple was built over an ancient elven one .
  - Or history is simply wrong  as it tends to be in this universe .
- - Can you add up the troops that you re actually using for me 
  - Yeah  Belgium is doing that . Thanks for modding this btw  know these can be pain haha .
- - Is it metal  I guess its just black and looks like metal in the pic .
  - Yea  it s black plastic . Very comfortable . I frequently forget I have it on .
- - Never played that game so I ca nt compare . Others have likened it to Project Gotham Racing .
  - I certainly enjoyed Project Gotham Racing . Thank you 
- - Good thing they put a caption  otherwise I d be at a total loss to understand the intricate subtlety of that piece of art
  - Could have been a little clearer . How about YOU CAN ALSO BE ADDICTED TO YOUR PHONE AND THAT IS BAD .
- - first theory makes a bit of sense second theory about mangle not being the real mangle and the the non mangled endo being mangle is doubtful
  - Just tried to find a reason for him being copy of Foxy s endoskeleton .
- - Dear Hollywood  See-through computer screens are never going to happen . Stop trying to make it happen .
  - Can you imagine how frustrating that would be  Talk about eye strain .
- - Dash would be all sorts of useful if it did nt count as being cast  so you could dodge counterspells and sorcery speed removal .
  - You can still dodge sorcery speed removal . I hope there is some enter or exit the battlefield cards to give reasons to raid .
- - It s really just a breakdown of the word cyberpunk  so I imagine it has been around for as long as the word cyberpunk has .
  - I would nt be surprised if it was from one of the original cyberpunk essays ...
- - Does freshwater also cause this problem  or is it only salt water 
  - Both . It happens even when I m sweaty .
- - It s like following a bum sports team . People have lost hope .
  - American politics is all England in the World Cup .
- - It s kinda scary that the North Korean is making the more convincing statement . There is no debate regarding the idea that the person he is talking about exists .
  - And i wouldnt be too surprised  if kim jong il actually gave him some roids personally .
- - I ve got a Dome Fossil . Trade you that for a Dratini 
  - Sorry  I already got myself a kabuto . Thanks still 
- - I love that our rookie held his composure
  - Yeah  he looked twice as badass anyways just staring him down .
- - Because a lot of western teams have captains like Pajkatt and ember players like Arteezy .
  - Pajkatt . Ember is bad . Proceeds to pick Lifestealer .
- - OOOOOOooo i thought you were talking about like ten episodes of minecraft in an hour
  - I am SO happy that someone else had the same thought I did
- - here there is no difference in ideology between the left and the right  they aspire the same thing .
  - Radical of anything is nt good but let s not kid ourselves .
- - By the way if you go to the Network menu  you get all the PvP and event chips  Hooray for no PvP compensation 
  - Wait  are you serious  That s awesome 
- - I have a powersaves  so I have numerous duplicates of all items . And I can clone a full box of Pokemon on command .
  - EDIT . Apparently i have to give you something of value in return . Im offering up an electrike here and now . Very worth . Much wow .
- - How does an issue like this get resolved 
  - Through massive cultural change . Nothing that can happen quickly  unfortunately .
- - Same spot  but a QR code for your wallet instead .
  - That way  when they are done  your clients just have to move up a few inches and scan the tattoo to pay you .
- - You ve inspired me to try dry brushing for my next mani - this is super pretty 
  - Ooh  I ca nt wait to see what you come up with 
- - Hmm ... what s your place in Maine like  Have you considered offering a swap 
  - Unfortunately it is University providing housing so we ca nt sublet it .
- - You should probably see a doctor about that .
  - That s only necessary if the beam lasts longer than four hours .
- - I just got the Cadence Raw Denims for Christmas and they are very comfortable to ride in . They stretch nicely and feel great to wear .
  - Sweet  that is very nice to hear  There is actually a local dealer near me so I might stop by and try them on .
- - The guy uploaded every series Optic played if you want to watch .
  - It s something I might do in the future  because I was fortunate enough to catch most of the OG games .
- - Sacrifice drinking . Best bet physically and financially . lol
  - Upvote this more  so much healthier sans booze .
- - yeh if you watch the whole video i correct myself
  - My bad  was still watching the video as I posted the comment
