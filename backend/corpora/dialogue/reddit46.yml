  - hmm not realy  he waited for deathwing to follow ze rules and only then joined the fight together with his body guard peacekeeper .
- - I think the main reason why he is constantly nerfed is because he is often paired with a medic  which is quite OP in my opinion
  - which is fine  until you realized how fucked solo heavy s are
- - I love telling younger generations about older consoles . My cousins flipped out when I showed them the original Super Mario Bros .
  - Did they at least enjoy themselves   Or was it not fun enough

- - Except we see the camera move and shake ...
  - Fair . I had nt thought about that .
- - Do they have bumper plates and olympic lifting platforms 
  - It probably varies by location . I do nt think the Langley location does . I have never used the advanced stuff anyway . I use dumbbells almost exclusively .

  - I scanned the wiki and wanted to believe I was nt a beginner .
  - If your lifts are beginner then you are a beginner
  - I think that s obviously wrong  but if that is the collective reasoning then so be it .
  - How is it wrong  Doing a program meant for people that have nt lifted much before  And you are lifting weights in that area 
  - I have experience lifting before -- I was even a certified trainer at one point . I guess I was hoping for a great program to follow to achieve my goals .
  - It would be better for you to slowly go back into things . I get what you mean though .
  - I appreciate the understanding . It s hard to recognize how far you ve fallen sometimes .
- - Oh ... I have been overthinking this .

- - I m all over it . it must happen

  - Seriously   I think you were watching the wrong game .
- - would the idea be better if they did nt have to give up the IC title to go for the world title

- - She can  she just chooses not to .

  - Agreed . Just a reminder that this is a team effort .
- - It s not about the sex though  she s just plain unhappy with me .

  - but where s the fun in that 
  - I did nt know that you enjoyed this you beautiful sadistic beast .
- - When I was a valet  one car had opened condom wrappers all over the floor of the driver s seat . Ewwww
  - Yup . Also been asked numerous times if I have any condoms .
- - Why  If we cant see enough of it to recognize it  why would you be so captivated 
  - My thoughts exactly ... Does nt make sense ... 
- - Wow very nice style . Subtle yet crisp round the edges
  - Glad you like it  thanks for submitting a nice photo
- - Given that is supposed to be an MMO hybrid  when they release MMO content  old content is obsolete . I am perfectly fine with this .
  - I would agree with you if this game had the amount of content where they could afford to make old gear obsolete .

  - I just sold it for a hundred bucks .
- - Kung Fu Hustle is one of my favorite movies from when I was a kid .
  - I saw the original a few months ago . This just made it even better
- - I think Logan might have this one  after a long ass time . It takes so much for him to even feel a buzz because of his healing factor .
  - I have nt read the LotR books  but I watched the extended trilogy yesterday . Legolas felt a slight tingle in his fingers after drinking Gimli way under the table .
- - It s possible that they re turning around and reselling the articles to a legit freelance offer that may be looking for a specific subject .
  - But why the one topic at a time thing  Would nt that waste the client s time  having to sit there and wait for me to write every article 
- - where do you live  With your fancy glass jar peanut butter 
  - Happy Cake Day  Today is mine  too 
- - Thanks for the offer man but I ended up finding one I think I like . I may hit you up in the future though if you re still available
  - sounds good . grab my email address . I m going to remove it .
- - Thats interesting actually . I wonder if its an attempt at clean office air since lots of china s air is so polluted .
  - I dunno ... kind of just looks like a waste of thyme to me

  - Does nt matter . He deserved it haha

- - If only there existed some type of place where you could look up a CS gun and see how much they ve sold for recently
  - If its blue it adds more value .
- - In Murica  this would be self defense . Hell  in Texas  they could be killed just for being on the property without permission
  - In Texas they could probably be killed for lookin  at him funny .
- - How recent is this  has the second part been made 
  - It s not very recent and there has been no second part yet .
- - What the fuck  Real life does nt look yellow like in the iPhone pictures .
  - Because your eye has a great white balance system .

  - BAH GAWD  THE INSURANCE PREMIUMS ARE GOING UP 
- - I think its cool you and your dad are working on it together .
  - Thanks man I appreciate that  Everything went awesome I posted an update 
- - Whether this is in jest or not  it is NOT ok .
  - It s definitely in jest  considering the End the Fed nonsense is steeped in a heavy dose of antisemitism .
- - Not that I mind seeing Kate Upton but I hate the fact that she is the poster girl for this game .
  - I m curious as to who got her to do it .
- - I was rooting for the mantis the whole time . Also your parents were okay with you keeping a black widow as a pet

  - Your username is the most villainous I ve ever heard
- - This guy has done a few IIRC  and they are all awesome as fuck
  - I just stumbled unto him and was entertained from the second the clip started . His content is both funny and helpful .
- - I used to have fantasies about this sort of thing as a kid .
  - I still do ... be right back .
- - Yes  I d suggest bringing up the shadows a little .
  - Up-voted . Totally agree if you can bring the shadows up so you have him as more of a focal point .
- - Sex sells but bondage is a niche market .
  - Maybe  but WWE could really rope them in if they wanted .

  - I really do nt get that shot . Hardly ever see it come off .

  - Exactly my thoughts . He looks like a potential grandfather
- - Mass cause gravity  it bends the fabric of space
  - The bigger question is why is space wearing fabric
  - What  You want space to be naked  It s January 
  - Everybody knows space is in the Southern Hemisphere
- - You know  if any piece can grow into a new whole  does that mean a woodchipper is like a low tech Groot cloning machine 
  - I think they mentioned he was the last of his species . You could revive an entire civilisation .
- - Not sure whether this should be flaired Evidence or Transcripts . If I ve chosen the wrong flair  let me know .
  - Transcripts is a toxic flair to use right now  I d go with evidence  .
- - Have friends in Montreal will ask around . Thanks
  - I think it s a safer bet tbh  they will run out very very fast here .
- - That s how the party works . You fuck up  you find Jesus  you get voted back in .

- - Bacon donut made me throw up in my mouth a little bit .
  - Try one and you may change your mind .
  - Lol . Fair enough . It just does nt seem like it would taste good ...
  - It more than likely tastes amazing  but my god the things that donut would do to your body .
- - Also control the color of the text they broadcast . If opposing they should always show a configurable color  default red .
  - I see your idea as troll material . Not sure how  but someone will find a way to disguise their faction with this .
- - You work for this company . That s not a question .
  - I do nt  i just judge about the market and the suggested screen protector currently is the best one as it is also for the backside
- - Huh  wow . I m not really sure why the problem was nt over once you provided proof of ownership for your car ...
  - Technically a tow company  once they have towed your car  have a lien against the title . It is there property until the tow fee is paid .
- - Because we ca nt see her tits  ass  or legs .
  - Really  You did nt mention arms in that list  I m beginning to think your username may not be true ...

- - This will be great for trading races . Thanks  dude .
  - You re welcome c . Always love to help people out 
- - Tell her that her child will resent her in the future if she allows it to happen .
  - I think this would ring hollow  since her husband is almost definitely circumcised  and he evidently does nt resent it .
- - How do people live like this  Albeit my place is nt sparkling  but I d never let it get like this .
  - I ve been told he does nt live there . I might agree on that .

- - It sounds stupid no matter who you are around . Feel free though .
  - Yes . Purposefully talking stupid . For FUN . edit . I guess Im the only one who does nt act stupid for the hell of it
- - Philosophy of a Knife . Sick movie .
  - IIRC the director was thrown in prison shortly after the film was released . Granted it was Russia  but still .
- - I took this a very seriously as a guy that watched his trampoline fly away before his very eyes This is a good idea but just some walls up
  - I need to hear the rest of this story .
- - Test is one hell of a drug .
  - He s on waaaayyyy more than just test .
- - Just like this comment . It s the first two minutes .
  - I still see an asterisk with a mention of when you last edited your comment  though . Haha .
- - It s like those ad spots for al Quaida or ISIS . Marmite are basically radical Muslim terrorists .
  - I do nt think shooting haulers and noob ships is comparable to beheading innocent men and women really  you need to grow up a little I think .
- - LPT . If you re going to offer someone gum because their breath stinks  take out the pack before you do so .
  - Or do nt  so they know their breath stinks and solve the problem .

  - Because I did nt have my glasses yet .
- - Damn that is amazing . How did you do it 
  - I did nt  found it on a random Tumblr blog . p
- - Just give em some immigration and diversity  they ll be fine
  - Immigration and diversity . Is that what they called the nukes 
- - On both sides of the conversation it s simply used to convey agreement and a certain amount of friendliness .
  - But when you re the one talking  what the hell are you agreeing to 
- - Cerrone is like a character in a movie or something . So glad he actually exists in the MMA world .
  - He reminds me of the Bill Murray of the MMA world . You never know who he ll be hanging with or where he s going to pop up next 
- - Still not sure if this is a lie  but adding it to my resume anyhow .
  - Ahh  it s deleted now  What did OP say

- - Next Scott Stevens  Haha keep at it bro
  - Sad part is I tried this because of him lol
- - Before you guys ask  this is his explanation on the grip ... That goofy fin on the pistol grip is for California compliance  remember it s for the children .
  - There is no explanation for California . Wasting taxpayers dollars and banning things in common usage is business as usual .
- - Yeah I knew that . I was asking for how much you thought that guys camera ran for  I m willing to spend money  I just wanted a rate .
  - Which is why I provided links to said equipment ...
- - I only noticed the lag problem with league though and all other games have way lower ping . Maybe the issue is isolated to only league 
  - Pretty sure that s because most other games have East Coast or centralized servers .
- - CZ Nerf which was later reversed . K mate
  - Reversed  It still has a terrible draw time  an awful kill reward  and less damage . Plenty of people here were saying it was underpowered .
- - Nice . That s sort of why I went initially as well . Law school is tough decision but good luck on the LSAT .
  - Thanks  I m nervous  I need to get a good score .
