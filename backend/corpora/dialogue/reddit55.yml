- - You already made them happy by buying all these shitty camos . Why would you buy all this and then complain about them not fixing the issues 
  - Where is my complaint  I said I like this game . All I said was I d like to see them fix some if the issues .
- - From your video it seems like your talking about the Giants but I hope you remember the Jets beating bitch ass Brady  CANT WAIT 
  - Jets Fan Here I just know that play in general is their poison .
- - By all means  enjoy beating that straw man .
  - Of course . You make it look like so much fun .
- - You re on my front page twice . Awesome
  - Sorry about that  Ha . Thank you 
- - Has there been any mention of the next game Freddie will be in the commentary box  His incomprehensible northerner accent ramblings are the best
  - I do nt know but we do have Bumble for the tri-series .
- - What if he wants to live a life and not spend all day every day working on things unrelated to survival  This is stupid .
  - Religion is nt related to survival until you offend an extremist with a funny picture and you get gunned down for it .
- - Would you mind telling me what you fixed and how you did it  I do nt see a difference
  - You text looks like crap on mobile . Also no word wrap either . Looks like fixed sized font . Did you use some weird formatting 
- - Sounds like my nightmare  sounds like Conservative heaven .
  - Am conservative . I d grab my rifle and head out  as far away as possible .
- - Blindly supporting a team after they shit the bed is exactly what you are supposed to do ... You support a team whether they win or not 
  - it s scary how cult-like optic fans can be sometimes
- - she s so fucking gorgeous . too bad she s so damn religious otherwise she d be more popular than jennifer lawrence .
  - she s a religious nut  I had no idea
- - The smell ... Those who have not been there  do nt understand .
  - Preach  I hate that the formaldehyde smell stays in your clothes too . Trying to eat lunch in scrubs after anatomy lab is difficult because of this .

  - Especially with laptops being so light now .
- - I got a heart murmur and the legal crooks at In-N-Out are trying to sue me because my EKG looked too similar
  - They would do it in a heartbeat too .
- - Well I m afraid there are bad employees of both genders  but what are your experiences on how to get hired 
  - I ve limited experience getting hired . I was partly hired because I was willing to do two months training interstate .
- - I m not sure if that s a serious question or just the perfect pun 
  - I do nt actually know who Keith Moon is  but I gathered from the other comments that he is in The Who .
- - Shit  they gave my dad a smartcar ...
  - Why would they give him a smart when they could ve given him a Mini 
- - how fucking bad has Evans been for the past few games ...
  - He s been shocking . Making a major mistake every game now .
  - that tussle with Diouf that let him get clear was god damn fucking clueless defending
  - Not sure what he was thinking to be honest . Why did nt he just hook it away . Just ended up doing nothing . His confidence is totally shot .
- - Careful with all that edgy you may hurt yourself .
  - Or get gilded . One of the two . You never know .
- - Why not just put a fuel pump in it  and sell it as a car 
  - Also  along with what OP said  it ll take forever to get rid of that gas smell .
- - That picture in Bruges is directly behind a cathedral . The photo is taken from a tiny medieval stone bridge . I asked my wife to marry me on that bridge .
  - It s actually a painting  but it s not called Venice of the north for nothing after all .
- - It s not that shallow . I find it very uncomfortable to have sex in a house with parents in the same house .
  - Then why not just do it at the woman s house 
- - This makes it hard for me to generally feel bad for fat people
  - I do nt feel bad for fat people .
- - As soon as I got mine I popped it open and put cork on them . Makes them much more sensitive  I d recommend doing that .
  - Been meaning to do that  but with my current way of making music I do nt use the pads at all
- - Those characters exist for a reason . Remember this day  and when the time comes  we ll see who was wrong .
  - Ok . I ve been wrong before . We shall see
- - Agreed  however I do believe God gives us the free will to choose the priesthood or not .
  - Of course  God will not force us to a vocation ; He just tries really really hard to get us to accept it .
- - He would nt be saying that if it wasnt the highest rated show on cable though .
  - He s saying it s the highest rated show because of piracy . Pay attention .
  - I m saying if it was nt the highest rated show on cable he d be complaining about all the pirates .
  - But it IS the highest rated show . Because . Of . Piracy .
- - People that do nt use apostrophes are pretty bad  too .
  - Not as bad as white girls with cornrows  though .
- - How stupid can people be  Can you even read 
  - Pardon me  English is not my mother tongue . Might you be kind enough to show courtesy 
- - stick with capitalizing just the first letter of the first word in a sentence and any proper nouns .
  - Wow  you give Really Good advice .
- - The Fat Controller is called Sir Topham Hatt .
  - Stop talking please or I m going to end up saying things that get me on a list . or possibly pushed up the list .
- - Beautiful  but a little cramped for my camping experience .
  - All the caravans in this shot are actually ones in storage in an overflow field at the back  noone inhabiting them at the time 
- - Because cops everywhere are more concerned with protecting their own
  - And the government apparently looks like doing nothing . It s high time they should be made to stop act above the law . They get paid by OUR tax money .
- - Reminder that everyone in MBC Game Hero hated this guy  especially Shark .
  - is that true or are you just speculating  . O
- - I d rather be stuck in silver than cheat
  - This guy . I like this guy .
- - Are you curious or offended or what  I really do nt see the problem  like ... explain 
  - I am curious  but afraid to try it in case i like it
- - I love this joke  actually made me lol . Ca nt say the same for my girlfriend .
  - Does your girlfriend know you do nt love her 
- - what s that saying about pot and kettle  i think it applies here .
  - It does  but at least I m aware when I m being an asshat .
- - I live under a rock . What s this about 
  - What sport does almost every Canadian love 
- - how do you get pictures of the sky to not turn out like crap 
  - wish I could tell you something useful but I just stuck my iphone out the window and took it before the traffic moved off again ...
- - Shinovi versus isnt a port and the game isnt meant to be taken seriously
  - Those are nt very convincing arguments that it s a good game .
- - I think that Roshes are more comfortable  especially after significant walking . I think that Killshots are more versatile though .
  - Do the Roshes have decent arch support  My only concern is they probably would nt hold up in the rain at all .
- - Each time I have quit in the past has been due to some incapacitating illness . Take the next opportunity that you get really sick to quit and not look back 
  - ha  that s how i quit too 
- - It s not worth checking if this is true .
  - You act like meth is something you do once and are forever changed  probably addicted . Bet you re afraid of reefer madness  as well .
  - fuckin junkie  weed is harmless ... meth not so much
  - Whatever dude . Tried meth  did nt like it  still me .
- - I should really find some people to play with more . I keep owning all the attrition lobbies .
  - Try CTF . That s where the server gods reside .
- - So will future wars be fought with bums because of their high laser resistance 
  - No it wo nt work  you re only a bum when you come home from fighting that hits too close to home
- - I d rather have MacLean than Torts . Torts would only make things worse .
  - I put that out more as a joke  but I do think he can light a fire under their asses . Really just want to see him fight Quenneville .
  - YOU THINK THIS IS A JOKE     THERE IS NO HUMOR HERE ANYMORE
  - I think there is with the way people are acting .
- - It is not worth ionic you have a a Gjallahorn or Truth in my opinion .
  - So let me get this straight  the Truth is better than Dragon s breath 
- - That s very interesting indeed . I would like to read more about this . Is it in a Uncharted Realms article 
  - just fragments of information i ve read that kinda fit together  not a single article or anything .
- - I welcome posts that help me to think and reflect  but I just do nt think this is directly related to SpaceX . It is very interesting material though .
  - It s directly related to the work of SpaceX  which is as relevant as posts that are specifically about them . Thanks for the thoughtful reply 
- - You cant run people over with a truck yet .
  - A direct hit  yeah  but if you just catch the side the wrong way  you re dead .
- - Because they do nt return the favour . Cmon  everybody knows that ...
  - Also  you then have a zebra following you around everywhere you go . Sure  it sounds cool and exotic  but it gets annoying real quick .
- - So for someone not in the know  what was pre retcon beyonder like  why was he overpowered  Which tier etc 
  - Top tier . TOAA was the only person above him .
- - You and I answered this question in different ways  but this is a great and more concrete answer . This guy knows what he s talking about  OP 
  - Thank you  I m just speaking mostly off my own experience . Good to know it s not a load of BS .
- - I wish you could use his scarf on friendlies and jump to them as an escape
  - that s very very very bad in teamfights ...
- - Holy shit . Op your talented as FUCK
  - haha thank you  Reading these comments while high has been very entertaining
- - Umm k. Are those mother fuckers attacking us  Nope .
  - Oh  ok . It only matters if they kill someone you know . Got it .
- - In the middle of performing brain surgery .
  - Pakistanis do nt get the hiccups  silly .
- - Dang  I really hoped you wrote some sort of fictional bio s of some players .
  - That would also be fun  but that s another post .
- - Does the casino you work at have an IT department on site  That would be your easiest route without having to go back to school .
  - Yes they do  that s what I was hoping to get into someday .
- - The playoff losers should have to play each other
  - You really want FSU to get embarrassed again on national television 
- - Okay  I m done with this shit . Good night .

- - I know . . P You can get softbanned on console .
  - Well one person who invaded me was on my friends list and he s not a hacker so I do nt think the hacking thing is a possibility .
- - Is your other dog a Rottweiler Mastiff mix 
  - She s half rottie and half american staffordshire .
- - Well obviously not . They buy it for features such as the ability to pay for netflix after paying for xbox live .
  - Pretty sure you do nt need gold to use Netflix on xbox anymore .
- - the lights and camera stay on if the battery dies 
  - camera is attached to the drone . it is just cargo .
- - hmm then u should try port forwarding on your router
  - Look  the problem is not in my end . It s Valve  end .
- - HD Stream  The ustream links for the Valencia - Real Madrid match were excellent 
  - i would suggest checking those links again . they might be showing this match there too .
- - Does nt that mean you ve got to wrap entire functions in try except blocks 
  - In this case it will appear so  yes .
- - Jump cut when camera becomes level with bowl
  - That does nt help make any more sense of what I just saw .
- - Your debating what his goal was etc  your discussing it and giving it air time . Typically when you want something ignored you should just ignore it .
  - Yeah  they re telling you  the person who posted the article  that maybe it s not the greatest idea to do so .
- - I really wanted to see him succeed 
  - I think he was just playing . My parents have a similar dog and that can totally make that jump .
- - What are you talking about  Cupid was always evil  those Heart Bombs are nasty .
  - Well  imagine heart bombs from this Cupid .
- - I apologize for being so woefully ignorant of this whole process . I ve watched tons of tutorials but still I m completely baffled .
  - I think you re overcomplicating things . What us you want todo  Take the input of a textarea and save it to a file locally 
- - True  but a console is not software  it s hardware .
  - If you delete all the software that comes on the console then you can call it strictly hardware but then it wo nt do anything will it 
- - That s true  but it does nt mean he ca nt be concerned about his safety .
  - i completely understand ... but taking his stuff was nt the solution ... talking to him would have been better
- - We make fun of him but as a scrawny white dude I wish I looked like the original .
  - Planks  push ups . sit ups ... Not hard dude just get a routine goin .
- - Yeah I believe Coinbase has a thing that lets you automate a recurring purchase .
  - They do  I could nt find anything  though I may be wrong .
- - that is what it seems like  I just hope it can be resolved without another rollback ...
  - Agreed  Especially since the Build Contest just started and I know my Hubby ca nt be the only one who has put a considerable amount of time into construction today 
- - Batman versus Danger would be an interesting fight .
  - And Danger does nt know everything about his fighting techniques  unlike most of the X-Men .
- - I got ta ask  is there a story or setup to the whole saving dragons thing  Or is it more like zero context heroics 
  - There is a whole story to it . I enjoy daydreaming .
- - almost makes me want some yeast rolls .
  - Just what I m craving after eating my fill at a subpar buffet .
- - I think it has been proved extensively that reading is no longer the best available technology for intellectual stimulation .
  - You would nt happen to have a peer-reviewed source  would you 
- - So is speed basically the only difference between a pi and an actual pc 
  - Yes  just like the difference between walking and driving a sports car .
- - I m in Colorado ; it was involuntary because of inconsistent performance .
  - You were terminated for cause then . They do not owe you that time unless it specifically give it to you in the corporate policy
- - Haul is right  Lucky bastard . Hope it works out great for you . Be sure to post pictures of whatever you make from it 
  - Will do man  I m super sad I have to replace the tie rod end on my car today and ca nt play with all this new stuff 
- - Statham has the best sense of humor in that group .
  - haha I dunno . Based on this  I d say Terry Crews might give him a run for his money .
- - Why on earth would you just assume that fighting with other supposed scammers online would somehow make this ridiculous piece of shit not a scammer 
  - No I think the point is he cries when asked any of those tough questions
- - nice . where was this released prior  i have nt seen it before .
  - My guess is they came from the collector s editions . I could be wrong  though .
  - Yup  each collectors edition came with a making of DVD ... This video is a compilation of them all .
  - how do you get text next to your flair 
- - I have some HGSS and BW tiles if you want  they re for outside tiles only though .
  - Are they Project Gaia  or something else  Because I ve been wanting a good newer gen tileset pretty badly  and I m not good at pixel art .
- - Dropping hammers on all human life of Lithuania
  - An entire country just died of shame .
- - Nice work . Would you bike over the bridge  Or go around the long way 
  - I used the bike path on the Dumbarton .
- - Nice find . I just stumbled across the gif . I was just being sarcastic . I live in Brisbane and it s been really hot lately .
  - OP ... You know what this makes you right 
- - WE RE ALL GOIN CRAZY OVER ALL THE NEW YORK DRAMA  BUT LETS FACE IT  AFTER THE THIRD WEEK OF OCTOBER  THEY LL BE IRRELEVANT ONCE AGAIN .
  - THEY LL MAKE IT A LOT FARTHER THAN THE UNION . OR TORONTO .
- - That s not awkward  that s funny . Guarantee she was being sarcastic .
  - I hope so  She said a lot of strange things when she got dementia  but she seemed very happy .
- - Second in line for the pressed indie palette 
  - I will let you know what she says 
- - Would nt that money be better spent on the families who lost lives rather than a shitty tabloid 
  - Charlie Hebdo is definitly not a tabloid though .
- - I m not sure if they tell us . I always assumed that she transferred back home or wherever . I d have to watch the episode again to be sure .
  - she ended up on Riker s ship in the books .
- - No way ... So I can jack in 
  - Just be sure to jack off after a bit . Constant gaming is bad for your back .
- - Black Friday . A consumerist orgy following the national day of Thanksgiving .
  - I refuse to partake in this  it is a matter of principal . Frankly  I wish we would do like Germany and close retail on Sundays .
- - Become a Titan  run ruin wings with CE raid gear and behold  the glorious rain of heavy ammo 
  - Yeah but then you have to be a Titan . Sorry but I like to use my primary in Crucible .
- - I wish people would push this message more rather than acting like its unique to Islam . My country cant stop bombing people and the biggest advocates are evangelicals .
  - We do nt do it based on religion  unless money is a religion in America .
  - Uhm what  God s country  She needs a heavy dose of history and logic .
  - I ve tried before  but just let it pass because I do nt have the strength or desire to try and correct her anymore .
- - Not sure what the reference to route v wade is supposed to accomplish . Are you suggesting that laws ca nt be changed 
  - They ruled that it was a constitutional right . Good luck pretending that a normal law will override that .
- - I am a fan of Technical Analysis and Fundamental Analysis both .
  - Same  both great tools to have .
- - Why is nt this higher up  Top comment is wrong
  - Did you even read the article  It mentions coaches being able to participate in voice comms during the game . Not just listen  but speak .
- - yes it does  how much for it 
  - How much do you think  Haha I m not good with deals Also got mw chest  closet  lamp and sofa XD
- - If you want to help people  join the army  or do charity work Aiding the civilian population that s become overrun with degenerates is asking for trouble
  - So since theres so many degenerates we should stop helping everyone  Like there are plenty of good citizens out there .
- - Backes could sit the rest of the week  and get the NHL first star of the week .
  - Osh is still on fire with those sick set ups .
- - A bunch of people fighting and killing while screaming that their god is better
  - Ah  I have nt seen it or heard of it before .
- - I have never seen a virtual environment that needed full downtime for anything . Thats the whole point of a virtual environment .
  - Depending on what is happening in the infrastructure the outage could be necessary as not just the hyper visor is being upgraded but possibly the whole orchestration layer .
- - Why do nt I ever get to do exciting things like hold a baby Blue Marlin 
  - That kind of stuff happens outside . You d have to leave your house .
  - I just tried that . There was a lot of snow and no fish .
  - You have to look harder . There s fish everywhere  yoy just have to believe 
- - You know  it was really unclear .
  - Ye I mean Makorra could still totally happen .
- - I m really pissed off about the WJC cards now since we never got a TOTW Gaudreau
  - The players that were TOTW were actually in the game though .
- - And you HAVE to max fishing . I m sorry . rip op
  - Hahaha  YES  Agreed  And for Cooking they need to have all the BBQ recipes .
- - The flavour is totally different if not og heinz
  - Downvoted for telling the truth  This must be re ... Nevermind .
- - What if you re blind or have an eye condition  If you do nt want them drinking while using VR have the balls to say it .
  - Bloodshot eyes are the sole indicator that bar staff use to identify intoxication .
- - I got banned as well and had to draw a sock posting a missing persons flyer looking for the other sock
  - least the mods on here have a sense of humor .
- - Oh yes  this made my day  SR is my favorite ambient musician of all time  Thanks for this 
  - Went in for a second full listen earlier today . Just awesome stuff .
- - Wonder how many bribes and hookers were involved in getting a mandate to put a competitor out of business .
  - It s probably a less than you think . The national party has been surprisingly cheap to buy .
- - It s definitely possible but maybe not practical as your only form of transportation . Winter can get difficult .
  - The winter is fine  it s the random bipolar days that is nt .
- - This makes sense . If it s too cold to be outside very long  then you have less opportunity to interact with people physically .
  - It s not truly spring around my parts until you hear the police sirens .
- - The abilities are random but they ca nt have HAs .
  - And I d convinced myself that Poison heal was Brelooms HA ... My bad 
- - Gilly is a great commentator  but I d rather have someone else host and ask the questions .
  - Should ve got Roz to do it . She did a decent job on the footy show and Today
- - No offense but she looks very adult compared to the original
  - It s been a few years since the game ended .
- - what does that have to do with anything . Bankruptcy is now part of the US market place . has been for some time .
  - Because being in a union wo nt help you with a company that may not exist in a few months 
- - Who the hell is Scott  And where is Hank Pym 
  - Hank Pam is Michael Douglass . Paul Rudd is Scott Lang  an Ant-Man successor in the comics .
- - I thought Sips had another job as well .
  - No he s been youtube fulltime for what  a year now 
- - Confirmation bias . You would nt join that sub if it did nt affect you . Not all married people have that problem
  - I do nt think most married people have this problem . Seems like it s something out of the movies only .
- - That s when you realise that when you stick your dick in someone you ve made that choice .
  - Well you could easily say when a women chooses to sleep with someone she made that choice as well .
- - Not gon na lie but thats a pretty bad product . Major props on kyles handwriting though
  - Just got mine too  and I m completely satisfied with it . Not sure what else you would expect from a postcard .
- - You do know people can use Google right 
  - Dante WTF  you are not helping 
- - I thought that was when you had to log in to uPlay .
  - Eek ... It s what happens when your friend gives it to you for free
- - Barefoot  At least put on some flipflops man 
  - Summer is barefoot  winter is socks and even slippers . But not shoes  especially not outdoor shoes .
- - Your view of teaching seems very blinkered . Teaching is emotional and spiritual  as well as academic .
  - I suppose it is . I respect teachers as a profession and as a role in being a part of children s lives  but they are by no means academics
- - I think that might be my crazy aunt . Did she live in Washington 
  - LoL you have crazy aunt also  Sorry not Washington .
- - I see you re experiencing ST like it was meant to be played .
  - It s like Mor Dhona . a fashion parade where you get to try on the clothes you see .
- - I love your eyeshadow  Would you be willing to do a tutorial  or recommend a tutorial for a similar look 
  - I would love to  I ll work on putting one up tomorrow
- - Brilliant  Now to go out and buy some mice to try this on ...
  - Do you want mice  Because this is how you get mice

  - Sorry your friend is an asshat and my condolences . Anyway ... MAN my back hurts
- - Dude  your dog and your beard are the same color  that s awesome 
  - Yep  he is my spirit animal 
- - Gotten through your next day yet  Just got through mine .
  - So far so good . Warning . Do nt watch Wolf on Wall Street .
- - Keep complaining . We ll get it reversed  in Valve time ... Hopefully .
  - Yeah . My biggest problem with Valve right now is their total lack of communication with their consumers outside of announcements .
- - Wow . Some nice baits there . Are you on PC  I feel like I could learn a thing or two from playing against you .
  - I m on PC . Shoot me a message if you want my Steam ID . I m always willing to help people practice .
- - They did not become privy to any information . They are guessing .
  - Take my biased opinion for what its worth but barcastuff is the most reliable twitter account i can think of at the moment
- - What s happening  This is probably lame but I m confused
  - Magic ... ssshhh do nt interrupt the ChangeTip .
- - Thursday more than likely . In the meantime just snipe as many as you can  and then sell them when the set comes out .
  - At work still and do nt see it on muthead yet . What kind of prices are they going for in the AH 
- - That might be the coolest museum I ve seen in awhile . Too bad I live in America .
  - It s a great place to visit  You guys have some pretty cool looking museums too .
- - No i just sent some gifts  candy and sappy letters and one of my stage shirts  and a silver necklace . No biggie
  - I tried to reverse search the pictures and got nothing ... I wonder now who it really is
- - Beverley has been putting up some Josh Smith like FG efficiency lately .
  - I think it s official  The Josh Smith Cancer has taken over the Rockets .
- - This is because everyone has been taught since childhood to pretend Reffing does nt matter and that momentum has nothing to do with it . This is false .
  - Refs controlled the momentum the second half of the game
- - He might not consider himself a traitor but we certainly do . Fuck Cesc .
  - I do nt hate Cesc nor do I consider him a traitor .
  - It s hard to hear you from way up there on your high horse .
  - I just do nt hate Cesc . I never claimed to be better than anyone for it .
- - I thought a high IQ was also correlated with sociopathic behavior .
  - As far as I know thats only on TV . I have heard it associated with fetal alcohol syndrome .
- - Well shit . Did Gplay pick Nuke 
  - Yep . they picked nuke yesterday vs myrev and destroyed them . but aimface had the best of it here .
- - Some people do nt have supportive families  so that s not always the case . But yes  usually the most supportive people would come first .
  - that s why i prefaced it as supportive family  the brother or sister might  but parents would be last
- - Woot Utah . I just moved here so far so good
  - Just wait until you notice everything is about being Mormon like its a cheerleader click in high school . Besides that its a nice place to live .
- - I usually make eye contact with the driver ... I agree with the tickets . Drivers should nt be allowed to tint IMO .
  - i ll tip my fedora to you when a pedestrian makes eye contact because you will be the only one
- - Thanks  it s just how I ve always imagined it rendered .
  - And that s probably what I meant for mine to be  I just was nt thinking clearly .
- - Hello there  I have an egg that matches your shiny value and would like you to hatch it for me please .
  - Sure  I m online for a while now
- - That s what u get when you do nt use a real whetstone to sharpen your blades over the years .
  - I would guess they were using either carbide or a grinder of some sort . Sharpening a knife right does nt make it look like this .
- - fuck me  yeah  you are a terrible person . dunno why you re pleased to share that .
  - Wooah who said I was pleased to share  I would never admit that to people that are nt random strangers on the internet .
- - Ignorant here ... what s DOT and how did Donny ruin it 
  - Daves of thunder . beyond that idk what hes talkin about .
- - The video for Eric Prydz s Call on me . Damn 
  - I came here to say this . Better than porn .
- - Please use google for simple factual questions .
  - Was nt quite a simple factual question . More too it than typical speaking . Was curious as to because of taking emergency contraceptive  ect .
- - Are you saying there are nt objectively ugly people  Because I ve seen some ugly ass people  and that was nt open for debate
  - No  I m saying that how good looking someone is is nt objective . Which is why that s what I wrote .
- - Ca nt really blame it all on Haddin with the shitty underarm into him
  - but he was nt paying attention he had his hands on his shoulders from missing the previous ball
- - Cmon now . America is clearly ENTJ .
  - Ooh . I ve seen that one a lot too . Bullet point explanation 
- - this is America  you can find misguided activists and social justice warriors on EVERY university campus ...
  - But Harvard seems to be having a contest with Berkeley for the most extreme left wing nut school in America .
- - Rothfuss is one person . His anecdotal evidence means nothing .
  - So you do nt think we should try be aware of our own prejudices 
- - And seriously suffer from an incurable mental illness .
  - I m going to assume you re joking otherwise it s you with the incurable mental illness .
- - If you think that is puss you are incorrect . Try putting a bandage on your arm and the same effect will happen .
  - really  there were times i tried putting one over a spot and had nothing on it when i removed it .
- - Ca nt afford a lawyer and I ca nt get a job without status .
  - I would also suggest you to try to contact an embassy and not the consulate . Try getting a pro bono lawyer ...
- - I looked her up and it does nt seem like she has done anything super notable yet  but I find that disappointing because she is very pretty .
  - Kings of Summer is pretty notable in my book ...
- - What the hell is wrong with your phone  Why are these screenshot such a weird colour 
  - An app called twilight  or some other version of it . Saves your eyes  especially if you use your phone at night .
- - Uni . I was afraid to try it  but it tastes like liquid lobster .
  - For a second I thought you meant university lol
- - It s rare to see a comment that claims plagiarism without proof get anything but a steady rain of down votes . Sorry man .
  - How can you prove it  There was nt even internet back then 
- - Do UKIP not stand in scotland  I thought there was a scottish UKIP MEP 
  - They do stand  but their support is about half of what it is in rUK
- - Improper English makes old gimmick Sandow sad .
  - Maybe because I was born and live in Pakistan .
