  - You are perceiving an implication but there are no generalizations in that article . It discusses a specific set of individuals .
- - It might just be me  but every week I feel like the Colts defense alternates between being crappy and stellar .
  - The trick is to run the ball with an average RB .

  - Ok  maybe not hard to follow but improved audio and replay would make it better .
- - And why the fuck would we do that  Did nt he sign a new contract this summer

  - Because  if someone shoots them  it s bad  mkay  The entire police force takes a vacation . Just ask NYC
- - That might be the rare case were sequels are so bad I end up enjoying earlier films more than before .
  - That s a thread for tomorrow then 
- - Have you ever given the Jacksonville Ninja a ride 
  - No  but I do honk and wave any time I see him .
- - All I could think about was working on that crew  and hearing that same thing every day for years on end . Good or bad  you decide .

- - There is so much poop in here . Halp .
  - It s okay  it s all over now .
- - My dream watch . Wear it in good health .
  - Hard to control my jealousy as well . One day ... one day .
- - Yes the disk starts spinning and clicking ...

- - Oh shit . My pants  Or your pants  Synonymous  I might need some help .
  - I really do nt think you need to do the jerking off motion in my pants haha .
- - I m sure it s a reference to Vontae Davis .
  - how do you get that cool number on your name

  - Me too  I just cry about things I would nt normally be emotional over ... Heartfelt tv ads  happy endings in movies .

  - OP should post those temps since they d probably be more useful .
- - A twelve pack a day with a couple shots tossed in is nt uncommon in my circles .
  - EVERY day  for weeks at a time  because that s seriously worrisome
- - another clutch drop by hilton keeps cincy in the game
  - lmao  come on man that was good defense .
- - ah yes  I always forget that pesky tests format . Makes much more sense 
  - you were right to be skeptical about that average 
- - i feel like the gold bar should be closer to the lounge ... just sayin .
  - But there s the secret passage directly between the Gold Bar and the Interior Illusions Lounge .
- - If you think you need eyes to see  you ve obviously never had Jesus give you military advice .
  - With the military might of Jesus  you can see everything 
- - None of the above . the Bitonio game saving tackle against Hester in the Atlanta game was the best . It was also the stupidest as it should nt have happened .
  - Should nt had happened the first shot  the second time was just plain insane .
- - No  it happens all the time . I can do average if I have a medic  but other than that I suck ass .
  - Well  how many hours do you have as the fat man  Did you ever wonder what hindered your performance 
- - yeah its a lot cheaper but its a trade off . get cheap pc parts and the nsa watches you beat off
  - Well I mean  I would be flattered if someone wanted to watch me beat off . I might not agree to it  but it certainly is flattering
- - Or a single person who apparently had sex with the wrong person
  - And then it turns out that it did nt even happen .
- - as someone who delivered pizza as a summer job  my car looked like this often and the smell gets old

  - That s a great idea  thanks 
- - unless you are working on others ... why do you need a contour KIT   its pointless . Oh marketing .

  - It was a joke  sir . Calm your bingo wings .
- - Same  He always gets in trouble because of the gang .
  - But i ship Dom Butters and Sub Cartman  LOL

  - Probably due to the College Football Playoffs .
- - But exactly are the controls  Virtual keys  Something new 
  - Totally new for the touch environment . We started from scratch and did what we though was most intuitive .
- - I was thinking more in the sense of mains  for example  sometimes I m forced to adc but I am by no means an ADC main
  - Most of my most played ranked this season wasnt for my main  so the stats could be skewed .
- - I had Terry  Costa and Hazard in my fantasy team . Out of all the chelsea players I got the ones that scored . I also had Chadli .
  - Harry Kane sat on my bench along with Boyd .

- - Just say you have no mic if it s that bad .
  - Well I definitely do nt want to be the guy who makes it more difficult due to not communicating  haha
- - There seems to be a very pressing need to confirm that the oysters are  indeed  good here .
  - The oysters are good here  do nt you think .
- - i really hope that mura masa wins artist of the year even though rl grime is pretty much guaranteed to sweep again
  - I think mura masa had the better lp but grime was the better overall artist this year  but I respect your opinion .

  - she loves odd animals  especially amphibious ones . we were in a aquaculture class together so we re both quite good at caring for fish and such .
- - I would nt care  as long the kids do nt get a hyphenated last name  they will get my last name as a compromise .
  - So you keep your name  she keeps hers  and the kids take yours . How is that a compromise 
- - Shawn Marion hurt his ankle  sez twitter
  - Tweaked it  but still playing . Not a big deal until it gets stiff tomorrow .
- - But if you date a Vikings fan she ll be used to letdowns and disappointments  leaving you lots of wiggle room .
  - Do nt get me wrong . I m a Packer fan  but also a Wolves and Gophers fan . Believe me  I m all too familiar with disappointment .
- - ITS FAKE  A GUY SENT ME THE SAME PICTURE
  - Yea I thought so  I m on my tablet so I could nt inspect
- - This is quickly veering very off topic . I ve removed your question here  but I implore you to post it in the sub as an independant question .
  - Could you post a link here to that question when they post it 
- - You forget that they just make stuff up . LWu will even harass herself and then call up her friends in the media to report it .
  - true  but what evidence do they have that we re the ones doing it if we do nt even mention them on here  a hashtag  even they use it

  - Yep . Customer service told me I need to wait until a couple days before my expiration .
- - if you remain in BIOS for any amount of time  does it ever shut down or restart on you 
  - When I can get it to post  it shuts down after some time . In bios or in windows it shuts down .
  - it sounds like a heat issue  as others have pointed out . you need to take every step to eliminate that possibility .
  - I ve reapplied thermal paste and all the fans are spinning . The temps appear to be normal so I do nt think it s overheating .
- - It kinda looks like it s wrapped in plastic .
  - The crab is wrapped in rice paper  like a summer roll would be .
- - I m not going to make a joke about Hispanic workers here ... But I could .
  - Good call . I can tell it was nt going to be a good Juan .
