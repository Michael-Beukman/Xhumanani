  - Unfortunately  yeah . I m hoping that a veto of the pipeline will incidentally lead to greater adoption of nuclear energy .
- - Just hesitating a guess  but is it something to do with the use of brackets in the name 
  - The brackets represents Donor being nested within Experiment .
- - What if that turns out to be nobody 
  - Here s a question for your question . How much of my time and labor are you entitled to 
- - What abou the people who do nt want to wait for the new CO when are there IDS going to be shipped
  - You PM d me  yours will go out tonight .
- - You make me feel old  but happy bday 
  - We are all young at heart . Thank you my friend 
- - Reign Over Me and Spanglish were both very good with him in serious roles .
  - Never seen them to be honest . I ll check them out for sure 
- - It is a bit of a shame when terms are hijacked like that .
  - Ignorance leads to some pretty messed up stuff .
- - Did you reload any apps on watch or phone 
  - Nope  none at all . Only the pebble app on the phone  so I could re-pair the watch .
- - Shadow Fiend is an extremely clear reference to Edgar Allan Poe s The Raven .
  - Spectre is obviously a reference to the new James Bond film .
- - A mysterious package from a long lost relative ... that just so happens to be a plot hook 
  - A good excuse to roll on the trinket table 
- - Ascendant materials were easier to come by because you could get them outside the Raid .
  - That s exactly what I m saying in my second comment . It just seems strange that there are no other sources for these upgrade materials other than CE raid .

  - FSU is a penitentiary ... so yes .

  - Email can also be an iffy way to get in contact . Do they have a phone number  Try that  I guarantee you ll hear back faster .
- - Udderly smooth is a better brand of bag balm though . It does nt smell as bad and absorbs quicker .
  - They are very different products . The Lanolin in Bag balm is good for keeping from drying out . Udderly is a better traditional cream where it absorbs in .
- - I just gagged at the thought of drinking jack neat . Wish I could do that . My pocket would be a lot happier .
  - It s pretty horrible even on the rocks . Mtn Dew kills the aftertaste .

- - I just rock brass knuckles in a kydex sheath way easier .
  - yeah  my brother made me a pair of brass knuckles and i am very impressed by them . For something so simple  they sure pack a wallop .
- - How is it redundant  AFAIK a wedding band is the only real visual cue that you re married .
  - After they get married  she s gon na carve his face up to render him unattractive to other females .

- - They think it was started by an incinerator  Who the shit would be firing up an incinerator on a catastrophic fire risk day 
  - The same kind of folk who seem to be burning rubbish in their backyard  judging from the pager system ticker

- - Not the president the US wanted  but certainly the one they deserved .
  - He kept vietnam going for nearly a decade
- - The number of butt hurt people in this thread if the Cowboys win ...
  - And the number of butthurt Cowboys fans if they lose ...

  - Why do you say it s shopped and what do nt people s backs do

- - Delver is probably the cheapest agro control deck in the format .
  - Ok  I might have to check it out just to see how it runs and see the hype
- - Quality wins for SEC teams  Analysts only point to other SEC opponents for that  which literally proves nothing .
  - Wins against Wisconsin  K-State  Boise  and WVU should stand for something  no

  - Yeah  they only beat Baylor . NBD .
- - Which is specifically what op asked about .

- - If you beat the raid you dont have the checkpoint  only if you leave at the checkpoint before the boss .
  - Yeah he s trying it right now . And it took him not to the fight . For science

  - im at bowser jr  ness  olimar  and trying on greninja .
- - If you do nt want to be labeled islamophobic  do nt use islamophobic site as a source .
  - Fair enough  but any website collecting statistics and articles of this nature would be labeled as islamophobic  anyway .
- - But you ca nt see it as a spectator BibleThump

- - What the fuck did I just watch 
  - The video is odd  all about the tunes .
- - AS better solution would be to give a choice .

- - Prisoners . I wanted to see them save the father . He could still be in that hole .
  - EXACTLY  Because Jake Gyllenhaal solves EVERY case  Remember 
- - Either that girl is a genius or someone is feeding her lines .

  - If you look through key bindings there may be something for it  but that s the only way I know of currently
- - Does this tweak work for you  I bought it today and it did nt work at all

- - What did it say . It says it s deleted .
  - His controller broke  he could nt exo or something .

  - I m also starting to think that she does nt look anything like her character reference at all ... Probably some dude catfishing .
- - So you downloaded it just for shits

- - No  you re providing them with work . If they do nt like it  they can leave .
  - and go to another job that will do the same thing  Sure  they might make a pittance more  but it is still way below what their labor creates .

  - It really is  not to mention the turning is almost unbearable with the little analog sticks .

- - Now all you need is a Glenn and Maggie figurine to put into the prison tower
  - Got the Glenn  hes holding the pipe  but still need Maggie .

  - No it was nt but it s a good one 
- - I m actually quite surprised . I came in here expecting the shills to try and debunk these claims or pull some of their BS forum tactics ... Nice .
  - I was just about to say the same thing . I guess even the shills can not debunk what is so obvious and blatant .
- - Looks like they deleted their comment  what did I miss

  - Personally  no  but my team was familiar with him . I m the manager of VexX .

- - Why would someone do it  It s fine to do whatever you want .

- - Like five times a year this gets posted .
  - This is the first time I ve seen this  hush . I ve also never played videogames  I might try this one 
- - In which we learn that waterproof phones are not really waterproof . Or the more valuable lesson . Manufacturers lie .
  - Then they are liable for my phone and would replace it .
- - i personally liked the AYYY lmao bot . i lol d .
  - Haha well we do nt really get a choice anymore  it s a dead bot either way .
- - Only thing I can spot looks like a zoa . Maybe circle and re-upload 
  - It s really a poor picture  honestly . I ll see if I ca nt re-upload and take a better image later today .

- - Well iPads are probably better for kids anyway since they probably already used their parent s iphones or ipads at home already .
  - No  this will make the younger children think that iPads are superior
  - Kids do nt care if iPads or android tablets are superior they just wan na play games or whatever .

- - You ever see that movie Aladdin  It s gon na be a lot like that .
  - But ... Who will be the genie

  - Making up stories is not how propaganda works . A made up story is a lie . Propaganda is sensationalized truth .
  - So this story is true and you admit it 
  - So  you are pretending not to understand how propaganda works 
- - This literally does nothing to solve his problem .

  - Liken unto a boss . That s the way to handle it  sir . Control is often way underrated  or mistaken for submissiveness .
- - You have no morals  not in any meaningful sense .
  - Absolutely not . Not a single moral bone in my body . Basically because I m an atheist  I think . Could be because I eat babies .
- - Keep talking about yourself . Tell us more .

  - Granted  not all of those were specifically Masonic props  but imagine trying to have a serious degree back in those days .

  - fair enough  what switches did you go for 
- - The doctor called he wants you back in the padded room
  - Here s a fat bag of dicks for u
- - I do nt understand what you are trying to say  but it does nt seem relevant to the topic at hand .
  - The reason why you do nt understand it explains why you wrote your part in the first place .
- - Schurrle out Reus in would be a great move .
  - Do nt hazard and reus play the same position 
- - Striker and JR are trying SO HARD to put these titles over as things that everybody wants . Nice .
  - I ca nt remember the last time any WWE announcer tried to do that .
- - Great product and its helped improve my golf game .
  - Is that why you ve done absolutely nothing but spam it here for two months

  - Oregon made FSU wish TCU was in instead of them
- - Looks like future Corey from pawn stars .
  - That s what I was thinking . Especially with his half assed beard nowadays
- - I think they should have mentioned that the controller does not include a cable . I did nt realize that until I got home .
  - Well it never said it did either .
- - Screens . Again . Same as last week .
  - That was a ball in the flat .
- - No  it s already coded  because every other email already has it . They do nt even have to type it in .

  - Did you enjoy streaming Netflix to your tv
- - can i run my xbox on it

- - What happened to the old space helmet visors that were gold and covered about half of the helmet 
  - Yeah  I love those . I probably would have gone for them  but they wanted standard visors .
- - I know a few people who cant stand odd numbers in the car . Is that really OCD 
  - Not at all . What he just described is something very normal .
- - EVerything is always done in a context . There is no decade long terror campaign killing hundreds of thousands of christians  so it s not really comparative .
  - You do realize the crusades involved both muslims and Christians and both were perpetrators 
- - Do you speak Spanish  or were you just going with the flow  This looks like an awesome adventure 
  - Thanks  it was quite the adventure at times . I am still very much a beginner in Spanish but I get along alright . It was fun .
- - Does nt mean said items ca nt be added to other fits . Versatility is nt always the priority when your wardrobe is starting to diversify
  - Very true . Kind of hard to try out different looks if you re trying to buy pieces that can work with your current wardrobe .
- - be careful  when I tried it  it did nt work out so well .
  - practice makes perfect . That s what I ve always heard about faking how to play the piano .
- - If he has trouble typing something in the future you should teach him copy and paste
  - I asked him to do that while he was typing but things that come up inside an error window can not be copied and pasted .
- - That s crazy . Can you get pregnant in the other uterus  You said it had attached ovaries too .
  - Hypothetically yes but I assume the other one shuts down while I m pregnant which is good for me lol
- - I just do nt get why Cena could nt rush the ring like he always does ... and ended up doing anyway
  - or why did nt ziggler come out . or Lawler who is constantly bitching about not wanting the authority back just distract Rollins enough for Cena to make a move
- - The minor degradation in handling is worth being able to get a decent portion of your feet on the ground .
  - Why in god s name would you ignore the entire useful portion of my comment 
- - Just because anyone said anything it does nt mean it s true .
  - Agreed . That is why you need everything collaborated with hard evidence or other testimony .
- - The app says  lock screen integration  recommended stations  richer sharing . Of course that could be carry over from the last update .

  - I m with you  but I just keep it at the tip ... You know  to feel the pucker
- - you can do that as many times as you want in your dreams
  - True  but I do nt want to party there ...
- - Yeah  but there s barely any games for it .
  - That is true . Although more and more games are being supported on linux and steamOS ; many of the big name games have a working port already .
- - Lallana and Markovic are attacking players . Gerrard is a midfielder . Compare his defensive effort and mobility to Henderson  Lucas and Allen
  - They re not new signings . Markovic has been playing wing back and Lallana has been playing in midfield a lot this season .
- - No  you would nt . Please stop talking out of your ass
  - Uh if you or I shot our wife  yes we would be put in hand cuffs first thing . What world do you live in 
- - I appreciate the effort  but even watching eurotrash wreck is nt as fun as watching it with asian cars .
  - Weird  such a heavy bias  Did you get chopped by an asian car or something 
  - I drove one for a while  I m sure that did nt help .
  - Ahh  the scorned lover . I hope the therapy helps . D
- - can we have Henson  hell  i d take zaza .
  - I might actually rather have Zaza than Henson . Zaza has surprised me with how good of a passer he is .
- - What will the fans of the losing team drown their sorrows with 
  - Blood from the sacrifices after the game .
- - Finally  something we can agree on .
  - We actually agree on a lot more than you probably realize .
- - Why did nt you just ask someone in the shop  It s not that hard yo
  - Girlfriend took the picture during the summer but we did nt find the picture till a few days ago . And she does nt remember the store name .
