- - It will make the game boring . You can kill any of the larger ships this way .
  - I enjoy a great many things about the game  though ... so making combat a little easier is nt a dealbreaker .

  - If we stop dropping so many and keep wearing out their secondary we could definitely pull ahead more in the second half .
- - Pro of FF you can play as all classes on one char . For archeage you can pick three classes then change them at any time .
  - You can level all classes on one character in both games and change on a whim in both games  so that is nt a pro for either of them .

  - yup . the first half is great though imo
- - No worries Jets  its not like we re playing a division rival or anything  just take the game off

  - Please let me know how it turns out . Also  did you make the water tribe noodles  If you have any new techniques I am excited to hear them .
