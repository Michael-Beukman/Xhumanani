- - I do nt know what you mean .
  - Like  they ll consist of Mars atoms
- - Is nt the shadow if the flag going the wrong way too 
  - No  it s just a really low res picture and the shadow is nt even visible  that dark spot on the right is a different shadow

  - I want to see someone do this to a sheboon in person . I think I would die .
- - Her double chin is even upset by that
  - It s funny because the guy is fat too yet no one comments about that
- - Jon Jones and Cormier are probably in the hospital  what are the chances they ll make it out to the post fight 
  - I would nt think so . He has water and his belt there .
- - Bullshit . If you re so damn sensitive about a bad habit then do nt do it . Other people are not required to ignore it because it hurts your feelings .
  - And you re not required to be a dick . And yet  here you are  being a dick
- - So let s use western ideals such as freedom of religion to suggest deporting all Muslims because of their religion .
  - I never said anything of the sort and I do nt agree with people who do .

- - What do you think of the freshman class 
  - Some of them are pretty funny  but a lot of losers .
- - Its more about insulting values than being a threat to a god .
  - So what  Then let God be the judge .
- - Such a shame that this game is not even released yet but already looks and feels outdated .
  - it would be a shame if it would feel outdated upon release .
- - You deserved this  I m glad he came around .
  - Thank you  it s been a journey  and it will continue to be one

  - Good job  this is in no way related to the topic of this thread . Here  have a rotten cookie .
  - Sure it is  maybe the reason why so few people are playing HC is that they are sick of losing their characters to circumstances outside their control .
  - You did nt state that in your comment . Do nt expect people to read something you did nt write .
- - Umm there are casinos in France . Dumb ass 
  - Take it you ve not seen the Africa and China versions then

  - That would require some creativity  masking tapes and a very quiet room .
- - When I say quality  I m referring to rarity . Because I feel like we re saying the same thing .
  - Ahh I see what you are saying now . I thought when you said quality  I thought you meant that it had a chance to make the stats roll better .

  - For any wave with berserkers  I just use Magnet then air combo . Magnet again if they survive the magnet finisher .
- - The way he leans after the guy reaches over is what indicates this is a dive IMO . I can see your point of view but it qualifies to me .
  - I mean  it could be  but it s so borderline and it s impossible to tell his intent so it seems unfair to me to warn him over it .
  - Well that s why they start with a warning and not a fine .
  - Not really fair when a warning is  in essence  a strike  in the system they employ .
  - Or its a sort of warning  where they warn you that if you dive again you will be fined .
  - well exactly  so if it does nt really look like a dive it s unfair . I believe that was his point .
- - I have no problem with giving the guy a chance
  - Oh me neither  I just did nt really understand the hype around this guy .
- - Is nt Zack getting married this weekend  is this his bachelor party 
  - He said he s not getting married on his twitter  but disneyland as a bachelor party is dope .

- - So cool  I had no idea the straps were nail polish when I saw your first post . It looks so interesting and so doable 
  - Thank you  It really is a very simple effect  but it does take a little patience to manipulate the little strips of polish .
- - If you re significantly smaller than the one attacking you  you do nt aim to wound . That only pisses them off and puts you in more danger .
  - Shoot to kill  Seriously  your right though . If someone attacks you  you do nt go easy on them .
- - Waiting on her to text me back ... I think I fucked up big time  but at the same time I feel like I should be treated better .
  - How did it go  Did you guys figure it out

- - Wicked Eyes  Wicked Hearts ... I ll look for that . I ca nt recall that quest so maybe I have nt unlocked it .

- - Oh my ... should be an interesting update .
  - We are here . We are waiting . - Optimus Prime .
- - The comment has been deleted  Does this break the roo streak I was on  
  - I ve notified the mods  they should be working on it
- - I have Bravely Default and Fantasy Life . Either for Kid Icarus 
  - I would nt be able to do that . Thanks for the interest though .
- - Does this also mean no nightfall soloing 
  - Well we are trying to make things a team effort but hey if you want to join and only do raids with us that is fine . Would love to have you

- - Im sure if this is successful  ESPN will want to add more of their channels .
  - At what price ... I only want ESPN from this deal .
- - Who s going to pay for all the transfer payments to Quebec and Ontario 
  - Ontario is a net contributor to the federal government .
- - If you like any roguelikes AT ALL  Nuclear Throne and Crypt of the Necrodancer are both phenomenal . Especially crypt .

- - Why is Sif using the Moonlight greatsword 
  - Heh  because I got tired of coloring everything grey .

- - BITCH PLEASE . I STEM . Oh wait ... I have a vagina ... nevermind .
  - That makes you a unicorn alpha . Duh
- - Yeah  but the downside to that is that it s Identity Crisis .
  - It had it s hiccups  biggest being Deathstroke  but I think it was a very well done event  and would be perfect for a darker DCCU .
  - Different strokes . Personally  I do nt want a darker DCCU .
  - I do nt either  but I m pretty sure that s what we re getting .
- - Haha where do you people find this  xD

  - I think the video is out of order a bit through that part . Then again  he could have survived the first hanging .
- - Who drafted tackle for the Jags  Should have traded down if you were deadset on the O-line  which is crazy considering Leonard Williams was still on the board .
  - Im sorry I tried my best with limited knowledge .
  - Haha no problem  I do nt hate the pick  but the O-line really just needs more time to develop .
  - Honestly I did nt follow them too much and what I did notice was Blake was always sitting down .
- - I wanted DC to win  but I actually respect Jones more now . Motherfuckers a damn good fighter  and he fought clean for pretty much the entire fight .
  - I felt like DC was on a role until he got poked in the eye . Could be and probably am wrong though ...
