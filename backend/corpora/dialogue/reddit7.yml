  - it kinda looks like root now that you mention it
- - Jashodaben is a burnol trader  Your arguments are getting less and less coherent 
  - She is burning with jealousy and buying sacks of burnol and hence burnol trade is flourishing .
- - Swipe is extremely useful for that . Not a lot of accuracy needed .
  - I am going to have to try that .

- - Yeah I stopped watching after that season .
  - I wish I had . Worst ending ever for a TV series . And I watched How I Met Your Mother .

  - You do nt deserve  you earn .
- - Is the sky volumetric fog or just a video 
  - I believe it s a stock video .
- - He is a great player and very good for Wolfsburg . Shame about the release clause  though .

- - Best thing on the box in a long while . Hear about HBO 
  - Na what s up  Please do nt say US version

  - Failing to understand how that is relevant to your comment and quote .
- - Are you an interior designer named Trixie 
  - I m just hoping she wo nt go blind from him masturbating .
- - I would love if Black and White got remade .
  - Absoloutely  How cool would it be to use your actual hand gestures via Kinect to perform the spell casts ... Brilliant 
  - How did that work out for fable 
  - Black and White already has the gestures established as core gameplay though  just you used the mouse to draw the shape .
- - I m just glad they used a dead album . Great album .
  - I chose the dead album  and looked up the lyrics . They re just awesome so it was probably one of the first they added to the database .
- - But apparently Dallas does nt lose on the road this year .
  - You guys were injured in key places when you played them .
- - I think firing him over Twitter was completely unprofessional too . I agree with firing him  but the Twitter thing put it over the top .
  - In this case  I thought it was perfect . If you are staging a coup  the last thing you want is to have it blasted all over social media .

  - Yes it s a lot safer now though . Back in the day I imagine a lot of people got killed by their windshields breaking .
- - What does the guy s religion have to do with the story 
  - Nothing  but it scares certain people .
- - ok stupid fans being stupid should not be a reason to not take an acceptable player
  - It might not should play a role  but it definitely does .
- - agreed he was impressive . But in the UFC he has accomplished nothing the ufc rankings should reflect that .
  - His other loss was arguably not actually a loss . When compiling rankings there s more that goes in then just wins and losses .
- - Whelp Rockets just got their own free three points lol .
  - Still a long way off making the reffing even . Make up calls are disgusting  though .

  - The chop off your dick ones you keep making
- - Monaco is bravery on every corner . Poor Monaco nobody likes her .

  - What do you think it means then

  - Until they realize what screens would do to that defense .
- - Why does it seem like all women have awesome handwriting  I do nt know any women with bad handwriting ...

  - Yeah  I suppose that would take some pretty slick text parsing . Shine on  you crazy grammar nazi

  - Ohio  but you re right it is a long drive .
- - Any idea how old this is  I feel like I ve been seing this pic for years now 
  - Definitely a few years . Facebook has nt had that look in a long time
- - Nice to see things like this coming up . They seemed to be trying to block gamer culture and the sport of it at first .
  - The first day was riddled with technical difficulties so it was difficult to have any kind of atmosphere of free spirit .

- - I just found out that my wife is pregnant .
  - Hopefully by you and as part of a plan
- - You do realize how pretentious that sounds  right  You re looking down on people because they like a YouTube comedy sketch that you do nt like .
  - No  I m commenting on the standards by which they produce what they consider comedy . YOU think I am looking down on people .
- - By being greedy and wanting a greater portion of the remainder
  - A smaller govt has little to give . What advantage can a rich man ask of a govt which only provides courts and cops

  - I removed it . Sorry for that .
- - I have a family member who constantly tells be that soccer payers are tougher than Hockey players . I might show her this . I m glad he is okay
  - I do nt think someone who smokes that much crack cocaine would have the attention span necessary to watch the video you want to show them .

  - Not sure if you are kidding  my region is still owned by the Norman Anglo-Saxon nation .

- - Most vaginas have only ever been in direct sunlight when forced .
  - It takes skill to get sunlight inside the vagina .

  - Yeah  they got him . They milked him for all he had .
- - Skins and a touring binding . You ll thank me later .
  - How are the bindings without AT boots  Still better 
- - Why would they let him back on the field  Is nt that breaking the rules of player safety  
  - I think restrictions on player safety is a little different for quarterbacks in the playoffs .
- - I wonder if that would still work if the car was completely submerged .
  - I think if the car is completely submerged and the inside of the car is full of water  you can just open the door . Source . Mythbusters
- - How many times have you seen a woman lying around in a swim suit  The staring is because they do nt see it very often . Add hormones to that .
  - Hormones is not an excuse to doing such things in public . I have urges too to stare at them  I go home and do it on the internet .

  - That s totally gon na happen . So obvious .
- - honestly i ve kind of just found it fascinating ... its new to me .

- - Fascinating . His account directly contradicts some of what s written in the wikipedia article . Reminder to only trust wikipedia to a certain point .
  - Do nt trust Wikipedia about anything political . Just look at how often politicians get caught editing their own pages .
- - You can put a lot of things on some yeasty dough and call it a pizza . What comes out of the oven is usually hit or miss .
  - Making pizza is easy to learn  hard to master .
- - Yep it s more jays black and here fore the system is against him and it s ok that he lied . Or am I misreading 
  - You are misreading . This post is nt about Jay .
- - Your sport is more important someone s life . I get your logic  .
  - See this is the kind of ignorance that gets under my skin  but trying to discuss it with you would be like trying to pull teeth .
- - Thanks for the help dude . Let me know when you re going for Aethon again .
  - Will do . I ll try to get on again tonight to finish it with yall .

  - i have doubts that my lubu team will carry me thru hard descends
- - Fnatic forfeit  so it would be closed anyways .
  - that s the whole point . fnatic betters got their wins  while they should not have because fnatic forfeited .
- - does anyone know why some of the songs have beat switches as the end  kinda like an outro 
  - Probably cuz they thought it would be cool
- - There is a place in Ponsonby called Late Night Diner  its a bit expensive but fairly good .

- -  Oh crap  They must have removed it 
  - I have the German Netflix  so might be different for you
- - This is actually really cool  I ve been messing around with custom stages for practicing things like this too  so I ll definitely get some use out of this .
  - Thanks man . Glad you like it .
- - Or I can just lose the weight  It s not like Therapy is going to fix my ugly face .
  - So your husband married someone he thinks is fat and ugly . Who has an ugly face . But you do nt need therapy . Sure . Whatever .
- - The accent makes this seem so much more interesting and studious
  - It s Stuart Ashen  I highly recommend you to watch his channel . He is genuinely funny .
- - I ve heard good things about The Martian . I ll have to check it out

  - They sent a white stretched crown vic and reimbursed him .
- - I like to think that it kinda had some struggles considering Telltale was working on several different games at that time .

- - i think i prefer the panels facing the ground as thats what the ship would look like if it was in that position
  - Agreed . The panels should always be perpendicular to the ground when in flight .
- - Ca nt wait for all this to blow over ... decent player never world class  certainly the most over rated footballer of his generation .
  - It s his peers that get to rate him  not keyboard commandos .
- - Wait wait wait . Your geography teacher was also a basketball coach 
  - Yeah almost all the history or geography or science teachers were coaches . My physics honors teacher was the baseball coach .
- - My question is do you have a tool to build your coils 
  - Nope . I just use a screw driver to wrap my coils around .
- - You were there  were you  During all of these conversations 
  - Wenger himself said this . Cesc said this .
- - I had nt considered the constant  thanks for your response  that explains it well .
  - No  the constant really does nt have anything to do with it .
- - What was he saying about Africa s military might 
  - He said quite plainly that he had the largest military in his region . I then asked what his numbers were and gave him proof I had more men XD
- - Who the fuck is Leelah Alcorn and why should anyone care 
  - She was a transsexual teenager who was bullied into suicide by her parents .
- - Can I now  Last I checked he and fem freq just got a fuckton of power .

- - why would anyone give money to a church for god to accept their prayers  I m fascinated how naive people are ... LOL
  - What is astonishing is how well it works . It s all over the US .
- - Why are they respected more  do you think  Probably because if you damage a motorcycle  you ll need to pay insurance to fix it ...
  - Drivers think they can out run a bicycle but think a motorbike will catch up with them .

  - I put my foot in my mouth so often I cant afford to be too precious when someone calls me out on it . P

  - any type  some people have been getting snipers .
- - Do nt you have lockers to put stuff in 
  - Phones can not be brought inside any building .
- - Can we talk about how we may actually have a championship caliber team this year in the ATL 
  - No  sports fandom in Atlanta is a never ending vortex of pain and suffering . And we like it that way  thank you very much .
  - Very true  but a change of pace would be nice  right 
  - As a native Clevelander and current Atlantan  I know nothing but sports pain . I would nt know what to do with myself .
- - Acting like toilet is a swear word and saying restroom instead
  - Toilet sounds dirty . That s why .
- - Depression sucks  but the social stigma is even worse .
  - I never see amputees in public getting looks of disapproval . Has anyone ever approached you in any way to make their disapproval aware to you 
- - I would soak everything in rubbing alcohol .
  - That the first thing I do with any new atty  or after I do some modding work on them .
- - I did nt know they actually crashed on the map .
  - That s what I thought until this bad boy nearly wiped me out 
- - Jared from subway would disagree with her statement .
  - I m guessing she does nt have a lot of grocery store experience  but those are also primarily built along roads .

  - I can walk around the house okay now but walking miles on my route does nt sound fun . I wish I never had to go back to work .
- - wow  they really improved that much  that s actually kind of impressive
  - The schedule might have played a factor as well .

- - it s no wonder why conservatives are so alarmist .
  - I was unaware that presumption of innocence was a conservative concept .
- - I honestly do not understand the league communities absolute hatred for Runaan s Hurricane . Is it because nobody likes Runaan  Is that it 
  - There are very few champions where the aoe bolts are more valuable than critical strike .

- - Support grind to plat  What re you a wizard 
  - did the same  ita actually pretty easy cause nobody expects a support to impact the game in that elo
- - Well sometimes break ups are only one way and it leaves the other person wondering why .
  - But then does nt the fact that they broke up with you make you like them less 
- - disgusting . this kid will grow up knowing that violence is the way to get what you want . that father should be in prison .
  - Yeah the dad should be in prison so you can look down on his son when he becomes a convict and is shot in a drive by years from now .

  - Speaking of lines  you should have seen the one outside the airplane bathroom after I was finished banging Eartha Kitt .

- - Yeah  that s probably a fair criticism .
  - I also edited to discuss the trade more . Did nt realize it was an edit .
- - That s pretty funny . All the times I did pills this never happened . Probably just the ROA though
  - It s not the ROA . Most people that do dope will know that however they do it they ll get the hiccups sometimes .
- - If anything  would nt the kids in the inner city grow and be MORE mature than me simply out of necessity 
  - No . Absolutely not . The ego and pride are all they have . Being altruistic does nt get you fed or home safe .
  - I never said it did . I just said they had to grow up sooner  hence would be mature about it .
  - Aging does nt mean maturity . Not in the sense that would lead to enlightenment and removing yourself from the ghetto .

- - Very interesting  is there any way of uncovering these attributes 
  - You can use the data editor . In game  not really  but the personality and coach reports will give you a good idea .
- - No  USPM is a distinctly different style altogether . Compare Jag Panzer to Gamma Ray USPM has testosterone  sweat  and hairy balls . Euro power metal is flower metal
  - Rotting Christ vs. Immortal or Burzum . He has a point tbh
- - I try again . D to add you
  - Done . D thank you very much . D
- - Meh  we already have railways for that purpose  those should be the ones used for transport of goods .

  - Lol . I live in sunny southern California . I have no excuse
  - Haha I m in norcal ; trade weather 
- - Tom Cruise and John Travolta are so quirky
  - Looked for a tom cruise reference . Found it .
- - I dunno ... i think the ring looked for someone who could overcome great fear not whoever had the most willpower
  - In the context of the Green Lantern books  these are usually treated as synonyms .

  - The smell is ancillary . If the matter of olfactory equity concerns you then you should modify your diet to suit and let her rip .

  - Part of it is traced  so I guess it s not entirely done by hand .
