- - And now we wait for the porn ... Tis a sick  sick world
  - Oh  it already exists . This is a SFW sub  though  so I ca nt post it on here .

  - I would nt even mind the reload time if it could actually lock on once in a while .
- - I WANT A PASSENGER CAM  Seriously  how did he attach that camera so it remained so stable on launch  
  - Probably a suction mount attached to the windshield . GoPros come with one  though this guy does nt appear to be using a GoPro . Might be his cell phone .

- - This seems to be perfect  thank you for your help
  - I have this one too and it works great  cheap and easy to set up .
- - Maybe they re reporting this now to see if it draws the kind of eyeballs that justify recaps or beat reporting .

  - thanks dude  I will  feel free to tell me anything you need and it s yours if I have it
- - Not a bad idea  but I think it would make a bit more sense to show the last kill instead . But thats just me
  - Yeah that s a good idea too . But I feel that the last kill can sometimes be a little lackluster .
- - Sadly Pakistan PM is a puppet . Most of the power lies with ISI and he is not even aware of half the things going on there .

  - Yes they are  I ll work on making them not so obtrusive though .
- - I am a host for AirBNB . Please contact their emergency line immediately  This is so fucking creepy .

  - Money is tight . It s free food and I do love my mom .
- - Not good due to the specs at that time . No good CPU GPU at that moment at all
  - Still using it  it s like a zombie - it s dead  but it s still running fine ...

- - I d kick her ass out of there 
  - If you had someone big enough . What is it with fast food and people throwing fits over their order 
- - I guess the west could nt have fought the Axis and the SU at the same time .
  - Or wait for them to nearly destroy each other  then sweep up the mess quickly .
- - And because you call yourself something like the pussy master  as far as I can remember 
  - I never called myself actually  but I was called that on several occasions .
- - I guess returns was the wrong word . Basically asking if one tends to be more expensive than the other .
  - Your question makes no sense and has nothing to do with investing . In how many ways do you want people to put this 
- - I swear tumblr is just an mmorpg within a blog
  - One of those shitty MMO s that no one plays .
- - How are people booing this  It looks pretty obvious .
  - Home crowd will boo anything that goes against them

- - I hope you acted confused that he did nt appear in the picture . That would have made his night .
  - I honestly thought this would end in the picture without him in it
- - Awesome  I will do that this weekend  Unless you re interested in trades for one 
  - Mostly need the cash but I ll hear out any offers . Kind of maxed out on vaping stuff though .
- - check out new vintage  time and space  or hideaway saloon . all are great shithole bars that are good for small bands .
  - Seconded . I have nt been to Kaiju yet  but that might be an option . And the Rudyard Kipling .
- - That was a disgrace . This idiot should be let in so the world can know how retarded she is .
  - I do nt think she needs to be let in for that to happen .
- - There are various kinds  some even without the training pyrotechnics . These can also be turned into real grenades with some fancy welding and a decent charge .
  - Hmm I never actually thought about that  would nt the welds give out to that much pressure though 
- - Its possible  question  can you take the harddrive out of that computer that is dying

- - yup . Lets fuck it over for everyone else because your husband is a piece of shit
  - I can see you re taking a very mature and nuanced view on the topic so I m not going to attempt to argue with you .
- - sure i ll add you  message me what you want help with and what not so I can think about things etc

- - Also please bring back the Leafs Report podcast James please
  - I do nt use twitter so I m not fully up on why they stopped ... anyone know 
- - jesus shit . i think phone call number one after seeing one of those posters would have been to the police .
  - Those posters were specifically targeting those people with vitriolic language . I agree that it s absolutely harassment .
- - Only shoot I ve seen where her hair is nt curly . Couple of firsts there 
  - I ve also never seen her with any toys  let alone anal beads
- - It s cool -- but it does nt really show up .
  - If I ca nt make it look like Christopher Walken  then it still needs work
