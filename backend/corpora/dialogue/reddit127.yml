  - No no  your thinking of Oman . Obama is a small country on the the tip of the Arabian peninsula .
  - No no  you re thinking of The Omen . Oman was a horror movie .
- - I ve never wanted to join a group this much . Very motivating video .
  - I checked their youtube channel and no updates for a few years . I hope they are still active or at least other organizations have filled in the gaps .
- - I do nt think thats the preferred nomenclature  Walter .
  - We re not talking about a guy who wrote the fundamental works of western philosophy here .

- - surprise  not entire world have english as native

  - This I agree with . But for me  I have to be high still for it to have that effect  at least a little bit .
- - Right  because nobody bets on what will get them the biggest return on their money ...
  - That s exactly where they bet and that s exactly why the betting odds are the most accurate prediction you will get before the game .
- - Lol oh my goodness . Im not sure what to say to that last part
  - Well it s just the truth . No point in holding punches now . It was one of those relationships you wish you had nt wasted so much time on .
- - It s Jerusalem  actually ; the city that tortures and kills its prophets . Does it have to be spelled out any more clearly

- - Monogamy promotes genetic diversity does it not  Is nt this an evolutionary advantage to monogamy 
  - There s an evolutionary advantage to raping everybody you want  but I m not going for that either .
- - At the time I think the West Indian islands would have been considered part of the United Kingdom .
  - No they would nt . They were colonies  not part of the UK itself .
- - It s better if you watch it with the expectations of a horror movie
  - That s true . I m just ruining things for everyone . I ll go sit over in the corner for a bit .
- - In my opinion it will happen much sooner than that . People are starting to hear about Bitcoin and get excited about it

- - I m split because what you described happens a lot but sometimes Patty Kane will lay a devastating hit when I do nt mean to also ...
  - Yea true . I m going to try it out and see how I like it . Turning off auto back skate was clearly the way to go however .
  - Turn it off guys . It s worth it . I ca nt play a game with it on anymore .
  - Thanks . I ll definitely try it out .
- - These are going too fast . I ca nt examine them before the next one shows up
  - Then I suggest checking the magazine itself . I think the point of the gif is to give you the gist of what they do .
- - You re crazy if you like Fer and not Yaya
  - I do nt really like either to be honest haha but Leroy Fer s been better for me
- - this has happened to me too  i listen to about everything including heavier stuff but now days i enjoy soft stuff like piano and acoustics .
  - Yeah thats the kind I ve been listening to
- - Stand up for free speech or lose free speech . There are no other options .
  - YES THERE ARE  THIS IS NT A BINARY CHOICE 
- - Fuck that . Have you ever tried watching a D-League game  Having no crowd makes the game more boring than you think .
  - Not sure if it s the lack of crowd ... or D-League .
- - That s incredibly well thought out . I m impressed . Next time I ll pick a less lame super power .
  - Thank you . Although I do nt have a clue what my username will do .
- - would nt including tax on each item essentially do the same thing as taxing the total  or does that not add up ... maths ...

- - hey guys  the first sounded so boring
  - If by boring you mean depressing  then yes .
- - Well if you cut off your balls at the suggestion of some guru the world might be better off without your children . Still horrible though .
  - Thinking along the same lines . The world has an issue with uncontrolled population growth .
- - Great shot but Oscar should be doing better there .
  - What else could have Oscar done  apart from foul him 
  - Keep the pressure on him so he does nt shoot . Essentially what Oscar did was guide him into a great shooting position then let him have a shot .
  - Watch the build up again . Oscar was the wrong side of him - the only way he could have pressured him would have ended in a foul .
- - I hit refresh on kijiji until my eyes bleed . Still only find a few good deals a week .
  - Do you know that there is an app to just notify you when a new ad is posted with your keywords 
- - Scrappy getting out of a rundown twice . Or Harper running into the wall at Dodgers stadium . That was hilarious .
  - Maybe one day I ll understand why a guy seriously injuring himself is hilarious .
  - He did nt die and he s still playing baseball . He s obviously fine .
  - His knee had to be surgically repaired from that . He s fine two years later  but it was still a serious injury .
- - He probably was just trying to keep up with TM s lineup changes .
  - Probably . But I still got some nice clubs in the process
- - I use twitter . Is that better doing a blog or is a blog better  I found myself limit how much on could type on twitter .

  - Seriously  Does anyone do that  Oh my god .
- - I m very familiar with long routes  travelled all over Europe on buses and trains 
  - Not the same . In Europe  The scenery changes .
- - What s far more likely is he meant something else and you misunderstood it . You re overreacting quite a bit .
  - I would like to see you explain it then since you feel i misunderstood it .
- - Nice  you did nt even read the whole article where the author concludes that despite how dirty it is they got more out of visiting it than any other country .
  - Oh I think that Japanese girl got more from India than anywhere else too
- - giving the clicks to neogaf instead  I do nt know which is worse .
  - neogaf is the source for the article .
- - Can you make the background something easier on the eyes  It s badass but I do nt care for all the white
  - Sure  I ll make it black 
- - Sorry but we are nt going to do something that most Americans oppose . You are going to have to accept the political reality that gun control is very unpopular .
  - Yeah  treating blacks as humans used to be unpopular .
- - So you re saying I have got this dead wrong . Sweet 
  - Yeah  for good or bad we will probably have to stay with Jennings for the next two years .

- - THAT POWERPLAY WAS HORSESHIT . SHOOT THE DAMN PUCK .
  - I felt like pulling my hair out the whole time . Pass pass pass pass
- - I am gon na be so sleepy and hungover tomorrow . It s gon na suck .
  - I always take advil and drink a bottle of water before I sleep and I rarely get hangovers  I ll just sleep super late lol

  - I m still not impressed with his final balls . He got that great assist last week  but as it stands it s a glaring hole in his resume .
- - No  you re forgetting CEOs who make money off of it and many  many  conservatives who think its just fine .
  - Democrats will do it just the same . Both parties represent the elite ruling class .
- - This is in DEN so makes sense .
  - Not really . DIA is one of the only places in the state where weed is still illegal .
- - You hooked up with a girl  revamped your personality  met a new girl  and got married all within a single season

  - I m still waiting on more fans  GPU and CPU cooler . Assembled everything to make sure everything worked . I ll do the pics right now
- - I m not particularly in the mood for this debate today so you ll just have to have it with someone else . I suspect that wo nt be difficult .
  - Strange how you back down once I ask for proof on a claim .
- - Those audiences also require at least one nude chick per episode .
  - We would be satisfied with that number going a little bit lower if necessary . Just a pair of disembodied titties in the background or something .
- - Also it s not like it suddenly gets good either . It kind of tapers in . I ca nt really figure out the exact point where it got good .
  - The Winter Soldier tie-in episode is where it got particularly good . Then the rest of the series is like a tie-in to that .
- - The woman drinking the ketchup is on NY s upper west side  if that helps .
  - The cheese eater is in Spokane Washington in Riverfront Park . Highly unlikely these are the same people .
- - There s a difference between forcing fouls via aggressive drives and somehow getting bodied with no one else around .

- - Exactly like my dog wo nt show any attention to me but the second my hand touches that drawer she s comes running to me weird
  - it s crazy . I would ve thought all fridge drawers sound the same 
- - ok i will post pics of my mflb . what should i do for verification 
  - Just write your name and the date on a sheet of paper
- - Thanks . I will apply if there is space
  - A few slackers have been kicked  it seems . If you want in  go ahead and join . We re about to start a new op .
- - No  it s because of the holidays and more people taking vacations .
  - I do nt know if I should up vote for sarcasm or down vote for retardation
- - Yeah  maybe not as much anymore since he has been out of the spotlight for a while now .
  - Thats true . Being the champ does make that spotlight burn brighter .
- - Hardly . The people who want their pay in Bitcoin would ve bought Bitcoin anyway . Otherwise why ask for it 
  - wut  has nothing to do with that . it s about Overstock having to buy millions of dollars worth of bitcoins in order to pay their staff .
- - You guys go ahead I wan na fight using my own characters
  - I know this wo nt appeal to everybody  and I actually would nt have accepted this offer myself . But if anybody is interested  this offer stands .
- - So what  People wo nt get robbed or shot trying to sell these on craigs list 
  - It s unlikely anyone would sell these on craigslist for that very reason . They d be stupid to do so and put themselves in danger because of it .
- - Damn . Sexy ass IDs . A friend and I will be ordering within a week  I m just waiting for her to pay the fuck up hahaha
  - sweet haha look forward to doing business 
  - I already have a specific state in mind  but out of curiosity what s your favorite that you make 
  - love them all but DE seems the most popular
- - did you try updating the firmware or consider installing DDWRT
  - Its currently using a variant of Tomato .
- - He s sponsored by Yamaha  so I m sure he s giving his honest opinion . Sounds great  though .
  - do nt even bother watching them anymore  worthless .
- - Love s stroke does nt look very pretty
  - What  He has one of the most textbook forms in the game . He just does nt have to jump very high because he s so strong .
- - Then i guess it d be something we can never have
  - Nah it ll just be on The Fragile reissue .
- - they just are nt  they re realllly fun do nt get me wrong but they just are nt as awesome as you hear about .
  - I can definitely see that though . From what I hear anyway
- - Target . BUY ALL THE GIFT CARDS 
  - This is the answer . That is a smart loophole .
  - Buy all target gift cards  or gift cards for other stores 
  - Hey  if it s at the store you can buy it  right  So looks like you can get gift cards for other places 
- - If yes I have to say he is a lucky guy . o
  - I did yes  after a long streak of no luck I got this and nearly choked of surprise
- - Do nt do aftermarket torsion lift keys . They are The devil .
  - Thanks for the advice . MY TRUCK RUNS ONLY ON JESUS CHRIST MY LORD AND SAVIOR .

  - Fun fact . Harry Kane is a Patriots fan ... makes me like him even more
- - Journalists fudging quotes  I do nt believe it .
  - I too am shocked by the possibility that the media would do such a thing ... It s outrageous 
- - use skip if you want to feed to the same monster  use back if you re done feeding that monster .
  - now this is something I actually just learned like a month ago .
- - Hahahaha seriously though  this shit is dumb .
  - It has plenty of truth behind it though
- - No guys . The only place I support this is GOT . Because Cersei and Jaime were made for each other .
  - Ever seen Carnivale  I have deep complicated meta to justify Justin and Iris .
- - Oh man that makes me mad . Oh man . That kid was RIGHT .
  - Not according to the reading passage the student had most likely been given . Did you never have reading comprehension practice in school 
- - True  but I think it comes down to the players mentality and things like how hard he trains . It s not always talent alone .
  - he was sent back from loan because he was nt training well and had poor professionalism etc
- - Love me some butter burgers and cement mixers ... but In-n-Out is superior in my opinion . Great work on the drawer 
  - I m a huge Lebowski fan and would love to try the In-n-Out burger if I ever make it to CA .
- - Does anyone care to explain what happened 
  - No one really knows right now . Im sure stuff will begin to unravel in the next few days .
- - If you move in a way that cars do nt have to avoid you there s no problem .
  - Agreed  but in heavily trafficked areas  this is at best highly unlikely due to a lull in traffic .
- - They do change color when you hover over the link  but when I m not  I ca nt differentiate between the two . Are the links a darker black 
  - Yes  they are  but it is too subtle .
- - Is anyone hopeful that the French police will find the murderers 
  - It s incredibly surprising to me that they have nt yet . Which implies to me this was planned extremely well and carried out by definitely trained people .
  - It happened at the board meeting too . Very well planned .
