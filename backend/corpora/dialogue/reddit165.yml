  - that movie was straight brutal at times . I do nt even have kids  and I wanted to go home and tell them I loved them after watching Interstellar .
- - It s not apathy  they ve gone on record many times saying they try to strike a balance between protecting their interests and letting their fans express themselves .
  - Okay  but also  I d be surprised if they even saw half of these fan games or were aware of half of them .
- - do all cowboys fans have a victim complex

- - I wonder if the decline in contraceptive provision was due to more women falling under ObamaCare and therefore getting it elsewhere . That would be awesome .

- - That is some terrible coaching . You absolutely can not waste a TO like that
  - got the first it was worth it i guess

  - Haha  thanks . The results when I posted it to Instagram were hilarious  as Instagram does nt allow titles

  - And we have video of him after he fucked a Brazilian prostitute .
- - I got all excited at first because I thought the location would be a VA Hospital ...
  - No  just the state of Virginia .

- - it might just be me but if i recall correctly playing in windowed made the game more finicky
  - I suppose that could be the case . But why would the game run fine when I exit Steam 
- - Even still  it s pretty neat looking . Normally replicas look sloppy like they were made with junkyard sheet metal .
  - It was very clean considering a guy made it in his garage . Even held up through a few burnouts and drifts .

- - Asians making fun of Americans will never not be funny .
  - Anybody making fun of Americans will never not be funny .

  - Thought they would be of interest give that they are a parody of the flash s rogues ... but I can see your point
- - I m a lefty  have been my entire life  and not once have I ever considered using the mouse with my left hand . It s just so awkward
  - Yeah I was assimilated into the righty world quite early  only thing i do nt do with my right is using a pencil
- - Imagine trimming your pubes with that thing ... Go ahead ... Just imagine it ...
  - I imagined your mom . Dam machine got jammed .
- - the funny thing is in these types of games  at least at my level  most carry s always wins .
  - its because people doesnt really know to use their advantage on early game and finish the game
- - JAMEIS WAS DOWN TIME TO CRUCIFY HIM AND MAKE HIM SUFFER FOR THE ETERNITY

  - I do nt think so . IIRC someone said it was from some doujin .
- - So is Deluge . Deluge also does nt force you to download an older version to avoid the bullshit the new utorrent versions added .
  - Deluge is banned on a few trackers .
- - Each shape . Draw focus to your neckline with a scoop or vneck to show everyone there is indeed a somehow still alive human hiding underneath all that grease and fat 
  - Show dem titties so a man will look at you with some semblance of sexual interest 
- - Yo buddy  it s your limited language  not mine .
  - All right  you ve convinced me  You deserve garbage friends 
- - nope nope nope ca nt watch the begining absolutely disgusts me 
  - yeah the beginning scene always gets to me  well worth the watch and SHARE
- - Ah yes  the fabled Bacon Lion .
  - Almost as good as Bacon Dog and Bacon Legs .
- - i do nt think you can speed up animations in the game .
  - not in game but in your inventory . Like when you inspect skins on the market  I know you can
- - Why do they run Bush  Bell seems to break out long ones pretty consistantly
  - Agreed  it seems like a stupid thing to do  it s probably Jim Caldwell s fault .
- - He only defended her because it s his cousin s girlfriend .
  - Because he was definitely forced to speak out on it .

- - Things more likely than Sweden declaring war .
  - Swedes selling weapons to the country invading them .
- - I do nt think this should be posted . I think you should send it to the mods instead
  - As far as I understand  the original Book of Bork was originally posted as a normal post
- - Is nt God is omnipresent and responsible for everything  Why could nt he  just stop it 
  - I do nt know . But its stupid to blame the actions of humans on to gods . If they exist or not is a different matter altogether .
  - if god can control everything  everything is scripted as per his wishes  how those are humans actions 
  - Maybe he has let humans control their own actions .
  - oh yeah ... then what is god for  and why does his believers think he is controlling their actions and pray them to change it 
  - I am pretty sure they ask him to change things out of their control .

  - I think OP just really wanted to use that phrase and did not care if it made complete sense or not
- - Let s dump all of those to buzzfeed 
  - They already steal it all anyway  it would nt really change much .
- - They log on to complain about bitches that only go for pitbulls and German Shepherds .
  - Why ca nt they go for a nice  loyal labrador like me 
- - You really should make an imgur page with pictures of each shirt and then post the link here
  - Yeah I am interested and tried googling some  but ca nt find them . Pictures would help .
- - That Predator really wants in on the shot .
  - He must have forgot his optic camo  I thought people would be more attentive towards the Street Fighter bikini figurines .
- - It does nt remove it but you should nt take damage  though you need to avoid moving after you blink
  - No actually you need to move immediately after moving so that you exceed the distance count .

  - Hey I m online now  so when you get a chance  let me know if you re online too

  - I do nt know  I zoom in and use it as mine asks it looks sick
- - I foresee lots of quick throws and slants to the likes of Gronk and Edelman  screen passes to Vereen . How they played and beat Detroit  comfortably .

  - Read it  I felt the same way and it really struck me and made me feel a lot better .

  - Playoff at a neutral venue  probably Wembley .
- - I could nt get through it . All the letters all in one spot . Not a grammar nazi or anything but Jesus  spacing is your friend .
  - I had the same problem . But it looks like there s a glitch or something with the website . It s well formatted on mobile . Strange .
- - I do nt fucking understand these people . How does his tweeting a charity event  which may help bump up funds  ruin it

  - Miles is great so long as he does nt touch the ball on offence  and yet our guards actually try to find him when we re attacking .
- - Anderson has been playing unbelievable this season . That being said I would listen to offers if I were Bryan Murray . Some prospects could go a long way .
  - Its Ottawa  the last one that did was Alfredsson
- - If you re breaking out in pimples  wash your sheets and pillowcases more often ... and stop touching your face with your filthy hands .

  - haha  fear the Beaver  ... wait that came out wrong
- - I love it  Watch your kerning though  there s a bit of excess space between a few of the letters .
  - Thanks  kerning was not something I even considered to adjust . Will pay more attention to that
- - And I know he has a few goals now  but he really needs to get an IF . I ll never use another striker if he did  haha .
  - Haha its just a shame they destroyed his pace  he s not that slow in real life 
  - I know he s not  I have no idea why they did that . If I remember correctly  his card last year had more pace .
  - He ll always be a legend and i m glad to see him scoring again and not ruining his legacy at Chelsea
- - I ve got to say  he does that as well as anyone . He can drive and score amazingly well .
  - Yeah that s always been his game  unfortunately  he still has never been able to develop an outside shot .
- - Not very Canadian of them . Just say sorry eh .
  - Well - no firearms or knives were involved  that makes it pretty Canadian . And no one really got hurt .

  - Most freeze well  except for whole potatoes . They are really disgusting to freeze .
- - Moto X does nt have an SD Card slot .
  - Yeah I know . I wish it did because it looks like a solid phone otherwise .
- - Name a country that would be better .
  - Any country that actually has diplomatic relations with North Korea . Switzerland perhaps .
- - Is Brad Pitt referred to as a good actor in general 
  - I certainly hope so . His characters in twelve monkeys  burn after reading and fight club are completely different from each other and he plays them all wonderfully .
  - Is he considered a better actor than Norton  or just more popular 
  - I do nt think so . Norton is an even greater actor . But ofcourse brad pitt is also popular because of his looks .
- - Do nt up vote this . It is nt funny . Get it off the front fucking page
  - Maybe not to you it is nt . I find it original and refreshing
- - strangely all of soviet unions results have been credited to russia

- - Say it with me now  throw away
  - And waste all that karma on a throwaway account  
- - Yet your comment does nt even pertain to the OP s question .
  - The question was already answered when I got here .
- - As someone that s been looking since November  getting those emails are always a good feeling 
  - December of last year here . Engineering grad
- - Winks . Lots and lots of winks .
  - That s my favorite way to argue .
- - I m sure it s not  but I already have Ubuntu set up on mine . Maybe when I get a new machine I ll stick Arch on there .
  - Make sure you read up on the arch documentation then . p
- - Batman  people still do nt know who he is .
  - Toby Maguire  do nt play games .

- - Nop  toriyama confirmed that frieza was a woman
  - I can make stuff up too  Toriyama confirmed that Piccolo is a Yoshi .
- - I m assuming you did nt include Shirley because you re either racist or she intimidates you sexually .
  - Well she s kinda married ... or not 
- - the fact that she was following me around the store to find my husband was a bit crazy .
  - Exactly  and that last time you describe  I would have put my damned hands on her .
- - Wow  this is surprising . Japan has nt already opened a One Piece amusement park 
  - They have stuff at Universal Studios Japan  but this is the first One Piece ONLY park I guess .
- - are denim jackets too dated to wear anymore 
  - No way denim jackets are fly as heck
- - Did you also speak to the Coast Guard 
  - No  there were no coast guard recruiting stations near me .
- - or you know  just have some pride and beat it as intended . it is nt hard .
  - Pride or doing the right thing really has nothing to do with video games unless you are directly competing against someone .
- - I keep looking for it  and there he is . clever one 
  - Thanks  At first the seal was going to be the cigar  but when I pasted it in  it became obvious it had to be the ash .
- - In this analogy I am the car .
  - I know  I was being the funny but also the fail .
- - Fallen probably turned the Light into Ether .
  - If that s true then that s probably what they want with the Traveler  an unlimited supply of Ether .
- - Its like watching a warm up act  without the headliner .
  - Are you suggesting Jon Stewart is the warm up act  Jon Stewart  our most important jew 
- - Yep  they know that certain faggots like you will react by continuing to lie down and protect their shit ideology in the name of tolerance .
  - How am I protecting their ideology  I hate their ideology as much as I hate the xenophobic idiots who exploit attacks like these to spread anger  fear and division .
- - Why is there a girl in a prom dress on the side line 
  - Might have been homecoming . I do nt remember .
- - You do realize this sub is satire  right 
  - Yeah ... But this was nt a quality post nevertheless .
- - Sulphur burns hurt like a bitch . I m guessing lots of intoxicants and embarrassment is the only thing keeping the smile on his face .
  - No booze  but he s more simple than not . Lol .
- - Why could nt Hellen Keller Drive  Because she was a woman .
  - Why ca nt Stevie Wonder read sheet music  Because he s black .
- - It looks like OP was tattooed recently and it s still a bit fresh and red
  - That might be it . To be honest  the skull tattoo just does nt look at all like a bite mark to me .
- - I have a board I work out moves on  I think that s what pretty much everyone does .
  - Okay  so is it basically working out plays and obtaining insight from working it out physically  I take it requires a level of experience for this .
- - You know it s bad when you get shutout and the opposing goalie is only the third star of the game .
  - I m shocked they gave him any star at all . Was Schneider first or second star 
- - Why not  Plenty of high professional sports teams have done it  Turkey and Italy are riddled with it in Football .
  - They have plenty of pc gaming betting sites .
- - SHOULD I BE HAPPY THE TANK TRAIN IS DERAILING RIGHT NOW 
  - Yep  we re gon na go on a however many games are left winning streak and then bring home the cup .
- - Saying your feelings for someone . Once you say it you do not need to dwell anymore .
  - The hardest part of speaking your mind and revealing your emotions is everything leading up to it . It s brutal 
- - I think he was implying that Kompany is the best CB in the EPL . I could be wrong though .
  - Oh . In that case  I would fully agree .
- - How much did you get for your soul 
  - And did it hurt when they took it out 
- - It s beautiful in a photo . But in person  the smell is not quite satisfying .
  - It s often been described as old people
- - Thats pretty terrible for anyone  but Cousins played great on defense . He just has a terrible time against Ibaka . It is his worst match up in the league .
  - Seems like zach randolph always gives cousins trouble by being really physical  that might be worse for him .
- - Sorry if repost  I have nt seen this one before .
  - Please tell me you were nt on site when this happened
- - Great video  Also enjoyed your dog making a cameo at the end .
  - Awesome  thank you  I just added the dry hops yesterday  so will try to get the next video out pretty quick .
- - and valve once again listened to the whiners that cant aim and buffed the stupid CZ ... i hope u are all happy

  - And look at Romo now . Great doctor .
- - Et alors  O est le problme 
  - Idem je vois pas . Cest du Charlie Hebdo ni plus ni moins . Je vois pas en quoi a devrait changer quoi que ce soit .
- - Jealousy lives here  multiple feet of snow here in the Northeast .
  - I m jealous of your snow . We should have several feet by now instead  we have none . It was nt even a proper white christmas .
- - That s either BS or you have terrible luck in this game . Running Nightfalls and VoG should ve net you at least on exotic
  - Not bullshit . I get a ton of legendary drops and exotic armors  but that is my first exotic weapon drop . I ve bought a few from Xur though 
  - Interesting . But surprised you have nt gotten an exotic weapon from VoG chest or killing Atheon
  - Right  I got VoC and Epilogue  as well as the Foil  but that s about it .
- - I have nt run out yet  and I ve been running for a few months
  - Do you just let it run and not answer any questions 
- - Well it was fun while it lasted  silly me for having a sliver of hope .
  - Might as well still hold on to the small hope of us getting two two point conversions .
- - Shit man . That first time you land at night it s like descending into a black hole . It scared me to death  no joke .
  - No jokes  You run a tight ship .
- - To add insult to injury  after losing his job at Woods Hole  he got a job at NASA and then lost it due to budget cuts .
  - I just read that in the article ... Bitterly ironic . He is a brilliant man  though . I hope a project that deserves him gets his attention .
- - Was it an italian guy in NYC 
  - Lol . You d think . An old dude in Texas with an empty barber shop .
- - but that picture is nt of Harry Reid . LOL
  - They were making a joke about Kerry s face .
- - You d be stupid not to be worried . This is the playoffs . Winner take all . We should win  but its never guaranteed .
  - As fans it s okay to be worried
- - Have you ever heard of Nickelback  They ve got some great stuff .
  - I was nt living under a rock sir . But funny comment indeed .
- - Why are your gold mines full but not your elixir collector 
  - Troops cost elixir and not gold so it s easy to keep collecting lix
- - ITT . The exact same opinion opined over and over . The hive mind here is scary sometimes .
  - What opinion are you talking about  and what s wrong with it 
- - bad grapes spoil the bunch  Just look at America .
  - By that logic we might as well nuke every country .
- - That would be like a supermarket putting bread and milk up front . Nope  they put them way in the back so you run the gauntlet of temptations .
  - You sir must have never been to a Wegmans have you 
  - I do nt understand the question and I wo nt respond to it .
  - Wegmans grocery stores likes to keep their milk and bread in the front of their stores .

  - This was not here when I typed my comment . Stupid phone 
- - What did you shave  I am confused

  - Haha i thought so . D I ca nt know more than a moderator . o
- - Very cool  Do you have a favorite thing you ve baked 
  - I make messy looking but fantastic tasting Victoria sponge sandwich  fresh whipped cream and jam in the middle and whipped cream with chopped strawberries on top .
- - I think you re confusing this with the latest season of Homeland .
  - Never seen homeland so maybe it s a coincidence haha .
- - Maybe because they fucking blur too much porn  it creates a lot of apathy and annoyance in me 
  - Really  Japanese porn is terrible  aside from the pixelation  its like a cat skinning contest ... all the screeching .
- - Nice . That s the reason I stopped watching the anime .
  - The last filler arc in naruto was good  colour me optimistic . Just because a story is nt canon it does nt make it bad .
- - Those are so cute  I was going to ask where you got the patterns and my first thought was Sprite Stitch  haha 
  - Thank you very much  Yup yup  my family is filled with geeky people so sprite stitch has always been my go-to for quick stitches haha

- - Thanks  man  I ll be sure to try this out someday .
  - No problem  Maybe I ll do a video or a step-by-step time lapse when I make these sets .
- - why do nt you just drive and draw that foul 
  - Refs would nt call a foul against uk on the last play
- - Wait  you are saying that it s cheaper in Australia for a music service  I never thought I d see the day ... . O
  - In many ways the UK gets screwed more  they tend to love just replacing the dollar price with a pound symbol  effectively adding another half to the US price
- - How about you respond to the tips people here are sharing with you 
  - I like to think he s in a food coma after trying everyone s ideas  and ca nt respond .

- - I love a good slow panning reveal .
  - i was just going to write the same thing  perfect capture
- - Can I change my Chocobo s mount music to my Coeurl s  Coeurl music reminds me of Spyro the Dragon .
  - Not without hacking the game files and modding them . Or getting a rip of the song and playing it elsewhere .
- - What was the last food you ate 
  - A veggie full English breakfast . Although does it count as full  if there s no meat  Who knows .
- - This is most of them . Always on the lookout for more patches and figures of this sort  I ll have to take an updated collection pic soon .
  - Where did you get the galil patch and the figure  I need dis
- - Took a while  but it s risen here .
  - Indeed . Bright blue sky and very sunny here .
- - It s sad that those suburban folks are the most vocal ones on Facebook feeds of news outlets .
  - Are you saying they maybe should stay in their lane 
- - Are you this naive  The whole thing is porn that some people enjoy . There s a lot of it out there .
  - But but but I did nt say I did nt like it ...
- - What is there to learn  Just exhale out your nose ...
  - I would blow all the air out at once and then of course water would rush in
- - And how can you make a post raging at an internet stranger who you ll never meet and consider THAT productive 
  - He s just pissed he s spent thousands of dollars on a game that s starting to suck .
