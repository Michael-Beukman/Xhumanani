- - i think your second point contradicts your first one . for champs purposes if they were to make a change it should be now .
  - There s limits to what team changes they can make right now though due to league rules .
  - ON made a change pretty easily . im pretty sure that if nV wanted to make a change they could

  - I want to say God bless you  but I think it d be better to say God bless us both .
- - Not ripping on Julius Randle  because shit happens and he s suffering from it worse than anyone ... but man  was that injury s timing disappointing or what 
  - Its even worse being a Kentucky fan . Iwas looking forward to seeing him play so much . Especially with how confident and enthusiastic he was coming into the season .

- - Nice  That s about an hour away from where I live  Thanks .
  - My pleasure  go give them your business 
- - Wait why would nt you want the most over face on the roster against one of the two most over heels on the biggest show of the year 
  - Use the same reasoning and that puts Reigns against Lesnar too .
  - Really  Hell  I mean Ambrose and Ziggler are clearly way more over with the crowd than Reigns . Reigns only gets good pops in backwoods ass cities .
  - Reigns won the vote for Superstar of the Year . I think he s the most over with the crowd .

  - And have come out of it knowing we can beat anyone

- - What  you think I did nt get that when I typed it up 
  - Naah  man . Your reflexes are too fast . You caught it .

  - Have you been to ESPN conversations lately  Lel
- - do you use them in public places to measure things  Fuck did you ever pull the entire stack out anywhere in public

- - This sort of thing exists  Skating plus drinking sounds like a really horrible idea . Injuries and whatnot ...
  - Do nt be a square . Grab a bottle and couple skate with me
- - Is that where all the real fuckups get sent 
  - Pretty much . The Supermax is pretty interesting . If you ever get time  you can find some pretty good documentaries on it .
- - Just trying to get ppl to stop giving Gamestop money . They have a bad record of doing things like this .
  - Fair enough  man - I ve heard plenty of bad things about them . Godspeed to you . Sorry about the response  by the way .

  - Then I ll come over be over soon
- - People like you crack me up . how soon white people forget how violent they are .
  - People like you crack me up . How soon people of all ethnicities forget how they re exactly the same as white people .
- - I m sorry that happened to you . Glad you are recovering . Just goes to show not everyone is a good person .
  - Thank you . I agree . I have always been trusting of people and very naive  but I learned my lesson .
- - is that the camera angle or are those holes colored in a glossy black 
  - Gloss black I know I messed up I have flat black that I ll be using
- - My point is that you have never had racial profiling before and never will .
  - You realize you re racially profiling him now 
- - Agree . Still I selfishly hope we get no all-star selections because I do nt want to see those relationships strained by that .
  - I doubt that would strain any relationships  I feel like they d just be happy for each other
- - Do Calvary and The Guest count as under the radar  Two excellent films  particularly Calvary .
  - I think Calvary is relatively unknown . Its one of my favorites of the year .
- - A back story to that title would be dandy
  - Or a shot of the engine bay .
- - sorry  but this is nt allowed here  either .
  - Sorry  I checked the sidebar and saw nothing .
- - Gotcha . So how do you feel about Rango in this current meta 
  - Very strong . Perhaps his strongest . Moment yet Perhaps not jungle  but it s fun . Toplane is noy in his favor but it s winnable .
- - Occasionally  People get mismatched VERY OFTEN  that s the problem .
  - I can only speak from personal experience ; I m EU gold and only happens to me occasionally .
- - Maybe easier searching and archiving of reviews  I like the idea .
  - I would definitely make that an option 
- - If life taught me anything  it s to never expect anything . Screw hope .
  - I guess this is just one of those things you have to learn the hard way .
- - Someone explain to me the proposed law of inmates staying in tents  What purpose would it even serve 
  - Reduces over population . I m alright with it
- - And that will cost a lot of money and time to travel through instead .
  - I know . I am just saying .
- - Love this  Is it stamp or decal  That heart is adorable .
  - Decals  my first time using decals ... i shunned them for a long time
- - Wow I m sorry to hear that . Another injustice with the legal system it seems .
  - That is nt an injustice . People that pull out guns at arguments are criminals . Brandishing a weapon is no small deal .
  - He did nt pull out a gun at an argument  he pulled out a gun when the other person started threatening him and likely would nt leave .
  - You do nt pull out a gun because someone is nt leaving .
- - My death  so I could finally stop worrying about it and live in the present for once .
  - worrying solves nothing to be honest . Be the wonderful person you are now and live in the moment
- - Yes  that would work or use the integrated gpu .
  - So it does nt matter  I just do nt want anything to explode  cause that would be an expensive explosion .
- - Even with yogurt spelled correctly in the meme  this guy still spells it wrong .
  - Pretty sure you can spell it either way .
- - You should really use something with a flared base .
  - The flaired base will stop it from sliding all the way in . Do nt want to become one of those ER stories 
- - Why would you buy them with keys instead of paypal  You will get a better deal . You are right  iTunes cards are more valuable than Steam wallet .
  - I do nt use Paypal  and you re misunderstanding me  what I mean is  Itunes cards is much LESS valuable than Steam Wallet .
- - Those specs look really low . I m quite surprised actually .
  - It was proven fake  do nt believe them .
- - Amazing job  You do the Lord s work  my friend .
  - Thanks . I could have never compiled all of these facts and did all of the debate with those clowns without this sub . This is a group effort .
- - Yes so its more like a TV watching experience . Im glad I m not the only one who thought this
  - Why would I want to watch netflix like I Watch TV 
- - Redbull is my friend . I may have to pick one up now 
  - It s definitely a cure-all . The caffeine helps with migraines too 
- - I do nt see the harm in asking . I may or may not do it depending on what it is . But sure  you might as well ask .
  - I only see a problem if they insist that it be done right then .
- - I guess I feel effort should be put into that archive instead of mucking about ... Silly posts are obstructing it ...
  - Well hopefully we get some new good information soon 
- - I read it LOL . But if you ask me that I ll surely draw you into enough conversation to make you buy artwork off of my online Etsy store . XD
  - I love shopping on etsy  What s your shop 
- - Just received my Hogue coco bolo checkered grips today . They are super easy to install and fit perfectly . Much better fit for my hand than the factory grips .
  - Nice grips . Congrats . From one cz fan to another 
- - do you think this means they re definitely going to be upgraded 
  - i m honestly not sure  but if i had to guess i d say this is a glitch that comes from their already determined upgrades  yeah .
  - Let us know if they ever change back because if they do then im sure that means they ll both get upgraded
  - It s just their in game ratings . It happens to every IF
- - Why would it be awkward  people would just assume it s a child singing
  - I agree . It s not awkward so much as cute or really  really annoying .
- - Awesome  thanks  Nude is a great song ... in fact  almost all the songs on that album could be mentioned here .
  - Chino also has a third band called crosses . Their whole album is chill  although I think I enjoy team sleep more .
- - Yes or no to white  high-top converses 
  - Pretty classic  basic item . Hard to go wrong with them .
- - Presumably he s describing his own insecurities more than the actual critical or popular reaction to him .
  - That s what I figured . To me it just comes off as self-deprecating in a way that feels dishonest .
- - Texas is nt the problem for them . They re trying to shut dow all the fracking happening in North Dakota and other states .
  - You re misinformed  there is more fracking going on in Texas than anywhere else .
- - Buffalo Wild Wings has all UFC events and there is no cover . I have no idea why more people do nt know about that .
  - Are you able to hear the commentary and fight while being at such a large and inhabited place 
- - Huh . Do they have these in other countries 
  - Not the ketchup ones . Or at least they re very hard to find .
- - Well you re modding ... So it should be easy to get loot . lol .
  - what does that mean and how can you tell 
- - I thought he would be more of a dick when reading the post earlier but he really just only avoided questions about himself while complementing his teammates .
  - I bet his PR told him to say great win so they couldnt twist any of his words if he had given a genuine response . Good PR imo
- - That s the ugliest cat I ve seen .
  - But it s one of the cutest pugs in the world .
- - It requires an FAU ID to open it  so nobody can see it .
  - EDIT . Fixed it  hopefully you guys can see it now 
- - I d cast Adlo and then stab myself with a fork .
  - Critical hit  Damages more than adlo shield . P
- - It s probably much harder  but a degree in game design seems like something pretty helpful too  considering that s the subject .
  - Yeah man that s what I was hoping 
- - Really pretty eyes . Are you planning on coloring them 
  - Thanks  I ve tried coloring and I m not very good . I ll stick to what I know .
- - Thank you I ll look into it 
  - My pleasure . Great books for sure .
- - That s because I do nt care . It s cute when you get all worked up .
  - If you like getting me worked up  then you should nt have said so .
- - It should nt ignore shields because taking shields down is still useful . But if it damaged shields and the enemy at the same time that would be very great .
  - I was thinking that perhaps it could do elemental damage to any type of shield .
- - ehh  lets see first how they perform against RhyThm . D
  - they rekt them  they only lost rounds because steel was scratching his back or something i watched jdm s stream they got this eZ
  - This . Absolutely destroyed Rhythm even though Steel played pretty shitty and that says a lot since he is their best player by far IMO .
  - Steel played far from shitty . You must have missed his pistol round clutch . He was playing really well .
- - Pitt . Why would someone want to go to a school with a culture of child rape 
  - Because I m not going to stereotype a school based off the isolated incident of a few sick individuals 
- - And why do you think they could nt attract major publishers 
  - They had a bad launch  they did everything wrong besides generate hype on kickstarter . People lost faith early in the game and they never recovered .
- - Using so many words to say basically nothing at all  that s some talent right there .
  - That s how I feel when trying to hit a word count minimum for a paper .
- - FUCK  New Jack is a piece of shit 
  - I mean you do nt tell New Jack you invented hardcore wrestling  thats just not safe for your health .
- - I refuse to believe thats Jaws jump is real . No horse would go past that shit . Hell i wouldnt .
  - They ll go over it though  Crazy deer leap is always recommended when something looks bitey .
- - Valus is the only one feeling powerful this week
  - Valus is nt even all that powerful  it s just that all the mobs are a royal pain to deal with -- instead of actually being fun to play against .
- - Bastion and Battleblock Theater made me smile a lot .
  - William Stamper has a voice of gold .
- - I tried doing that but it just keeps asking me to add an account .
  - You have to add BOTH accounts  your main and your throwaway  in order to switch back and forth .
- - That sounded wrong in the context of balls . P
  - That s where I was going with it . LOL You win some  you lose some .
- - Get rid of the excess flippers maybe 
  - which ones  The jet engines  Oh  the rectifiers  I ll see if One is enough .
- - I wanted a mechanical keyboard that is full size  looks good and is good to type and game with . Does the CM Storm Quickfire Rapid fit this 
  - XT is the full sized version of Rapid and depends on your taste of switches when it comes to typing and gaming .
- - Huh  when I said it should have been a penalty you did nt seem to be happy with that either .
  - I do nt see you saying that anywhere . The closest I see is when you say it could have  but should not have in your opinion .
- - Work has cut into my bowl watching schedule this year unfortunately
  - I can tell already I m going to hate adult life
- - So  essentially  give all friendly characters Windfury for one turn 
  - With added bonus of end of turn effects gaining an additional proc . ex . Rag  Ysera
- - How can they give it to you if you do nt have internet  Are they going to mail it to you homeboy 
  - i can download things to my phone . Also have a work computer  okay  Dang . Again relevance 
- - Is this your own content  Remember link posts are only for sharing your own original content . Also  naming and shaming is a bit of a dick move .
  - Yeah I dont know about this  sort of a dick move .

- - The ability to read minds . All of the minds . All at once .
  - Reminds me of that Fairy Odd Parents episode . Everyone think your favorite candy  Scream it in your head

  - A joke . Look at that sexy megaman .
  - That sexy Mega Man certainly is no joke .
- - And that hand tap was pretty slick too .
  - Seriously . That entire operation would crush me .

  - If you ve never seen the movie Nebraska  I highly recommend it .

- - Glad I m not the only one who catches that vibe . Also  is she in love with Adnan  Maybe just a little 
  - Seriously  What is with people accusing any female  who does nt immediately think Adnan is guilty  of being in love with him 
  - It s not that she does nt think he is guilty . It s that she s started an obsessive campaign to free him .
  - If she believes he s innocent  she s right to start an obsessive campaign to free him . She s wrong to conduct it the way she has .
- - In a perfect world  this would be normal .
  - I so agree . I wish I could walk around naked at my leisure . Ugh . Modern convention be damned .
- - That s about Venezuela  not Putin .

  - Also  chiropractors are the ppl that think they can heal sicknesses and crap by popping your back .
- - You realise that your question is racist  right  Or at the very least xenophobic .
  -  Where do people experience or cause more racism 
- - You ever wonder what these people would complain about if all white  hetero people just disappeared forever 
  - Well they would also disappear so they do nt really get anything
- - Again  this is a locked down work phone . Software is not interchangeable and this is software that Samsung wrote specifically for this phone .
  - Samsung did nt lock it down . This is nt the fault of the phone .
- - They have to . You want scores  in depth analysis  or highlights  You get it instantly and as a result espn has switched towards what we see today
  - so true . it s the same way our news coverage in general has changed . the internet has changed so much about our lives .
- - And no tourist is going to the Bronx
  - Except to see a Yankees game during the summer .
- - I also agree with other posters that you should pay her the money you promised . I feel this would go someway in restoring the trust you broke .

  - Many excellent passes and layoffs to opposition forwards .

  - Maybe it s some dated word that s no longer used in modern Russian . I ve never heard of it before .
  - Have nt heard about it either  just tried to translate it in Google Translate and got this  yea . v
- - Why would you need a disguise  Who s going to know you re a process server 
  - they do it in the movies  seth rogan does it in pineapple express and it looked fun

  - That s the thing  I ve escaped in those situations before .
- - i did this once  drove a mile before the engine broke down .
  - I got to my parking lot and engine started jerking  thought i threw a rod thankfully it was nt .
- - And then he turned out to be missing and most likely dead  Oh jesus christ
  - He did nt want to face our wrath .
- - i think Carolina was asked last year after the Capital One bowl and we said no then
