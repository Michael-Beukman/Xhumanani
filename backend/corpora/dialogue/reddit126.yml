  - Oh for sure  I misread your comment .
- - I bet he tried to suck on it  did nt he

- - Except real sports have no problem with trash talk  as long as they dont call out for cheating or arranging games or something like that .

  - Sometimes silly jokes are the best jokes  pal .
- - I would nt blame you for converting to a cheesehead  but mad respect that you have nt .
  - No man should ever turn his back on his team based on record .

  - Considering the bumper and mirror covers are plastic  you might be right there  Sherlock .
- - A far stretch from being an artisan  Where is the skill  the fine attention to detail  and the high quality uniqueness of the items being crafted 
  - I mean look at what he s got ...
- - I feel like Koufos and Tayshaun and a second would be enough to pull Green . What do you or Celtics fans think 
  - I d be over the moon about that  which probably means we d have to attach a draft pick unless I m completely overselling Koufos .
- - Although not many Alabama and Buckeyes fans want to admit  both fans are a little if not hugely worried about their opponent . I m worried about Alabama .
  - Fantastic . Take it to your own thread .

  - Putting children s clothing on backwards is actually hilarious in some situations .

  - and just like that poof it s gone . P
- - My third GRAD launch link ... I guess this is a thing now .
  - Do you have any videos of when they hit also 
- - Sorry  by busy work  I meant all that extra work  that s not really any harder except for their is a ton more of it .
  - I do agree with the not any harder except more of it part . I took a couple of those AP classes where it was worksheet after worksheet .
- - This is a friend s order from Toys R Us that he just received today . I m just karma whoring his pain .
  - Ha  I just had the same thing today 
- - Eh  it was more of a comment on how inflammatory the linked title was .
  - It s not so inflammatory . No one knew until they got him down he was nt armed with a real pistol .
- - it s the tramp stamp that gives him power .
  - I heard it lights up every time he choke slams someone  but it s always away from the hard cam .
- - that was the luckiest connect of the year so far

  - Interesting ... Since that would also cause the truck to overturn .
- - What s the point of howling at the moon if you re not even in a forest  Sounds pretty inconsiderate towards the other guests
  - Right . It makes so much more sense in a forest .
- - Yeah but if nobody buys GSync monitors and Freesync wins out as a cross-platform alternative then Nvidia will probably support it
  - Sadly  only then . So this is the outcome we should be working towards .
  - If in fact FreeSync works as well as G-Sync  has anybody even compared a Freesync monitor yet 
  - For one  the function is very basic . As long as it works at all  it s worth it over tying your monitor to your video card brand .
- - Nice username . I m on like book ten ATM .
  - That means you have made it trough the dark times and the next four are similar in pace to the first three  hahaha

  - You ll see more kitchen scenes than the Fate and UBW routes .
- - Bloodbraid Elf and Ancestral Vision are the only ones I could see them plausibly unbanning .
  - on the other hand they would never unban AV if they ban TC in the same move .
- - I just question what goes through a man s mind when he decides to tell someone that .

  - It is nt different states  just different cities
- - If you re clean when you get out of the shower then why is the towel dirty after you use it once

  - It s currently in Unstable  Seems pretty stable to me  you should really check it out

  - Im running it on my car stereo .

- - Tell me what I need to eat to make my hair grow faster 
  - Look into taking biotin supplements . It works for some people .

  - It was nt  but the raids remain fun and I ll keep playing them .
- - Well I m not going back anyways if that makes you feel better
  - It does nt make me feel better or worse . I have no emotional investment in this .
- - I have to say the short shots are the best exhaust for the slim
  - Thanks  I have to agree . Personal opinion of course - but I just feel like they follow the natural lines of the bike very well .
- - the Sola salt cave has an amazing sensory deprivation tank and it is off Eagle Street downtown or at least it was last summer
  - I will definitely have to try that  that looks amazing 
- - I m located in Wisconsin . I just checked at Revzilla and they have it marked as available on their product page .

  - The blackness  it s every where  Dad  Is that you 
- - I ca nt decide if this is actually quality or just a shit post .
  - Wait for people to decide for you .
- - Dumbed down  Have you even played vanila 
  - Pretty sure he is talking about vanilla . It was far more casual friendly  more forgiving and less grind heavy or tedious than it s predecessor MMOs at the time .
- - Where do you get grasshoppers in bulk  in the winter 
  - Go down to your local feed store or any pet store . They re dirt cheap .
- - He wo nt have a shot at winning and he wont be on the TV or radio anymore . Its a win win for everyone else .

  - Got the caps done a few weeks ago actually . Probably going to play with him for a bit and see how he feels
- - Do you shoot for a certain percentage reduction on your cutback weeks  Or do you just run what you feel for those weeks 
  - I do nt really structure my cutback weeks based on some regimented schedule . They typically just happen when my legs are feeling tired and I dial my mileage back accordingly .
- - Do you think you can elaborate on that for those that do nt know what you mean 
  - You can induce lag so all your damage on a target resolves at once . Or so you warp and are difficult to hit .
  - Is it one way or two way 
  - Both . You can throttle down the upload and download independently . So you could do both at once if you wanted .
- - Did anybody seriously think they would play 
  - I thought Lance Thomas might have had a chance to stay on the roster .

- - Top gear should not be taken as an unbiased car review show . Its a car comedy show
  - With AMAZING cinematography . It s basically car porn .

  - Awesome  Message me a little about yourself  I just want to make sure she s going to a good place .
- - Why do they never let people vote on stuff but let them vote on this 
  - I have no idea what you are trying to ask .
- - Why is this news  Its a non-issue . Like seriously .
  - Just like Scalise scandal is a non-issue . Everyone knows Republicans are racists and homophobes anyway 
- - Excellent points . I do love those Mustang and Camaros  myself .
  - Me  I m hot for the Challenger .
- - Well the hotel does not own any of the right spectrum . The US public owns it .

  - Are you one of those prison muslims 
- - No one has said our legal system is perfect . But even defense attorneys acknowledge that the rights of the accused in this country are extensive .
  - On the presumption they do their jobs correctly . Me if I do nt want to kill someone I m doing in in Scandinavia .
- - Sharp edged metal utensils in a non stick pan ... this will get you murdered in my kitchen .
  - Jacques  pans are ceramic bottom  I believe . Metal utensils are nt as big a deal as on Teflon coated crap .
- - A rigged coin  You get to call it in the air  so that s an invalid point .
  - He catches it . The toss may be rigged  the coin may not be .
- - If you re playing Meepo correctly and you have a quick Heart and Aghanim s your clones should have more than enough health to survive Jugg ult .
  - Fair enough . I never play him  so I would nt know  just that every time I ve seen him  all of his clones were squishy .

- - Never seen a newbie even go near the weights let alone not re-rack . This is bollocks .
  - I get the feeling you ve never seen the inside of a gym before . That  or you have a home gym .
- - There are ZERO easy games in the Big East this year .
  - its always been like that for us .
- - Jesus  Cahill is sure one dumb fuck
  - Yep . Time to unleash Zouma I think
- - Yes  the CRTC are a bunch of old people who think they know what us Canadians want ... I want American Netflix  not fucking Nickelback on my radio ...
  - Its not about what we want its about giving Canadian bands and tv shows a chance to develop a fan base in a mostly Americanized market .
- - Damn . I only know one other person who draws this well with pencil and chalk . It always smudged for me  so I stuck to digital .
  - I stick to digital now . The quicker workflow is great but I do miss traditional methods . Thanks

- - At least tell us which one you got
  - The one all the way at the bottom of the post that says Room for extra cards
- - The joke is that HoTS released the pool party pack and mounts before the game is even released . Hence the ridiculous image of Stiches on a tiny purple unicorn .

  - I was nt gon na drink after this game  but that s now definitely happening .
- - Why does WWE never upload Raw or Smackdown to the Network 
  - They have to wait a month . Hulu contracts

  - Thanks  man . Glad to see other meatheads partake .
- - Sorry  what are you are trying to say  It s not very clear .
  - I think OP is trying to say that you know the truth  you re out  so walk away and pretend it never happened . But I could be wrong .
- - I think it depends on the person a lot . I have no problems remembering all that stuff from Pokemon but I still have trouble remembering how magic works for example .
  - yeah  thats probably true  despite all i said above  never fully played a pokemon game
- - How is he holding the site hostage 
  - This is the important part . Do you have logins to everything and is the domain in your name 
- - I really do nt think the arched power brow is for everyone .
  - This . You ca nt force an arch if you do nt have one naturally . Plus I think straight brows are gorgeous on their own .

  - Maybe they were just too lazy to buy laxatives and it was easier just to print this up 
- - Yeah  I was just making a Clerks reference .
  - Doh  I should have caught that . Have nt seen it for years  need to do that .
- - Uh  well ... where are you in your career 
  - I want to be an architect . I ve done the engineer and team lead stuff enough .
- - Well  no one predicted the show to crash and burn as an utter trainwreck  yet that happend .
  - This show is by no way a master piece  but nor is it a trainwreck . It s a more or less average mecha show .
- - Keep using your jump scripts man . If you need help for your lack of skill that s fine by me .
  - You keep playing your matchmaking bud . When you finally get out of silver  we ll talk CS .
- - Why  Does she sell a lot of product to practicing Muslims 
  - She s a tourist visiting a beautiful mosque . Why are you confused 
- - Should have requested a team when I had the chance
  - can still request  i m just bored at home
- - What bits are cut  Nobody tells me nuthin around here

- - Did the shelter know what happened to her eye  Also  her disability does nt diminish the beauty of her smile at all

- - But if you live in Colorado you get the altitude training  so you got that goin for ya
  - Yeah  everyone in Colorado is high .
- - Did the front of your car hit something 
  - ya  I was in the middle of the chain of cars
- - The revolting overly sweet taste of Nutella seems to be at least equally widely held of an opinion as the love of Nutella .
  - It can only be tolerated with peanut butter .
- - I had a harder time in summer camp than I did in boot camp .
  - THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE  SIR 
- - The Hobbit . But you know ... as a single movie . For kids . With only characters from the book . And shot in real locations with limited cgi .
  - I totally agree  I m not impressed by how it was done previously .
- - Udyr with the spirit guard icon  but he is using the primal skin . That way you know he s not screwing around .
  - I thought I am the only one doing that LOL . D
- - The evidence would also likely show your mom to be a big fat crack whore
  - That s his daughter  mom is hooked on a cocktail of xanax and chardonnay .
- - Only if you sucked me back you fat nerd
  - You used the insults I use I m not impressed
- - oh man cheese bacon sour cream cream cheese these are a few of my favorite things .
  - It s so good . It gets devoured every time I make it
- - Your silent sarcasm is nt going to go over well with this crowd . Shocked nobody has replied back to ask how much character growth a baby could have  yet .
  - Honestly at first I thought he meant someone else  and then I was like oh . sarcasm nice .
- - They should now start anonymously informing the police and government of the radicals in the mosques .
  - Ideally . Realistically . More lip service .
- - I wish you good luck  but it will be tough .
  - It certainly wo nt be easy . But with your help  and the help of our peers  I believe it is an effort worthwhile .
- - Oh  maybe I will pass then . I was able to manage SS and SS . Delta because the AI was competent .
  - As someone who also plays SS . D  I agree . AI partners much more useful in that game .
- - NES you gave Papa our location . You re playing a very strange game .
  - Was it him  That was my guess too .
- - That s how I felt while watching the draft this year and realizing everyone passed on HHCD and it was our pick .
  - Yeah  same . I was wanting him more than anyone else  we needed some help in secondary .
- - Just to clarify  you think that two plans that cost the same are incomparable ... why 
  - Either it is a service cut for the same cost  or a service increase for increased cost .
  - And according to that description  the former is more comparable than the latter . For the same amount of money  you get less service .
  - Sure  but that does nt make claims that it is both a service cut and a price increase any less disingenuous .
- - is it relevant at all  how 
  - Because you are forcing this . Its a very old book written by people there are no hidden codes or references to events that havent happened .
- - Larry Sanders is out  so how do you feel about Pachulia  Then I could look at possibly upgrading either Henderson or Mayo .
  - ZaZa vs a terrible pacers front court - sold .
- - Honestly  his best bet for stress-free survival is just to be let go .
  - I fed him a small rat pink and released him into my garden
- - Thanks man but its fine . Thats freedom of speech man and I d hate to be without it 
  - It s just makes me mad I feel like there s already a lot of ignorance towards Islam and people are exploiting this opportunity pretending to be some type of freedom fighter
- - You can have a negative balance on almost all bank accounts .
  - But they charge you fees  and in some cases if your overdraft does nt cover it it ll bounce . What I m arguing is a very normal practice
- - you have a Howl skin and that shitty laptop 
  - thinking might be required to get a basic jist of whats actually being said ...
- - I dont think she is physically stronger than he is . In the books he was described as kind of a gorilla or something like that .
  - GRRM has said that Brienne is nearly the size of the Hound  and Jaime remarks that she is stronger than him .
  - That shes stronger than the Hound  That doesnt seem right .
  - No  slightly smaller in appearance . Hound is still stronger . Still  the list of people stronger than Jaime is nt exactly long .
- - Is there anyway to tell on Spotify  I put them in as local file because i hate iTunes .
  - Just using spotify  No  unfortunately .
