  - Not offended at all . Kinda embarrassed I commented without watching though .
- - Crepes with Nutella and bananas is my favorite feel better breakfast

- - I m saying actors are nt good sources . Anecdotal evidence would nt hold up in the lab .
  - What better of a source get can you get than one from inside the industry itself

  - Funny  but not the same . Without a steering wheel you ca nt turn . Without a pick you can still strum .
- - UK here  we say it also . I suspect every English speaking country does .
  - I ve never heard an English person say it . It s one of those little things that makes me irrationally angry when I hear or read it .
- - boo fucking hoo . Elect terrorists  do nt be surprised when you get bombed .
  - Palestine would have been fucked any way even if Hamas never existed . Israel also bomb without really aiming for terrorists but rather children

  - But Coleman  But I would love to see some exotic formations with the two fullbacks and beast . D-lines would nt know who to come at .
- - Oh bullshit  if they get in trouble for this and the ducks do nt for holding a practice for damns sake ...
  - Why could they get in trouble for this 
  - NHL teams are nt supposed to do anything around Christmas time  to allow the players to spend time with their family and friends .
  - But they are grown ups and can make their own decisions right 
- - As a music fan  a good stereo and good headphones .

  - Yeah  that s right . Does nt make it any less painful prior to the reset  though .
- - How is it hurting you  You would nt even know about it if they did nt tell you .
  - Because that s my government breaking the law and because it s my information they are taking in violation of that law .
