  - I thought he was seen as pretty much staple in every late game lock deck these days .
  - Actually many Hand locks are starting to use him less  because its an insta loss against harrison .
- - Mignolet has been fine  Fuck up about him .
  - He got no one near the second one .

  - Og I didnt know about this . Link by chance

  - I like piper more than marco tbh .

  - I did nt even think he could yell that loud
- - Dust off your skanking docs because ska is due for a comeback soon 
  - Everybody s doing the Fish . Yeah yeah yeah .
- - No you do nt . At least around here they tend to get shut down by the health department a lot . And it s way overpriced .
  - The Steak n Shake s around St. Louis are very  very affordable compared to most fast food places .
- - The trick is to arc your back so hard it becomes a standing bench press .
  - Get into a limbo stance TM and literally benchpress it for the best gains . If you have the mobility go for decline press .
- - Why does the blue look so ... blue 
  - I may also be wrong but if OP is playing on Mac  it handles brightness differently and gives the game a blue tint instead .

- - How would CS Go run on this PC  I am a peasant .
  - I m not a peasant and I m so curious 
- - Link to article please  I ca nt find it anywhere
  - As far as I know  the article is not online . It is in this month s issue of Alternative Press .
- - Because that s not something they can legally broadcast . It s a death . It s implied what happens .
  - I saw Shephard Smith on Fox live broadcast a car theif shooting himself in the head . It happens
- - Was there any cream or sugar in it 
  - He was at Starbucks so it was all sugar .
- - Protip . Mildy NSFL is called NSFW  retard .
  - Yeah ... and I do nt even think this is particularly nsfw . Just kinda gross .

  - Your son could be the star of a show called Kids I Do nt Care About .
- - These people really want to be the victim so hard .
  - You could even say that maybe GGers need to grow a thicker skin and stop being offended over every little thing .
- - What happens if it happens over and over again every day

- - I m still psyched that you used one of the many name ideas I gave ya .

  - Do nt say that . Let s think some happy thoughts .
- - I m glad Elle called themselves out on the fact they do this as well as everyone else .

  - Im toying with a men are more focused women more multi in their thinking  thus women looked more places generally . Not a terrible hypothesis .

  - Which is illegal in many places It also means they do nt have police powers or immunity
- - Natural . Super long and harsh winter Economical . dollar crash U.S. . food shortages  societal breakdown  etc Globally . global change on a dramatic scale

  - Knowing the girl personally I know it s not  but I see how you could see it that way . Remove if you wish
- - Sometimes we must choose a side . Even if its the wrong one .
  - That s interesting . Not entirely interesting but it has promise .
- - I took that to mean that they ll be running so much they re puking at the next practice .
  - That s what I figured . They re getting punished for getting filmed and being embarrassing . Run dem steps .
- - Either to much or not enough cotton . Dry usually not enough  Chalky to much or its to much flavoring in the juice which can cause muted flavor
  - I see  I see . I m going to re-wick right now and use a lot less cotton and see if it helps . Thanks 
- - They showed one of these on a top gear episode . We need more of these about 
  - I just see it not maintaing the sounds very long after years of use
- - If you want to be a sniper you must learn to slice the pi .
  - Because slicing the tau does nt make any sense .

  - But what does it mean by Forever 
- - It happened so fast that originally I thought it was someone in the back of the room that shot her .

- - Can they even hurt him  In my Batman vs Snorlax thread most agreed that Bats could nt even hurt him through physically attacks .
  - They do nt have to hurt him  he s the attacker . If he ca nt beat his opponent it counts as a loss for him .
- - You have nt proved anything as far as I am concerned . I still this this theory  whether it is yours or someone else s  is complete fantasy .
  - I think it s complete bullshit as well  I was simply explaining it to you since you did nt seem to understand what he was saying somehow .
- - Was anyone else irrationally annoyed by the fact that the letters did nt appear to the beat of the alphabet song

  - Flower is kill doto is kill . Puppet is dark

- - This reminded me to go back and finish House of Cards .
  - I should watch that . Like  the implications of you saying that make me feel like it more now . Thank you . Not sarcastically .
- - I think quality beats cheap by a little bit
  - That s why we have mechanical keyboards .

  - The wear on it really pushes me away from wanting it  that combined with it being a gut knife  which I m not really a fan of .
- - This looks rad  but for that much money I d just by a nvidia shield instead
  - Makes sense  you have to be sensible with your money .
- - Never chop trees down . Logs are pointless . Chopping down a tree damages your axe much quicker than chopping kindling  and you can start a fire with kindling .
  - Well  there is enough splitting axes around nowdays . So I do nt care too much . Sometimes I cut a tree  sometimes I get kindling .
- - Got a bit lucky Defour scored just in time but still a phenomenal result

  - they do nt trust their soloQ . Yet the only permanent swap that is still in place is Kiwi as support  and there are plenty of better soloQ supports .
- - Spartans and Horned Frogs are bros for life . That was so satisfying to see Baylor lose exactly how we lost to them . Amazing comeback for the ages .
  - Both teams have come along way since the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl . I ve been cheering for TCU ever since .
