  - You ca nt even see the aiming  other than the tracers of that one guy who could nt hit the T  but everyone has those moments .

- - Kohli the little cunt I really really dislike him
  - Cmon cobber do nt be so sour .

- - I m sorry I m still pissed off at the Tebow burning Ike .
  - at least you were nt in the stadium when it happened  walking out of there really sucked
- - I m a Ford guy but a black on silver Chevy looks pretty sharp . Sweet truck man .

- - oh hell  next week we ll have NXT Lucha and TNA  that s going to be a full night .
  - TNA moves to Friday  I think .

  - I graduated before the ACA was passed  so the extension to stay on your insurance did nt apply to me .
- - I have no clue since I do nt have a device with Touch ID
  - I do  and would be glad to assist if needed .

  - The capybara contingent always has to get a word in .
- - Why  So you can skip the deathsinger 
  - Do you have an Atheon HM CP then 
  - Why  So you do nt have to do any of the work yourself 
  - Are you currently at the end of the Daily Heroic  Sure could use some shards .
- - Cam is running himself out of the NFL . Ca nt be good long term for him .
  - Cam needs an intervention from Wilson . Needs to become less bull in china shop and more greased up deaf guy who slides .
- - My dogs name is Butters  get used to people loving your dog s name .
  - My best friend named his golden retriever Butters too  But I think he was referencing the south park character

  - I do nt get this one . Can someone please explain  Thanks 
- - In that case  I m firmly behind poop equality .
  - I do nt think you really wan na be behind that
- - I would think that would almost exonerate Jay . That would imply he never saw the body at all .
  - Except if that s true  it s hugely troublesome that he lied about having seen it at least four times .
- - Going to a shelter on a bad day is like going to the grocery store when you re really hungry .
  - I know  it was so tempting ...
- - Are you good at programming  or analyzing data with Excel 
  - I ve never really done that . But I think I d like to .
- - The fact that he leaves . Just passed you up and left . Had me rolling .

- - so far  this is not possible . If we could use selectors or JSON in nbt  this would be very possible .
  - Thanks for the quick reply  I ll stop trying to do it then haha . D
- - With the number of secondary issues we have  I m sure we could use an assistant to the secondary coach .
  - Our secondary is bad because of Troy  because of Mike being new  and mostly because of an insane lack of a pass rush .
- - Not exactly in the wild though . Looks like a hollow shell compared to the other one .
  - Looks a lot more alive than the majority of them .
- - Actually yea  it got really cold over the last couple days .
  - It might just be the cold weather .
- - Taj is playing like complete ass right now
  - He s honestly been like this all season . A lot of people in this sub dont want to admit hes not that great .
- - Are there any writings of direct questions and answers with him 
  - Not really . The Gospels and the Epistles of Paul tell us what he roughly told the disciples after he was resurrected though . Paul became a Christian after hearing Jesus
- - I never said they all were . But for some reason you think they should all have useless educations
  - So which MPs should have post-secondary educations and which one s should nt 
  - I do nt care if any of them do . Leadership is not a quality taught today in Canadian Universities
  - Then yours and mine experiences were very different  I suppose .
- - I would teach yourself before you go instead  just my thoughts .
  - They could make good progress if they studied every day  but ultimately I think an intensive course in Sweden would still be a the preferred choice  no 
- - Believe it or not  Thomas was a lot worse  especially in practice . He threw plenty of INTS and errant passes .
  - I guess they were fucked either way .
  - Yeah  that happens when you lose your first two quarterbacks .
  - Not to mention their first two RB s .

- - The difference between Luongo and Montoya is pretty evident .
  - Luongo thinks he s batman right now though .
- - What time do we play Stunnr  Because there s no way we re losing Comeback Uplink .
  - Kind of bummed that we got both Retreat HP and Comeback Uplink in this match cause that means we wo nt get either of those against STNNR .
- - Can confirm . you will freeze if you get a shower . Source . I just got out of the shower
  - I knew it  That s it  No work today 
- - So  never live in Gotham unless you are a ghostbuster .
  - Pretty much . Gotham is a good contender for the worst city to live in  in all fiction
  - Over a hundred issues  counting spin-offs . And I like spin-offs . They kinda give scale to events .
  - Yeah . Especially with No Mans land spinoffs are pretty important .
- - That s why it s frustrating . They re playing some of the best hockey they ve played all season and because of that one stupid call they re losing .
  - and we have played shitty hockey and won with it .
- - nope  it is nt peasantry to choose your own food .
  - Haha  I know I just wanted to post something different from all the other peasantry posts . . P

- - Not sure why you got down voted  this is the only name I have for this kind of thing .
  - It s a new one for me  I ve only heard them been called extension leads or extension cord  but everyday s a school day
- - You ca nt really fault a company for trying to make money  The Color of the Year is meant to catalog tastes via beauty and fashion .
  - I know . But it just feels contrived and hyped to me  which bothers me on some level so I avoid it .
- - I would watch the fuck out of this .
  - pffft  the hypothetical book is better .
- - Have you ridden the Longbeard yet  Or are you simply tingling with anticipation 
  - I m shaking with it . I m not gon na ride it until I have the ideal components .
- - Hardly a crime  She s a stupid and nasty woman but calling the police in is a waste of everyone s time .
  - They re using this law on trivial things until people stop paying attention and start thinking it s normal  then they re going to really roll out the big guns .
- - Looks like your dog found a dead deer and took a few bites before you showed up with your camera .
  - My dog had two encounters with moose . The blood was everywhere . It does nt look to me like this dog took down that animal .
- - and this happened with ur old GPU also  how did u resolve the problem with ur old GPU 
  - Yes  it happened from time to time . I did nt and it just gave me an excuse to upgrade my gpu .
- - Ladies be checkin out that upper arm and men are full elbow .
  - Hey  Do nt dis that elbow 
- - I can never tell if Mix s tweets make no sense on purpose or he actually ca nt write in English .
  - I thought some of the awkwardness of his earlier tweets were language issues but who knows wtf this is
  - Can confirm that Mix speaks very good english but that does nt mean he can write it out just as well
  - My spoken Spanish is definitely much better than my written Spanish .
- - Damn  it d be hard to think of a combination more OP than that .
  - If I recall correctly  he was one of the few characters that knew that the Marvel and DC universes had merged .
- - Was the car purchased in your name with her as a loan co-signer 
  - I think it s in both of our names .

- - They re all more drunk on the liquor than fuckin  Lahey over there  too 
  - Ha  I never expect to see a Trailer Park Boys reference here  Being a Canadian Im obligated to love the show .

  - It s missing a number of key storybrooke scenes  but this is still pretty good if you do nt want to watch OUAT .
- - Are there any g-sync monitors worth getting right now

  - Dude  please try to be a better person . Comments like this are nt criticism  they re insults .

  - this worked for me after uninstalling and restarting  then installing again .
- - I am always nice . I even make sure my husband has his peach bellini and prosecco . P
  - I do nt know what any of that is  but I d probably drink it too . You re amazing .
- - I do nt think you ll be able to feel your leg .
  - I would nt be able to anyways during sp ...
- - The U.S. version is way more confusing  I can see how OP fell for that .
  - It s really not . To an American .
- - That link says nothing about a law suit  and I ca nt find any evidence for it online . Is this a weak troll attempt 
  - how is it weak if it worked on you 
  - maybe because it did nt have a gotcha moment the way the video does . it just diffuses into a kind of uneasy confusion .
  - yeah  i went to the trivia section to see if it mentioned the lawsuit . It would have been better to link to a gif page  maybe

- - The looks I get at work when I m sat eating chicken  rice and veg for breakfast . Soz it s not Coco Pops .

  - I agree . They actually look totally different to me .
- - It s preponderance of the evidence  not balance of probabilities  right 
  - Not in my jurisdiction as well as most common law jurisdiction  no . They mean the same thing though .

  - Did you really have to comment this five times 
- - Thanks  maybe I think I ll do a quick bit with it installed to get my bearings and then have a go with it disabled because you ve said that .
  - I would advice against it to be honest . There are lots and lots of ways to get huge amount of gold without using exploits anyway .

  - she totally cut a heel promo on last weeks nxt though

- - He s not  you idiots . He s making the same point all of you are .
  - and they re satirizing it to get the better of gullible dudes like you .
- - It s a charmander . Flame on tail went out and he consequently died and became cubone .
  - That s what I believe too  The body shape is too much of a coincidence .
- - I think they re suggesting that maybe choosing not to have sex should nt consistently end the romance arc outright .
  - It would be realistic if that worked for some but not all romances .
- - Suh would be stoned for that shit lol
  - Suh does nt have the balls to hit a guy who is standing up . He only takes cheap shots on prone players .
- - Well now I am completely unable to scroll .
  - Your mouse has to be in the middle part . This will be fixed as soon as I can  sorry for the inconvenience .
  - What s a mouse  Is that like my finger

- - One of the pictures shows a Florida elementary school  which is not too far from Orlando .
  - Maybe email that school with this pic  Or return to sender might be safer ... School might find it odd to get an email asking about a kid 
  - I would go to the school  with the box  give it to the admin to deliver to the kid or the parents .
  - That s a good one too . Not knowing how far school is from OP that might be a lot to ask .
- - Super cute panties on a cute bum . Would love to see more  Nicole xx

  - I ca nt think of a single dive that serves such a fine selection of single malt scotch ... you sure you are nt thinking of somewhere else 
- - every girl does that . Just cuz it doesnt happen on porn ...
  - I know right  If they did nt we would nt be here .
- - Right now I m rocking the mutation x but I m looking for something a little less air flow and more towards the flavor side
  - The Marquis RDA is worth looking into as well . It s pricey but I ve heard pretty amazing things about it as far as flavor goes .
- - Yes indeed  but care only about yourself now . You must go on and enjoy better the life that you deserve .
  - Learning to enjoy my life now . It s hard but not impossible . Thank you for your support .

- - Have favors too . Is it wise to play both 
  - Yup  me too . I m hyped to own that frontcourt .
- - That s awfully judgemental of you considering you know no more about me than my username . You seem foolish but I ve kept that to myself .
  - How am I judging  I m asking you a question .
- - See how he is already dismissing free market  Drop the labels and unify under his leftwing statist position 
  - I m left wing I m with him then .
- - I clicked on the dick pic . Is that gay  Also  to apply the sharpie you laid that bitch out flat and then run my white shit around it 
  - Either that  or youre low-key attracted to me  which is still gay . I held it up and dragged my white stuff .
- - Understand  that the name is wrong  I am not dissing the loading card ...
  - yes its actually Master Guan Fu Guan Yu .
- - you will have to make the file executable as well i think
  - Sorry for being dumb  but I really have no clue how to do any of this . Is there a step by step anywhere you know of 
- - So ... can i tell people my cute little caique parrot is a ferocious dino 
  - Yes  and I find that it is far more entertaining to think of flocks of sparrows as tiny  ravenous velociraptors
- - So  if you interpret the Bible a certain way  it says one thing that is less violent . But Muslims are not allowed to do the same 
  - We re taking literal interpretation here . I provided the literal face value interpretations for both .

  - Repeat teams are not what we need .
- - Wait wtf  Which issue is this 
  - It s just a preview at the end of the issues . It does not denote was has happened . It could mean something totally different .
- - How on earth do I do this 
  - It s actually the easiest way to make a pizza and they are delicious .
- - Oh  well on that note  I m gon na need some chips and that fancy artichoke dip from that one restaurant and a bottle of cheap tequila and ...
  - I ve got everything but the dip . Generic potato chips and Tarantula 
- - Keep track of how many doors you walk through  but only count each door on the first time you walk through .
  - This would take so much discipline but I bet the results would be surprising 
- - That said  nothing is stopping you from running any of those services on a non-standard port .
  - Which is precisely why I find their policy so annoying .
- - pretentious would have been a better term .
  - Quite possibly  my only excuse is lack of sleep  really
- - So they run around with instruments and then when they are done with that  serve their country .
  - Not really  they mostly just run around with their instruments as their form of serving their country .
- - She was on tv here this morning . Pink and purple hair and she looks like she is an addict . Should be some sort of test for breeding .
  - The fact that the deranged father had custody and NOT the mother tells you something about her ...
- - Me too  I ve added your FC  i am online . I have seen you in my friends list
  - Sadly I was out all afternoon today . Left in such a rush  I forgot to update these posts . Will you be on tomorrow

  - I m set as of now and will keep checking throughout the day .
- - This guy is legit . Just purchased with paypal .
  - Yep  even I went first for this guy . Really good dude .
- - MSST still has an opportunity to stop them . I m all for an SEC team losing but acting like the entire game hinges on one call is asinine .
  - Yeah I agree but let s not act like calling something like it is is some sort of sin .
- - Well of course Gordon is in Gotham . Why  it s even the name of the show 
  - I did nt catch it even after this comment . I just reread what I said .

- - Ight Club  a club full of dudes that are doing neither good nor bad .
  - Fight Cub . The story of Simba and how he became one of the greatest kings of the jungle . aka The Lion King .
- - Pat and Eddie laughing at inside jokes . Never change  guys .
  - I hate not being able to watch their feed .
- - It s not the biggest hurdle to mass adoption . Lack of killer app is .
  - There are a million killer apps on the way  trust me .
- - I thought Dortmund s arch rival was Schalke
  - Dortmund with Schalke colours is in there as well as Dortmund with Bayern colours .
- - This is not only an inaccurate description of the situation . It is also a dangerous mind set to have . It divides people and cause fear .
  - Seriously . Some people seem to seek conflict in any situation  regardless of any fact or logic
- - Pls moderators do nt delete  I NEED answers
  - It s because he s Zlatan  everyone nose that
- - That thought always makes me wonder about those people so fat that they ca nt move from their bed .
  - They would probably get munched on and have very little to revive .

  - not in all cases . It may work for you  but it sure does nt work for me .
- - They are sweet when they re by themselves  but turn into dicks when they re in a group .
  - I ll admit this is me but only a use I m easily peer pressured into saying things
- - Yeah we need Dos Anjos  Assuncao and Rumble Johnson .
  - I d be happy with that being the last patch .
  - Personally I would really like Alvarez as well as Barnett
  - Oh yeah me too  I just meant that if they were nt releasing anymore patches I would be fine with it .
- - I do try and approach things in a balanced manner  it did nt sound right hence the gentle question to those who understand more than I .
  - I m sure  but the only places that talk about taqiyya are anti Islam sites  because it really does nt exist in Islam .
- - That s beautiful  Oh man  hair envy over here .
  - Thank you so much  I m so lucky I got the stylist I did  she did such an amazing job .
- - Same here . I actually do nt understand how you die in this game . Even if you get low  its easy to retreat .
  - It was actually kind of sad - I had to die by choice to see the mechanic .
- - TT can dunk . TT can not shoot . TT needs to dunk everything he gets .
  - He needs to start watching every ben wallace game .
- - Dpj and Planet Destiny upload daily content .
  - Checked out Planet Destiny  good call .
- - It s good to slow down and collect your thoughts  but do nt do it too much or you re a hoarder .
  - Have you seen Facebook  Yes to hoarding .
- - GG Cavs hope you guys find ways to get some wins without Lebron in this stretch .
  - Honestly  it should nt be this hard . Kyrie and Love both should be able to shoulder the load . Mozgov ca nt come quickly enough
- - All that and you did nt even mention Failure to Launch .
  - It was nt a commercial failure . It far more than doubled its budget .
- - I do nt see any links on it to sources  so I m skeptical .
  - That s what I thought when i saw it  but i ll cross my fingers .
- - Yeah tony looked off today . All of the different looks that he got were throwing him off . He did nt know weather to step up or leave the pocket .
  - Not sure if I should like you because of your flair or hate you because of your username ...
- - It was you that asserted there was evidence for the flood  the least you could do would be to back it up .
  - Did you read the link  It s in there .
- - I got a poorly written email saying they were processing my order will get it later
  - They did nt even bother replying to mine . Im thinking about canceling .
- - For transportation would nt you want a cruiser  Sorry if I sound like an ass I m just curious .
  - lol yeah that would ve been better but this will still work
- - I dont get it . Very ambiguous . How long do you get to play on the screen 
  - I m not certain on the time limits for the big screen  but you a free to roam about and play on your own machine for the entire day .
- - No it s not . That s what you are saying . The church would use its money for its business ventures seems like the null hypothesis to me .
  - Yup . I want to build this mall and my members gave me a few billion dollars in tithes ... What would you do 
- - Thank you for getting the reference and not making me look like a bigger creep than I am
  - Not a problem  Thought the joke was pretty funny and creative .
- - Why is this here  That s a Navy jet ...
  - It s apart of the Iranian Air Force ...
- - Men have a whole store just for plus sized  or tall .
  - I should nt have assumed that Canada and America had the same types of stores . My mistake .
- - This is really an unprecedented tank though .
  - It is nt . Teams have tanked for multiple seasons before .

  - No  I have nt used any new products recently .
- - the guitar and drums are ok  but god damn he needs to work on his vocals
  - He s dead  so that wo nt happen .
- - Statistically yes . Why dont you fuck off .
  - dont talk to reese like that he my nigga

- - WE RE SO NOT GON NA CHOKE IN THE OFFSEASON DAMN IT
  - I DO NT THINK THE ANGELS WILL CHOKE IN THE OFFSEASON EITHER

  - How would they be using the box as bait  Do you speed up for the speed camera 
- - You are replying to the wrong person .
  - I m replying to the person who replied to me .
- - Half an hour too long and too much exposition . Once the overture started  it was amazing .
  - Agreed the overture was incredible and there was a few moments and explanations that could have been left out .
- - No you didnt . This le gem was posted here several weeks ago .
  - Maybe one of them was trolling and posted an already seen status on their friends account .
- - keep saying that yourself . Maybe that s how you feel better . Now  FO
  - hey dude  its called joke  look it up .
- - Nothing between March and September  LOL  game over man .

  - Hahahaha . You should see it through a rift  Aliasing indeed .
- - how does the manga compare to the anime  I love the anime so i was wondering .
  - I would say the anime is no where as good as the manga . I m not saying the anime is bad  just that the manga is that great .
- - Trolling  Nah  people here just lack the intellectual capacity to comprehend dissenting opinions . If valid opinions cause anger that s something they ought to work on .
  - Maybe it s not the opinion but the way you put it . No need to bring Autism into a discussion  and no need to constantly put downers on everything .
- - Such thinking is just as bad as extremism . People like you are why we even had a Dark Age .
  - I understand your knee-jerk reaction but I am merely asking to see if someone can even think of a way that it could reasonably be done .
- - What episode is that second scene from with Aang  Probably not important ...
  - I think it s from The Great Divide
- - paying for a service literally entitles you to it
  - Should nt entitle you to act like a child when things do nt go your way .

  - Are you under the impression that we disagree 
  - I m poking you with stick to see what kind of candy comes out .
  - I d reach through the internet and slap you if I could . D
- - TIL I eat sugar free candy on a daily basis .
  - Yet you are somehow still among the living ...
- - Here s hoping Robert Duvall reads this  and then has a kid  and then names the kid this . Duvet Duvall  do you see 
  - Yes . We need to make this happen .
- - If this works out for you  I ll be amazed .
  - Wanted . A Genie in a Lamp to grant me this wish as finding a Genie in lamp has more chances of happening than this .
- - Center Field has enough emotion to choke me up when it comes on the radio ... John Fogerty FTW  Full disclosure . Bull Durham also gets me all emotional .
  - John fogerty  Gets you choked up 
- - Well the colours can fade due to the sunlight  and it will also make icy soles yellow faster .
  - What if the shoes were nt in direct sunlight  Would that be fine 
- - No need for hostility . If you think we re all mentally defective  why are you here 
  - To get a response from the devs  Jesus  it s like my insult is true -- how could I even doubt it 
- - get it if you dont have it but be sure to do your weekly heroic every week if you got three characters thats better .

- - I d love to see this Australian team tour India now . Especially looking forward to see the performances of Warner and Smith
  - They d probably do better than last time but still lose . Though Lyon has a dedicated spot this time so possible he d be the leading Aussie wicket taker
- - The problem is that fear mongering is easily simplified  but our side is nt . Shortest argument has a massive advantage .
  - The short answer response to push would be to look who funds the attack .
- - i have not seen her everything so i could not say that .
  - Let s be honest  it s safe to assume she has nice everything .
- - Just the first season of Sherlock  
  - The second one was okay  though nothing compared to the first  but the third season deteriorated into ridiculousness .
- - Conan Obrien is now Tywin Lannister from Game of Thrones .
  - Would nt even skip a beat . Give me Andy as Varys too
- - Why dont more db s just intentionally get there legs tangled with the receiver 
  - That d probably be really hard to do .
- - Still a teenager  but every now and again I say something jokingly that makes people look at me weird or makes the situation awkward .
  - wow nice umbrella situation for every single person ever .
- - I m pretty sure you just said the same thing he did . But added buzz words like herd immunity to make yourself seem smart
  - It s not a buzz word to my knowledge . It s an actual scientific term that relates here  but alright .
- - Why ca nt I stop listening to this tape  Owl Pharoah  what do you guys think  Is it worth 
  - Hell yeah owl pharaoh s dope as well
- - Dude  what kind of bread and cheese is that  Looks delish  
  - do nt know about that bread  but that cheese looks like havarti .
- - It s not like these were random stops . The cops scanned him and saw the wanted status . Overzealous perhaps  but not unwarranted .
  - Then why do they scan you when you drop out of supercruise  I would assume  since they do that  they are nt scanning you before interdicting you .
- - He went out the next game against the Mavs .
  - Thanks for clearing that up . Is he supposed to be back this coming week

- - What s the problem with KDE  RPM and systemd  If you do nt like them  ok  but do nt project your opinions too much on others .

- - I just pointed that out to my wife a couple nights ago as it took me by surprise . But ... I like friends too .
  - Yeah same . It s the only sitcom I can really get through
- - I have no direct experience with this  but I ve read here that a microwave can help remove some moisture from the KL .
  - Was going to say this . The microwave with evap some of the moisture and should help .
- - Ahh damn  I thought we made it out of Artifical Mass Blocks . My bad 
  - That explains it  considering how often you d have to tell people in chat why you could nt use a gravity generator with the sarlacc pit .
- - Aww . I kind of like how Jordan looks with his hair . Kind of like a mountain man . Sad it has to go now .
  - hopefully this will become an annual thing for him so we can see him lose his sanity every Christmas .
- - It looks so pretty i just wonder  do nt loops get stuck behind things a lot 
  - I wore it out today without much trouble  but I was nt doing much really  just walking .
- - This is like all the new years Horoscopes out of a newspaper combined into one  lol .
  - do you people believe in those things  empty science
- - There are very few reasons to ever hit a child but there are plenty of fucking reasons to hit a teenager .
  - There are still very few reasons to hit a teenager . This is one of the reasons .
- - You seem just the person who would claim to be allergic to tap water .
  - I m allergic to like half the planet . It sucks . No one believes me until they ve seen me come out of a shower covered in hives .
- - I ll check that out . I think I m ok with a very minimal wallet . I m really interested in the phone wallet combo .
  - It s a leather wallet that sticks to the back of your iPhone .
- - I actually have no choice in the matter of having a Mac and not a Windows . Too poor to buy a gaming laptop .
  - Unless you got your mac on the extremely cheap or free  you did have a choice and you botched it significantly
- - But I assume you did nt get a giftable copy either  Still  you d be silly to buy the DLC individually .
  - You are correct  they specify during checkout that you will not receive a giftable copy of Skyrim . Somewhat annoying  but I saved money on the DLC anyway .
- - I believe the routine blood tests done in pregnancy may sometimes include drug tests
  - Ive never been drug tested  and I m on medicaid
- - Thats crazy . Countless US citizens receive free medical treatment ... no questions asked . US needs to reciprocate somehow . Being trapped in the country is madness .
  - No they dont . Yanks get a bill from the NHS .
- - Why do you think showing offensive content to high school students would be appropriate  It has literally nothing to do with political science .
  - It baffles me how frail Americans think their High school students are .
- - I went to school in Wisconsin . These cheese curds suck .
  - I ll take your word for it ... I ve never been to Wisconsin 
- - OK  sure  but you re still running this in a stored procedure  thus polluting your database with application logic .
  - you appear to have very little understanding of what you re talking about .
- - could nt you just use TinEye to reverse lookup each of your instagram pictures and see if they re used anywhere else 
  - I do nt think TinEye is capable of searching Instagram or Facebook for duplicate photos .
- - Going into a bathroom while someone is showering in there . There s a point for the curtain being there  right 
  - I think the curtain is there so water does nt splash everywhere .
- - FB rep says raid is coming this month ... Legit 
  - or maybe he has since been fired for his lies 
- - I always wonder if Hitler will be vilified a few generations from now ... Genghis Kahn killed way more people and he s remembered positively .
  - Cmon man ... hitler should always be vilified . Was he a skilled leader and orator  Yes . But also a horrible person . That should never be forgotten
- - That is quite the shitty situation . Thanks for the detailed answer dude .
  - For sure  It s a shame as New York really does have some great soccer fans  and nobody deserves to be treated like this .
- - Aww wtf . The white young pyromancer is better than the red one  Jesus  just Nerf white already
  - One mana is a whole goddamned lot  man .
- - So ... how much did the Cowboys pay the refs 
  - Have nt been watching much of the game have you
- - I mean this particular link  which is very old .
  - I m seriously not clear how you think this link has never been posted .
- - Wolverine and Spider-Man do nt belong in the Avengers  even in cat form .
  - I am in the minority that agrees with you . Marvel debased Wolverine  Spider-Man  and the Avengers with that roster .
- - So they redid the movie huh  Haha
  - Yes Michael Bay is behind the remake ...
- - This is the creepiest octopus I ve ever seen in my life ... That face will hunt me ...
  - Awwwww  noooo  He s so pretty 
- - Bringing some real substance to the conversation  I see .
  - I m sorry  I ca nt help myself ... It was ME  Barry  I WAS THE SIGH 
- - North Korea ... Mind hacking a couple emails 
  - I do nt think we need north korea ...
- - Do you not fill the top one  Would nt it filter twice then 
  - If you do that then you suck water up from it like a straw . Physics lol .
- - I love locos . LOCOS  ZOMG  . D
  - I wish we had train sets based on Indian Railway designs like they do in America and UK .
- - It s really sad that normal people have trouble finding clothes that are nt mammoth sized
  - Because we are becoming less normal  we normal will soon become elite . And the elite considered super human hahaha
- - LOL Golden Tate burned Barry Church for a TD lmao
  - After getting popped on that punt return .
- - Love the bar work dude  The FJ is a great looking car when it s worked on  big blind spots though right 
  - Yeah . They are pretty bad . Did nt realize how bad until I drove a friends BMW the other day 
- - Yea the Toews call was bullshit . The lack of call earlier was to .
  - That s what s important to remember  the calls went both ways .
  - Yeah but bad calls earlier did nt end the game
  - Well you guys could ve scored on them  but you were nt able to .
- - Did the film say that  I thought that as long as anything got in the gap it could harm Smaug . Which was why Bard was trying with normal arrows .
  - Erm what  Bard only noticed the gap when he lined up the last black arrow  before that he was just randomly shooting arrows at him .
- - So that s what happened to Farva 
  - All he wanted was his liter of cola
- - would it cost more than a cab 
  - Not if the ride is within busted leg walking distance .
- - They are not liberal . And therefore  they are evil .
  - I do nt care what party they belong to ... I do nt vote for morons .
- - Didnt think you d get that less of joints
  - There s a LOT still ground up  need to run and buy more cones
- - Alrighty then ... then let s keep eachother company until one of us falls asleep .
  - What did you do for new years today 
- - I kinda figured . But still  that s like getting rid of hookers from GTA .
  - Whaaaaaaaaaaaat  They re getting rid of hookers in GTA 
  - No  it s just a simile .
  - Yeah . I just wanted to joke .
- - Why do we continue to get these memes  Do Americans consider all other countries forces as weak 
  - No  we consider obsessive patriotism funny because it s ridiculous . This is satirical .
- - Fuck that  I m not a tracker but that looks like its going to take some time .
  - Yep  a lot of time and a blowtorch are required for that type of fuckery
- - Either that s a rape threat or a death threat  and I m not sure which one is worse at this point .
  - Could be both . In either order . Who knows .
- - Have you tried medical marijuana  If not give a look into it .
  - I actually have  and it helped my emotional stuff but none of the physical .
- - I hope it kinda gets chippy . Washington Philadelphia games are always fun .
  - Please no fighting . I do nt want any injuries on either team  especially on the Caps .
- - Awesome job man  Almost nobody can do this  do nt let anyone make you feel like it is nt an achievement
  - kk i take your advice by heart  . D
- - Does Hilton usually drop that many passes 
  - This season his drops have been pretty much slim to none .
- - That gif is in slow motion  so it really does a horrible job showing the timing of the incident
  - It does a great job of showing how many steps he kept taking while holding onto his face though .
- - Elins desync a lot on rain of blows on warriors .
  - That is a dick move tho  but I can see how it is relevant .
- - This is stunning  Just curious - do you use a primer underneath your MAC Painterly  Or do you use it as your primer 
  - Thank you  I use Painterly as my primer  it works amazing to increase the pigment of eyeshadows and helps them last all day .
- - There is not a single imaginary friend that has done good .
  - Mine encourages me to be nice to puppies and old people .
- - Love those handlebars  are there a few similar to that  I wan na look into drops from my SS
  - They re Ritchey Logic Classic Curves . Not too pricey and very comfy .
- - Not a fan of Conte but he is right . If you are going to be realistic about anti doping you have to use CIR testing .
  - Victor Conte is probably THE MOST knowledgeable person in the world on PED use . Even more knowledgeable than Lance Armstrong .
- - You put up a warning in a tirade thread 
  - Well I was nt sure how it would be taken with the cussing . Haha  next time I wo nt 
- - I would accept coal as the future if they brought back steam trains  airships and shoe shine boys . My shoes are filthy .
  - They will need to with all the coal dust going around .
- - Hmm  Have donated weapons to the guards working there 
  - That seems ... yeah that can be a thing . Many factions guard the Galactic center  and some bigger ones donate weaponry .
- - No . No  I do nt .
  - do nt click the link ... looks bad but I ve seen worse
- - PINS is a Federal park  not a state park . You will need a license for PINS .
  - Well I guess that clears that up . Thanks 
- - Honestly  Scrapbots for raid repairing . Sure Highmaul has some outdoor areas  but scrapbots were awesome in SoO .
  - Yep  always useful to have scrapbots and Jeeves  the relatively low CD on scrapbots mean you will pretty much always be able to provide repairs if someone needs them .
- - How long does it run and how long does It cycle off for 
  - I m not dealing with a problem here  just looking for some knowledge .
- - So far  I suck at fists of Havoc . But punching stuff is cool 
  - I did at first too  but it comes with time
- - Was him running into the returner really deserving of a penalty  Maybe I did nt see it right but that seemed extremely weak . Honestly just curious
  - It is nt about him tapping the return guy  it s about him interfering with the returners ability to make a fair catch .
- - You re not alone . Save for a couple main quests  I pretty much avoid Vivec until my speed is leveled up or I have a strong levitation spell .
  - Just play with boots of blinding speed .
- - I wonder if he still has that plush sloth he got with his adoption certificate on his bed .
  - I bet his phone looks real nice in that new case that he got for Christmas .
  - He is not using a case Just checked
  - Well  he should be  it s sometimes considered rude when you get something like that in your stocking and do nt use it .
- - when you say mug ... on a motorcycle ... do you mean like a thermos 
  - I have one of those Contigo push to drink travel mugs .
- - entire west is also below the number needed for stable population .
  - Except for the United States  if you count immigration .
- - Congratulations  You ve won GRID and Worms Ultimate Mayhem . Deluxe Edition  PM should be received soon with Steam key inside .
  - Wow thank you  I am actually on Holiday vacation so will be activating these when I get back home .
- - Do nt the Browns own past Browns history 
  - They do but they still have nt been to one
- - That must mean religious people are literally dumb as rocks .
  - Not dumb  per se . Easily influenced perhaps .
- - Humans should not be the crumple zone .
  - The back tire will almost certainly come out unscathed
- - So if Fetishism is a mental condition that can get you banned from driving  would nt that pretty ban everyone  unless they are completely asexual .
  - Asexuals are also in the list of people who are banned from driving .
- - Did you have either Tetra Lockscreen or Live Lockscreen Beta installed  I think either of these could cause those problems .
  - Nope  I do nt have any of those lockscreens ...
- - Awesome . I really want to do this when I have my own house .
  - If you ever do it I d love to see 
- - Do you remember the name of the company that came out and fixed it  We handle lots of tires .
  - Love s came out and replaced the tire and rim . Took a while longer than I would have preferred but it is what it is .
- - well neither is the money actually provided right away
  - With Ukraine s history of corruption  that is a good thing . Make sure it arrives as needed and only used as intended .
- - Typically when a new OC is brought in  does that mean there will probably be large turnover in the offensive position coaches as well 
  - Typically yes  but not always . Lovie is very very loyal  to a fault .
- - With the cost of transporting things to space  why are nt they just sending movies through the radio 
  - The most expensive copy of the film and television show ever .
- - is nt there a thing in the options to change keybinds 
  - i hope there is  but i ca nt find it .
- - Yes  let s continue to devalue the college degree . Might as well just hand them out for free .
  - So college is about the prestige  not the education 
- - Is the part where he rapes a minor in the docu 
  - I m gon na watch that part in slow motion .
- - Indeed . You should have asked him to mail it you . He already knows about and hey you probably want it .
  - it was less of a hassle to just pack it up better when i visited . it was never discussed again .
- - In fact sometimes at work I ll just sip from an empty cup .
  - Ca nt tell if you re being serious ...
- - For me  I have it hit against walls and other stuff  no scratches .
  - Awesome  that s a load off my mind - thanks 
- - This is what I love about them ... on the first hand  they deny the holocaust  and on the second hand  they wished Hitler killed more Jews .
  - I think these idiots just do whatever possible to spite Israel and Jews .
- - Unless we re in a competition of who can run over someone better than the other guy . Because we could both do that easily .
  - Criminals usually do nt care much about killing power . It s about getting away with the crime .
- - Having the cupboard doors off looks awful .
  - Is that necessary  I think it s really cute .
- - Dude welcome to life . No money  no item you want . Keep voting democrat and begging on forums ... maybe you ll get lucky
  - Yeah thats right . Just asking for your charity . P Gl with your trade
- - I d say that is far more insane  my friend . . P
  - I m in it for the long run haha  Third year in a row I ve watched the live stream  such a great way to bring in the new year
- - Is nt this game heavily reliant on the DLCs 
  - No  the DLCs are mostly cosmetic skins . There are some weapon DLCs but you can enjoy the game without them .
- - I was so pumped I threw in an extra CC and injected blindfolded .
  - More CC is always the solution . But blindfolded  I might accidentally pin the wrong muscle .
- - Cassandra if Leliana has nt been softened . Leliana if she s been softened .
  - How do I know if she has been softened 
- - The are usually more men in management positions for sure . Pretty strange considering social works focus on social justice and equality ...
  - Yea its great for men but as male social workers we should be aware of that come promotion time
- - That ST is so vibrant that even in a low light setting  it s still glowing .
  - I am quite happy with the color choice .
- - I do nt mind losing to the Hawks . They re fucking good and they are nt dirty players . Big respect .
  - Respect for the best underrated teams in the nba .
- - Thank you  I would be thrilled if you did have a tutorial on this . I feel like I m pretty well organized but maybe not for this .
  - are you a windows or mac user 
- - I hope that Platinum will make a Kid Icarus sequel . They could do some amazing stuff with the franchise .
  - Bayonetta style KI  That vaporized my wallet . Especially if they get the rights to habe some higher quality merch .
  - Platinum can do more then make Bayonetta games FYI .
  - Im just saying the combat style would be cool with KI .
- - We really must stop running into each other like this  Wait no  strike that  reverse it .
  - Haha  it ll keep happening  trust me
- - Most published writers have day jobs . Ms. Jay should find one as well .
  - I think what would be preferred is for writer s needing day jobs to be for the minority rather than the majority .
- - I m sorry  what s a BB 
  - Beta bucks . A man who works for his family and the wife is not remotely excited by him .
- - I have always disliked this guy . I wish he would face some repercussions but he wo nt so that is good .
  - Do nt talk about Rico like that 
- - Norway so rich I ca nt even see their GDP
  - No  it s just so much oil overflowing that it covered whole Norway .
- - I hope for everyone s sake that no one has had to experience visuals like that . That shit is straight up frightening .
  - Those are pretty how much I believe people look when you take Bromo Dragonfly overdose .
- - Did the Ducks just play Manchester Orchestra during the stop in play 
  - Yup . I really love the music we play .
- - Worst thread to hope for links in ever .
  - considering a good amount is child porn .
- - have you fixed it yet or is it still down . im getting the same error message saying something about my firewall
  - nope . It looks like a global issue . I sent a ticket to riot support and will update as soon as they answer me .
- - Do nt want to be Mr. Douche  but they were actually based on vintage roller skates  That s why they release a roller skate model .
  - I m not talking about the court classics in general . I m talking about these specific ones with with the perforated toe box
- - dude you should have posted these individually for max karma
  - I do nt want to flood the sub with my pic so I prefer to pack it up instead
- - The SMG is a little over power but really only when zoomed in
  - And thats the only way I use it .
- - Chinese son ca nt become American by having American mom 
  - Yes  but presumably his bio dad and that entire side of his family is still in China  and he d like to see them not infrequently
- - I keep seeing shitty aces with similar titles here but this one was actually good .
  - Do you not know who scream is 
- - the concept was strong  the execution was armature .
  - I thought the execution was exactly like the Doritos amateur commercials - so it was pretty spot on .
- - Damn  that laugh was pretty contagious . I do nt think I ve ever see someone drop a pistol to pick up a primary . Pretty hilarious .
  - My cheeks are hurting after watching those two vids and smiling so much .
- - Lets not forget the NSAC banned Nick Diaz for a year in his prime for a bit of weed ...
  - Nick got popped in his post fight drug test  Jones got popped in his pre fight drug test .
- - Yes  but real job openings are scarce . Plenty of apartments but few can afford them .
  - What are your qualifications  For the IT sector there s a lot of churn in entry level positions ...
- - That guy deserves more viewers  fucking brilliant .
  - Unfortunately he stopped making these a while back . I d love to see this series on Adult Swim or something similar .
- - When was Adam commanded to protect Eve 
  - Yeah I do nt remember this part at all .
