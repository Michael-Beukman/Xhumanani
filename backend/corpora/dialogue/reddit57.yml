- - Lucky . I go to a heathen school with ipads imacs and macbooks and I am the only one there who is not an apple fangirl
  - I do nt understand why schools would pay for all that when you could buy cheap PCs
- - My guess is that they take one name from x  then go through x s match history and add everyone they ve played with recently and it spreads

  - I d prefer they get rid of hate speech laws altogether . But  if they re going to have them  may as well be equitable .
- - Use an SRB as a missile to take out the engine
  - I suppose I could use a weapons mod for that too .
- - Really seems like it s going to turn into an anti public trackers circlejerk ...
  - It s only a circlejerk if you do nt stick to the facts  and the facts are all we have to stick to in order to dispel popular myths .
- - I m female and a photographer  so I could probably rack up quite a bit of karma if I were willing to get naked .

- - If you want freedom for Palestine  this is awful news .
  - Very few people who want freedom for Palestine have any love for Hamas . Hamas is half the problem .

  - Walking through a mall can do that too IMO
- - I just do nt want to ever read another horrible fucking UG blog again .
  - But then you ll miss what somebody said on Twitter about something 
- - Usher or maybe you can convince your man to let him be a Junior Groomsman so you can still exclude him from the main photos .

- - Tea . Who gives a fuck it s leaves and water .
  - Until you add milk and sugar and dip biscuits into it . Good god I m salivating at the thought . It s a national comfort food .

  - Also from Kingston and would definitely stop by when I m in toronto
- - nice  but it looks like he stepped out of the penalty box
  - That does nt matter  does it  Surely it s the ball s position that matters 
  - of course the balls position is crucial  but it seems to me that he releases it even further ahead ...
  - You may well be right . edit . I did find another view on youtube that shows he did nt handle the ball outside of the box
- - I forgot you can use simple syrup for a whiskey sour . That is very good to know
  - You can use simple with any cocktail that has a citrus element in order to provide balance ...

  - Oh  you and me both Longhorn bro . You and me both .
- - Hi SoundboardFez . Thanks for bringing breakfast .

- - You have no idea what you re talking about .
  - Well  thanks for clearing nothing up .
- - She ca nt be forced to get help until and unless she is a danger to herself or others .
  - I know . That s why it hurts so much . It s like all I can do is watch her get worse and worse
- - never build the first CC on the high ground dude . man up . P
  - Thing is  I hardly ever see enough lings to stop it anyway . Like I said  playing scared . New Year s resolution . build on the low ground 
- - The continued laughing from the dramatization to actual Dennis is amazing . I do nt get how they write such tiny details like that  that manage to be so hilarious .
  - It really was . And the shot with all of them just looking at him when he s laughing  genius 
- - How bout this  as soon as I get approved I ll do it for you .
  - That would be pretty cool . I m not sure why its even private when everyone gets approved . lol
- - Alright I ll load an array of links when the program starts .
  - Could it quote the most negatively rated post from whatever sub it s posting in  So it can spread drama and butts in sweet synchronicity . D
- - The Italian republic denounces the Greek government . Our retaliation will continue as planned  Corfu will be free from your nation once and for all .

- - You are loved . I wish you many good days ahead .
  - Thank you  and to you as well . Be safe in the sandbox .

  - We have nt talked . Safe to say we probably wo nt either  I do nt really want to
- - I know a girl who used a carrot  felt bad  then ate it .
  - Quite a talent to be able to toss your salad .
- - As always the default subs comment section is full of children and idiots adding nothing to the discussion . I do nt even know why I bother looking sometimes .
  - And what are you adding to the discussion with this comment 
- - Just out of curiosity  why did you go with a supercharger instead of a different motor . Is nt the cost about the same 
  - Is it really the same price  I thought that a supercharger would be cheaper and alot less labor to install .
- - You re tellin me ... I had four and a half shitty hours of powerpoint presentations to grade today . Goddamn  this is great . Thank you .
  - And i had a PowerPoint due today ...
- - SMG shot  Karma  Scump  Aches  Mirx AR shot  Swanny
  - Just Swanny  I forgot about him to but I agree he is just Deadly lethal with one .
- - Records should be stored vertically . Stacking records can cause them to warp .
  - I still do nt get how stacked records can warp . They are flat against flat  any warping would be minimal .
- - In a rush to sell  I get paid on a week
  - No rush  but first come  first serve .
- - Josh where did you go  Why are nt you answering us  Too afraid to speak in a forum that you ca nt censor 
  - you dont read do you  there compiling questions .
- - This thread makes me think you need to reread Hegemon .
  - Well exactly . It happened in shadow of the hegemon . Not in shadow puppets .
- - Want to sell me one of those three you have 
  - Down to two now ... PM me and we can discuss it
- - So could I buy this  not redeem it for a while  and still get it on steam  Or will the codes stop working relatively soon 
  - According to OP codes will always work even years later .
- - I can do this on my phone . How are people so retarded 
  - I actually did crop this on my phone . The same one OP has .
- - wow pretty nice ... who did this 
  - Pretty sure it was the ad agency that handles Valencia branding .
- - Lift weights get dates . Do curls get girls . You ca nt change your face  but there is something you can do .
  - Fixed my teeth  that went pretty well . I tend to enjoy them whilst I sit at home and brood about how much I hate going out now .
- - Yup  they re all upset that I said that the south is nt all bigoted . They re proving me correct . Thanks sweetie .
  - You clearly object to a certain group being stereotyped  and then proceed to stereotype another . Well done .
- - It s honestly one or the other . After those there is nt much left in the way of star power . It was a pretty crappy draft year
  - It s remarkable how much better the first round has been since the lockout .
- - Added . Could you still please add me . It s my birthday today  the Pokemon center celebrated it and everything . D lol would love an Eevee .
  - Happy birthday  I ve added you .

  - Finally switched from Sprint to T-Mo last month . I was shocked how bad Sprint was around here .
- - Maybe It s sold out and that is the reason why they remove the tweet .
  - lol sold out from not even being sold yet . that is mind blowing . P
  - They want you to believe that they have them  but they are trolling us for the lols .
  - yeah and if they do open it they should send a MARIO amiibo
- - I m sorry this is a nightmare   the norm is that people usually find a way to evade paying taxes
  - And oddly enough  I m trying to do the opposite .
- - And if your hair looks like that  never trust your hair stylist .
  - The kingdom hearts games gave me very unrealistic expectations of what my hair would look like when I grew it out .
- - Should the anger be directed towards Nintendo for creating false inventory shortages to skyrocket demand 
  - Why in the world would they create false shortages  There is only LESS money in it for them if they produce small numbers .
- - yes but how do I win one of these elusive movies   I ca nt sleep and need something to watch 
  - You just chat . You might get picked  you might not . It all depends .
- - Speak for yourself . My New Year s resolution is to eat more cookies 
  - I think this is one you might be able to keep .
- - It s pleasing to know that most of the people in that thread have much less money now than they had last year .
  - You re measuring in dirty fiat . Maybe they have more bitcoins  which should obviously be everyone s goal .
- - I was undecided on the issue of how UKIP can be a major party but not the Greens until I looked at the graphs in this link .
  - Being the first political party other than Labour or Conservative to win any nationally conducted election in the UK in over a hundred years did it for me .
- - Vision of Confluence and the Saterienne Rapier from the Crucible Quartermaster are really good .
  - VoC tops the charts for me too .
- - Could nt find an answer to this in the thread  but those shelves are gorgeous  and where did you get them 
  - Wal-Mart  I have the same exact ones . I was looking at that same coffee table too .
- - This does nt cause any trouble with WoW s anti-cheat stuff  I always thought third-party programs were against the terms of service . Sounds neat though .
  - no not at all  all addons are allowed  if you go on the site i linked you you can use anything you want
- - It pretty much is by this subs standards ...
  - I think you have to play it by ear  depends HOW suggestive as far as im concerned
- - okay I do nt want to pressure you into sending pics if you re uncomfortable but I d like to see that for myself if that s okay
  - You re gon na be disappoint  but I shall PM them 
- - He said you got ta shout out snackbar while you chop off the head
  - I pulled out my kalashnikov  bored  and sprayed
- - Not being an accountant . This is a dream I realized I had when I became an accountant .
  - You could always quit your job . But high five  fellow accountant 
- - why are you even here  get the fuck out
  - Sorry I disturbed the hive mind by misunderstanding a joke . I should have known better than to disagree with someone on the internet .
- - What is that based off just wondering . Also if that s true that s really offensive to the player base . There is no reason they ca nt have both .
  - He does nt want a casual player to come in and get trashed by a competitive player and get turned off from the game
- - You have just the amount of unique touch to the basics that I ca nt help but look forward of your future sketches  Great work .
  - Thanks . I ve realized recently that my work looks better if I do it as fast as possible . Understanding my weaknesses have really helped me quite a bit .
- - your music is still better in my estimation .
  - As a general rule  they tend to have better bands  we tend to have better solo artists .
- - Ripping DVDs is a piece of cake though .
  - What s a good piece of software for doing so  on Windows 
- - Faerie fire to get stacks of the thing  Wtf are you talking about 
  - Use it to tag people who are just about to die to get the damage buff was what I meant  I forgot its name .
- - If you liked Evil Within  you should try Alien . Isolation
  - Oh yeah  Alien was fantastic too for sure  they talked on the episode a bunch tho so did nt mentioned it .
- - Nope  same shit weather as the rest of the country .
  - But I was told there were palm trees ...
- - I can get on  probably they letting people in batch by batch 
  - That s what the usually do  I think . I was already on for a bit before this was posted .
- - Pretty sure your neighbors know you did nt have a party .
  - The lack of people  music  booze ect would give it away
- - He won the Grand Prix  but I do nt think he ever actually had a belt in Strikeforce .
  - I thought the winner of the grand prix was considered the HW champ though .
  - He s a Grand Prix champ but does nt win the belt IIRC . I think that stayed with Overeem .
  - When he fought Frank Mir they announced him as the Strikeforce Heavyweight Champion .
- - There are a few more as well  but that s mostly it .
  - And then Canada . And then Australia . Never ending bullshit is being exposed every single time .
- - To my knowledge this is a liability . Someone could theoretically sue after eating spoiled garbage pizza .
  - But not if they put bleach on it and he eats it  That does nt make a whole lot of sense .
- - I just feel bad for them because they re stupid .
  - I almost ca nt feel bad . Ignorance is very unattractive .
- - It really was nt  and are you sure you re not thinking of the first incarnation of the Snickers duo 
  - That may well have been it  actually . I remember them doing it with a number of bars  and for some reason the Bounty stuck in my head .
- - There needs to be a sub for pictures of animals that have human-like faces
  - His name is Steve ... just kidding  meet Tango
- - Take a potato chip ... and eat it 
  - What s your name  So i can write it in my special notebook ...
- - This seems to make everthing sound echo unless I disable Surround Sound on the mix amp . Thanks for trying to help though .
  - I believe that is part of the surround sound emulation . I use my astros on lots of platforms . There is a slight echo effect that comes through .
- - Is that supposed to be satire or something  I thought satire was supposed to be ... you know ... fictional 
  - Oh  I know that . My bad with it being poorly asked .
- - That is impressive . OP  are you single 
  - If he is I ll marry him  holy crap . I do nt care he s a dude .
- - Is it just me or is this kid always getting injured 
  - He s been more banged up and cautious than truly injured .
- - Is there a way to get a copy of this 
  - What do you mean by a copy  It is in the public domain .
- - The Sugar is Toxic video argues its toxic but dose dependent because it causes metabolic disease and is only metabolized in the liver .
  - Everything is toxic once you stipulate that it s dose dependent .
- - honestly dont know how you arent always in LP  people usually hate techies players and report soon as you pick it . Dang .
  - because those reports are worthless because they ar nt based on a real problem
- - I did not know this  I ll keep it in mind for future reference .
  - Keep in mind that ubinited are also an all female team
- - How am i supposed to sleep with this football boner  
  - Hey  best way to prepare for sleep is to pitch a tent first

  - Well  you are playing sniper  people will assume you do nt know what you are doing .
- - Need mo  mass fo  them programs
  - Do nt even get me started on dark matter .

  - Man  he did nt know what planet he was on .
- - You had the hell dream  did nt you 
  - No . I mean  how could I dream when I was awake with paralyzing fear about hell and suffering 
- - It keeps cutting into CBS Sports Network pre-game shows during the game ... I missed the Indy TD . Is anyone else having this problem 
  - Yes . Fortunately I keep hearing about how well Doug Marrone s interview went .
- - Weird i never got the email . I ll make sure it s updated before the race
  - I also sent a quali lap yesterday before deadline . Not that it matters we ve already raced . Both of us ...
- - Bobrovsky had a hell of a month  but part of me wished Holtby would get a nod . He s been playing dynamite for us all month .
  - If he can keep it up I would nt be surprised if he gets it next month . He s been lights-out .
- - I m going to try this as the milk in my morning latte 
  - The best part of waking up is ABV in your cup 
- - Guys who have come off of injury should now have more accurate projections .
  - Looking good from a quick overview . Will dig deeper next week when I ve got flexibility to shift my roster again .
- - Is it ok if that i hated that autotune  Wish he sung it raw and hit all the off notes
  - Yes . It kills the song . I bet non autotuned covers will be way easier to listen to .
- - But then again the phone is barely worth that much these days so it might not even be worth it
  - Agreed  if I were OP I would just upgrade . But they seem to be pretty attached to the phone and want to make an effort to preserve it ...
- - if you look back in the history hes sold engrams back to back even after the dlc release
  - It seems he sells heavy ammo synth on weeks he doesnt do engrams
- - I do nt want to spend hours playing on my iPhone . Just a few minutes to reset timers during my work break or before sleep or something .
  - Fair enough . Hope you got some good suggestions  then .
- - Did we even get the server ip 
  - I will put that up later in the week
- - yeah south park now is really tame compared to some of the older ones lol  i wish they would get back to their roots
  - Their roots were pretty tame compared to later seasons . Some of the jokes were offensive but then they started being offensive just to be offensive which got old fast .
- - Sumo San is close to being as good . Space is nt as nice as Haiku though .
  - I just heard  too  that a car crashed into it on Sunday night 
- - I swear to god if this isnt a repost
  - Either finish that sentence or clean it up a little .
- - I feel like its not even a debate . Luck definitely has the potential to be great but he is not there yet .
  - Exactly . I really like Luck . He s a great player with huge potential . But this is seriously overlooking Romo s achievements .
- - I would like to drop them off in your town . LMK when you open
  - If you have an RMM I ll gladly rate it  and I d be happy if you were to rate mine in the original post as well  Thanks again 
- - Could you send me a link too please  I m always interested in tips and tricks .
  - For sure . I ll post it here .
- - My night never had an end ... just did nt sleep and now I am just dealing with it till I pass out
  - Rest in pepperonis  my friend . Maybe I too can turnip this evening .
- - Sill  Adams and Scuderi proves anyone can PK for a variety of different reasons
  - I think that s the wrong takeaway from that because Geno will never PK ever .
- - This makes me think of Keaton Henson .
  - Miss you terribly already  miss the space between your eyelids
