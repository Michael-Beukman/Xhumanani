  - Uhh how is that the same ... at all

  - All geopolitical events boil down to realpolitik . There are no insane despots  only competing interests .

  - Sure does  It looks pretty awesome in person . Very subtle until you re up close .

- - Very hot  Have you ever considered letting someone watch  Maybe another couple 
  - We are both kinda new to this but are definitely open to suggestions
- - Me too . Testicles . Still works .

- - The last picture where he s kissing you  THATS A HORSE  So adorable I love the picture where both of them are shit grinning to the camera . D
  - He s definitely a big dog now  He still looks like a puppy to me . The other Shepherd is his best buddy . They re ridiculously cute together .

- - How about a vampire  dog  chick love triangle movie 
  - Now that s something I can believe  why ca nt more movies have such believable plots 
- - Hopefully we can salvage him as a really pricy reliever . I do nt think he is reliable enough to count him in as a starter .
  - If you have a dodgy shoulder I dont think sporadic work of random lengths is the cure . If he s healthy  he needs to start .
- - If by fully resetting you mean switching it off and on again then yes . It takes a few minutes to reboot and re-establish the connection .
  - I think he means pressing the reset to factory settings button .
- - Just out of curiosity what are you working on 
  - At the time I was working an an inertial navigation system for a robot .

- - I liked her better on Supernatural . She got to wear cool clothes  speak with a Posh accent  and annoy the Winchesters .
  - Ooh my god that was her   You just changed how I feel watching Supernatural and The Walking Dead .
- - Yeah ... no . His only quantifiable light speed feat in combat is IT
  - No  he has heaps  go look at the respect thread . Saying he is nt MFTL is crazy  and unsubstantiated .
  - Dodging things that are nt stated to travel at light speed . Solid proof of FTL
  - Dodging things that are literally light ... Sounds pretty FTL to me mate .
- - If that duck does pushups for every point  he must be jacked underneath that costume . Pecs like a Schwarzenegger
  - There s like eight Ducks . Each time one dies of heat exhaustion we just roll out another one .
- - So lesser of two evils  Why not just not commit suicide and bear the cross you have been given

  - Our you sure that s what he our 
- - Most early games are on Saturdays and Sundays .
  - Especially Sundays because ABC will often play two afternoon games .

  - Well they wo nt even exist in this new storyline maybe
- - I do nt see where you re getting it  that is nt even his comment  that s yours .
  - Second part is his comment in reply to mine .
- - I do nt know . i was defending Taylor . Not even criticizing . This sub is weird sometimes .
  - Well according to some dude I was arguing with  it s wrong to defend Taylor in a Taylor sub .
- - Make posts with content  Do nt spam  Woo

  - To be fair the hawks are the top of the east . It is nt like we are losing to philly
- - Must be nice being able to logic away the murder of innocent people so easily
  - And where did I do that Mr. Strawman 
- - You want a spoiled child . Because this is how you get a spoiled child .

- - Awesome  thank you  Did you need anything else powersaved 
  - I ll let you know . Please understand .
- - You know what ll go great with ll those donuts  Insulin injections

  - They are . They re the only ones seriously fighting them but it does nt seem like they can do it themselves .
- - I never knew and at this point I see no reason to change my view of them . They are my loving Aunt who always brings me awesome chocolate at Christmas .
  - Serious question . does nt she prefer the female pronoun rather than the neutral 
- - Harsh punishment does not act as a deterrent . This is a known  measured fact .
  - Let s bring back the guillotine and see if your theory holds up .
- - wtf is that clown behind big ben 
  - That may be the scariest clown I ve ever seen .
- - What was the hatemail about from egghead  Haha

- - I ve heard that sucking your own dick is more like sucking a dick and less like having your dick sucked .
  - Like tickling yourself . Just does nt work .
  - This is bullshit actually . Sometimes I ca nt even scratch my own feet because they re so ticklish . I have to do it in straight fast scratches
  - Being able to tickle yourself is a strong indicator of schizophrenia .
- - Not sure where he said there s no mass murder . He was simply commenting on how the regular people who are nt in gulags live pretty ok .
  - Those regular people are Inner Party officials and family . This is the equivalent of touring Congress and turning it into a piece on how all Americans are millionaires .
- - Hatoful Boyfriend  Love this game . I die every time though ...
  - You re not being dedicated to one route enough . Stop focusing on your schoolwork in a dating sim  silly 
- - it ended a month and a half ago  and i have another month of break before it starts again . D
  - Whaaat  how long is your year 
- - How you decide when to change into one of your Champion forms  Do you prefer the really fast one or the slow one with boils 
  - Sometimes when Satan respawns me  he makes me better . I prefer the really fast one because I can eat Isaac easier .
- - Keep buying weed  then you can come off the t-break in style next year 
  - Id rather save the money and just buy when its time . Having a stash around would be too tempting .
- - As if we needed more reasons to hate Thatcher ...
  - The economy was in extreme decline when she entered office . Her harsh policies probably helped the U.K. in the long run .
- - Is it technically possible to be both atheist and buddhist 
  - Probably . Atheist means you do nt believe in a diety  and since Buddhism does nt have a diety  it works .

  - It s worth the gamble considering it s only OJ Mayo .
- - This is a cool idea  but would nt it be better if it was a card that can go into any wallet 
  - Theoretically it could be removed easily if it was just a card  defeating the purpose
  - a lost wallet and a stolen wallet are two different scenarios . Its not like its going to give you the GPS location of the wallet .
  - Exactly . I do nt want that leather wallet . I like the wallet I have right now .

  - Well  he never watched the cartoon  just loved playing with the trains . I know what you re talking about  though .
- - Yeah you re totally right on the definition - I meant that coco wheelies tend to last longer because of less friction  and I like seeing them because of that .
  - Aw  yeah for sure . So smooth .
- - Prime wade no question . Hed be explosive and He would bite  kick  undercut and do whatever it takes to win . His drive and will is underrated .
  - Plus  prime Wade was on of the best defenders you could ask for . Prime Wade posted one of the best seasons since prime MJ .
- - Not sure if this is public but him and his wife actually got divorced for a few months and then got remarried .
  - It says as much in the article .

  - Its broken ... the brush does nt spin .
- - I want the artbooks  but they are a lot of money and I still need to buy the Korra blu-rays and the TLA comics .

- - Growing up I always wondered if Aniston knew that her nips were so visible . Also  if the camera men knew  and did nt tell her .

  - Without for a cleaner look . Thank you
- - I hear those types of dogs are supposed to be pretty dumb and hard to make obedient  but god damn are they cute .
  - Shibas can be very stubborn and difficult to train . They re a very independent breed and may not really take to any person in particular .
  - So they re like a dog for people who like cats 
  - Sorta . They have a very distinct personality that is really unique .
- - I hope they do nt trade this one for a microphone .
  - A microphone  Eh  I can see that .

  - I have had treats and cuddles lasting over an hour  I am satisfied for now
- - That s the fight for me now though - Jones has walked through the LHW division  a step up will make things very interesting

- - Where do you go to school  I do nt think my district would have done that .
