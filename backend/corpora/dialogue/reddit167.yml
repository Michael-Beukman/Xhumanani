  - Close . That s Canmore down below . This was taken part way up Mount Lady MacDonald .
- - Looks like it  but that s no excuse for poor trigger discipline .
  - Since it looks like you were there  how was being a tunnel rat in Vietnam 
- - I would Unidan this post if I had the spare accounts .
  - That train s already left  friend .

  - Yeah  neither of those options look great to me so I m not too sad about them waiting out the decision .

  - Or do nt order packages if your wife is nt cool with it . That is fucked up

- - The white ladies are smiling and the black ladies are frowning . Coincidence 
  - I think Death is just plain scared to come for them .

  - Wonder if you can use it to squeeze someone s nipple ... I m trying to find some redeeming qualities here  man .
- - Why not  There s nothing good in drugs .
  - In your opinion . Plus what are we defining as drugs  Illegal substances  Prescription medications  A beer 
  - Illegal substances used in a non medicinal way
  - Since when does something illegal become wrong  Does legality imply morality 
- - So anyone with severe PTSD is forgiven for going around killing people 
  - What are you talking about  No one ever said he should be forgiven . You can still hold someone responsible for an evil action without thinking they are Sauron .
- - That sounds a lot more reasonable than something magical . The brain is capable of strange things . Do you actually believe you can see them 
  - Takes a crap load of practice but eventually people can hallucinate them into the waking world .
- - As quick as you can  go into settings and add comment restrictions to your sons YouTube video . It will block out all the hateful comments .

  - Bird is Basketball Jesus . Allen is just regular Jesus .

  - Not that circlejerks do nt exist here  but what are they 
  - Eesh . I do nt know if I wan na open that can of worms .
- - Durarara . Not the last I finish  but the last I will watch .
  - I ve heard good things  what do you like about it 
- - I do nt think we even have information in what system they are located sooo ... it would be pretty hard to locate them
  - fair enough ... I figured it was a dumb question  especially since I ve never even played the game before 
- - dollars in pockets of the military industrial complex does nt fit as stimulus 
  - No  because that s an extremely limited group  compared to everyone in the country that infrastructure would positively affect .
- - Pretty much lmao . And you know the smoke a coil puts off when you dry fire it  Yea  that s worse than burnt cotton  imo .

  - No way  So glad this was shared 
- - You son of a bitch ... HAVE A BLAST  GO BUCKS BABY 
  - Words ca nt describe how excited I am
- - At least you get the full viewing experience  minus chat  without subbing . The stream quality is unaffected . Still expensive though  yes .
  - might i add to that  that when you sub you get exclusive ingame skins  ward skin  and exclusive icons .
- - I think you might be on a list now ...
  - Probably . Does nt matter ; had sex .
- - Nice work  What application are you using for image acquisition  Do you dither between frames 
  - thanks . I use Backyard EOS . Editing the above to include that info . Going to show my ignorance here  but what do you mean by dither between frames 
- - nice to see someone doing something a little less high-brow with molecular gastronomy .
  - Haha thanks . Everything in the videos looked like some form of high art . I just like drinking ...
- - Try a Hitachi Magic Wand . No penetration and it s the Cadillac of Vibrators .
  - Thanks . She s really more info using it on her clit while me or her does the rest .
- - Falls of a roof and then through a ceiling . Makes sense .
  - Well clearly there was another smaller building that was built by the side of the house
- - I read this as biking contest and as confused at first but then figured it out . Now reading it correctly and need to read content for explanation .
  - I read the title as Bikini concept and I was even more confused .

  - That s actually really interesting  I wish I had known that last night .
- - You could be talking about the reproduction of the toucan in the winter season  i d be interested with that voice 
  - I could  It s normally the kind of stuff I talk about .
- - I think you definitely qualify . They re really lovely  Are they Van cats 
  - One is a Turkish Angora  and the other is a domestic shorthair . Both are rescues 
- - I recommend everyone checkout her post history ...
  - I knew who it was just by the title .
- - Peter Schiff has been around for quite some time . He called the last Great Recession . He does nt really say anything crazy . Just common sense .
  - CIA Cointelpro have been accurately predicting all kinds of things  what s your point  Most of the media is CIA . Why would nt the alternative media also be 
- - Avengers . Age of Ultron . I may legitimately shed tears on the day it s finally released .
  - This  and Ant-Man  And all the other glorious movies coming out over the next few years . I m waiting impatiently .
- - You think a guy as powerful as him could be destroyed by a lowly sandworm

  - Great  You re a good kid . Your mom is lucky to have you . Good luck 
- - All that insect  and it s still got a stinger similarly sized to a regular wasp . Would nt be afraid any more than usual .

  - Where am I supposed to go out of my comfort zone 
- - The very rich do nt use gasoline in their cars  And if you do nt want to pay the tax  you do nt have to buy gas .
  - That was a general statement on how taxes work .
- - Completely agree  the crowd can make or break a show in my opinion and the NXT crowd has made every NXT show more enjoyable
  - yeah except you can usually tell the last hour of a taping always seems dead  but overall love the nxt crowd
- - Wut Edit . this is more of a what how did Rutherford pull this off kind of wut 
  - Did nt panic when Dupuis went down and everyone wanted crazy prices for players  but also did nt wait to the trading deadline when the same thing would happen .
- - ok  thanks your good suggestion  which burn time is short  dry herb pen 
  - wax pens heat up instantly so your session begins right away  so if I m understanding you correctly then the wax pen is shorter

  - Climate sure but celebrity chicks and beaches vs. Inland Florida ...
- - Jim Carrey gets pretty close in Dumb and Dumber .
  - That s the first thing I thought of . Impossible to top that sound .
- - Getting an UR for each attribute and the rest strong SR s would be enough for me .
  - This for me . Otherwise  just have fun while keeping the maximum number of Cleared songs possible on profile .
- - So all of these are real  Looks like I m buying .
  - I hope so . I d love to buy them all and line them on my wall .
- - I m not sure but the easiest thing I can think of is they do nt have to claim the tip on their taxes if it s cash .
  - They could also claim the passenger bailed without paying 
- - How many languages do you speak  how do you get by without speaking the local 
  - I speak Spanish  Thai  and some Swedish . Most of the world speaks basic English so you can get by .
- - Sorry  I just thought it was funny if that was also the definition of a vagina .
  - Well  now I feel bad for being a dick . You do you
- - Not sure  that would be something to ask a mod .
  - Alright cool  I m trying to learn how things work .

- - No one needs to spend thousands ... Are you high 
  - how else do you run everything on ultra max setting 
- - what did you think of those movies  I really enjoyed Django myself . Thanks I ll check that app out .
  - By the way showbox is nt available on the playstore so Google search it  then install it
- - Minecraft would nt be where it is now if it was nt for Youtube  and the people on it . I sincerely hope Mojang keeps letting people make videos .
  - Yeah I would nt even know what minecraft is without youtube
- - lmao . if you cant see all of the flaws in that evidence   then there is no hope for you .
  - What kind of evidence would you like to see  Please share and perhaps I can share that with you instead .
- - Which would include having to deal with commercials .
  - Yea but with modern equipment that s negligible .
- - Wait  so Hulk can lift and use Thor s hammer 
  - He gets more powerful the angrier he is . He was mad enough that he had enough strength to overpower the Magic .

- - well he cheated in dayz and his CSGO vids look really sketchy as a long time cs player
  - What did he do in day z 
  - Spawned things in I think He got items unfairly thats all I know
  - Not to justify it  but I was close to an admin who helped me build a base in DayZ . Also  proof 
- - On my first reading  I read it as Rabia had but now I see how ambiguous it is . I do nt fault her .
  - I do nt get it . Can you explain 
- - Sorry  formatting is nt my best talent .
  - Haha no worries at all . Just was surprising 
- - Were you and aforementioned ex gf already separated when they boned 
  - We were  yes  but that changes nothing . Lies are lies . Promises are promises . Boundaries are boundaries . Apparently adults are nt always adults .
- - I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR YOU  EXPLOSIONS 
  - I WAS BUSY SUPLEXING A SHARK WEARING A BOLO TIE . YOU MAY ASK YOURSELF  WHO WAS WEARING THE BOLO TIE  YOU OR THE SHARK  ANSWER - YES

- - Does anybody know where Cam Newton went to college  I ve been watching but I do nt think they ve mentioned it yet .
  - Did you know Jimmy Graham played basketball 
- - Wow finally one that is nt a blatant effort to offend .
  - God forbid free speech in a comic satire should offend someone
- - That s what happens when you get stoned and drink way too much kool aid
  - So stoned you drive straight into the ground .
- - Valentine s Day . The ultimate Hallmark holiday .
  - Along with Mother s and Father s days  yes .
- - Looks awesome  except for the small droplets . I think they are too small  they just look like dots .
  - Yea  I thought about the same thing . I might render it with larger droplets and see how the result changes . Thank you 
- - TFL is perfect proof that the state does a better job than the private sector .
  - TfL is only the organiser - the services are all run by private companies .
- - What s that weird blue thing above Seattle 
  - We re not sure . Better stay away just to be safe .
- - Good god . This couple turns bisexuals to asexual .
  - can confirm  this photo turned me into gay  then a lesbian  and asexual being and then i killed myself
- - Condemning slavery  when it is in your holy book .
  - Ah  so you prefer the type of religious people who interpret their holy books literally . Interesting ...
- - Get morrowind  its better then oblivion or skyrim as far as story and exploration go
  - Combat could be a lot better though . So pick your poison . That  or get it on PC and mod to perfection .
  - Its been out for almost a year  its a butch to install tho
  - I may look into trying to install it . Thanks 
- - Someone seems a bit sensitive on the casual report .
  - Probably because he knows his casual status is true .
- - So what do we know about Tim Irvin other than he s labelled as Athlete 
  - He s being recruited to play the nickel role for us  and he s the new Diggs .
- - lol  I thought he was exaggerating but you re literally a rape apologist .
  - Ironic that he calls everyone else that  is nt it 
- - this morning my body told me to eat half a gallon of moose tracks ice cream I did nt listen to it  because I m not a moron
  - Yep  and my body told me to keep sleeping instead of getting up for work this morning . I did nt listen to it either .
- - Why the fuck would we draft an RB when we have the Crow 
  - And T West . Both those mofos are good .
- - Since you have no answers  ignoring the questions is your best bet .
  - There is no serious answer to your non-serious question  so I can ignore it all I want .
- - I m willing to overlook this guy s ridiculous dancing AND the fact that he s clearly busting a move to accordion music  but not that fanny pack .
  - that fanny pack is so big it looks like it could double as a back brace .
- - Kids raising kids man ... Young parents just are nt as ready to handle parenthood most of the time .
  - Neither are old parents . Source . Old parent .
- - Jesus . Jones runs exactly like a half back . But he throws like a half decent QB . Is this guy coming up for the draft  I want him .
  - HE S A REDSHIRT SOPHOMORE SO HE S ELIGIBLE FOR ALL FUTURE DRAFTS .
- - northeast . nj . It snowed today  which could be it . I just hope it s Windows problem not my hardware . I ll try safe mode later .
  - Yeah man  good luck . A trick I use is internet through my phone with a usb . Help you diagnose the issue a little further .
- - Very exciting  but we all know by now how woefully underestimated these mission lengths are . Maybe we should start getting better estimates 
  - I say keep em low . That way when we really need something we can exaggerate it so the politicos sign on the dotted line .
- - How is this done  Is it feasible for actual use  Is the teleport controllable 
  - teleport is controllable with this  you teleport if you try to change direction after the dash dance window im not sure i want to keep this tho . its super dumb
- - do nt really understand everyones issues . I get into games completely fine all day long . But oh well .
  - Again  that s find . I m happy for you  but a lot of people are still struggling to find GOOD games consistently .
- - That s amazing . Absolutely love it . Just one thing is bothering me and that s that it seems like his shield is in a weird position .
  - The dwarves are from the LotR wiki  so OP didnt edit those at all  and because of this he has no control over that shield haha .
- - Would you happen to be able to provide the information on who did this tattoo 
  - I did ... Its in the title ...
- - Did you have to look up how to spell acknowledge 
  - Yes i was not certain how to write it correctly
- - When I go about hatting fat people I make sure that they have plenty of fedoras available .
  - lol . dont forget the neck beard and acne
- - But there s no sense crying over every mistake .
  - You ll just keep on trying til you run out of cake .
- - Brazilian news reported that they had the roads to the cemetery fixed yesterday .
  - My friend s mother said she heard they were painting the roads and the cemetery and that he is going to be buried near Jos Mart .
- - What if you become tan ...  The tattoo will stay the same shade
  - Solution . do nt tan . Lots of sunscreen 
- - Good lord . That is a situation where as a GM I would definitely fudge the rules for the sake of the players and the story .
  - For me an out of combat coup de grace will always be an insta kill .
- - What s going on with his left hand  Not really sure what else to comment on  I find this picture weird .
  - he lost a finger when he was younger in an accident
- - Who the hell is buying growlers of macro lager 
  - Looks like somewhere in Birmingham . Who else carries Avondale on tap 
- - I did nt see Frye on the list . Did I overlook them 
  - Frye is generally poor value  and I believe that s why it was excluded
- - I do nt know if she has alts . How would I know 
  - They mention it  I was hoping they gave them to you before you lent them the money .
- - Who cares  Tom Brady s a Yankees fan for crying out loud .
  - A quarterback is nt really a representation of an entire state ...
- - I doubt Sir Paul is broke ... he does like to collaborate and perform though .
  - He s kind of a billionaire . No joke .
- - Ha  there s my sister on my front page again .
  - Ha  there s my sister commenting again .
- - I m just kinda throwing it out there  could the lady have drowned the kid 
  - yeah  the exact cause of death was needlessly evasive . scare title .
- - Unsurprisingly every picture looks like a mugshot from some sex offenders register
  - Some were directly pulled from the registry .
- - I m praying that the person filming is his wife  not his child .
  - Nudity does nt have to be sexual . It just tends to be sexual most of the time in places where it s taboo .
- - It s going to be the new VoC since the Scout Rifle from Crota is basically a PvP weapon .
  - The Fang seems fine for PvE to me  It s got almost the same stats as the VoC  just trades a bit of stability for a lot more range .
- - I want coots up with voracek he s the closest looking player to giroux and voracek
  - Which in itself is a scary thought .
- - Adnan has nt showed any remorse all these years . What s your point 
  - If he did nt commit the murder  why would he show remorse for committing the murder 
- - Bible belt . Most teen pregnancies . What the hell
  - Could be used as evidence to say teaching only abstinence and not how safe  protected sex is not effective 
- - I m sure we ll get an update soon with a bunch of new stuff . I just hope it is nt after the EVA .
  - It will be  at best . There s no way they ll put so much strain on their servers at once .
  - Did nt Gumi release super honor summon on the last day of the TVA  That was enough reason to entirely skip the last day of the arena for me .
  - Not as bad as November hell . IIRC  it was FH  SHS  and TVA .
- - do ya ll reckon mariota is better than manziel and bridgewater coming out of school 
  - As a pro prospect  Better than Manziel worse than Bridgewater .
- - Dude not here . Delete the comment . This is public .
  - Yea  I see that now . My phone bugged out . PM sent your way .
- - No  not really . What set of circumstances would bring you to massacre unarmed people 
  - The belief that the entire planet is going to self destruct if I do nt .
- - Autos have a genetically set life span  so the more light they get the better as they are going to be finished on X date regardless .

- - I m a big fan of the show  but I d love to see Oliver Queen within the DCCU .
  - Yeah I just do nt know if it s gon na work with what dc cinematic is doing . Arrow with a sort of prison break type thing would be awesome
- - Tired of reggies antics . Who wants to trade 
  - We do nt need anything in return for him .
- - What company do you work for  Just a little curious
  - I work for a local company that operates out of Utah  we also have contracts to build for a couple online retailers .
  - That s awesome . Probably one fun job 
  - That kind of pc building is the equivalent to playing the same level of the same game over and over and over again for months .
- - This is one of the reasons I wish we could get a spiderman series  having something like that stretched out for around a season would be great
  - That would be badass to get a series of Spider Man similar to how they ve done Arrow ... Except ... Less corny .
- - i like anchovies . not sure this is meet up material though . good luck .
  - I have no idea why so few people like anchovies 
- - They should give people a month at least  seems awfully paltry . And to think I thought Microsoft was stingy with that stuff .
  - I called you in five minutes early on your break  so to make it up to you I m giving you an entire day of paid vacation .
- - Secret hiding place . Get a human femur and leave it in there for the future .
  - Should help the resell value for sure 
- - Not sure if Panthers D is much improved since our game  or Cards offense is this anemic . Bit of both I suppose
  - Our secondary has improved since our game and overall we have improved
- - Do you believe there have been many world news stories about rapeseed 
  - Not really  I doubt rapeseed would influence the graph . I was just trying to add something to the discussion that could affect the graph that had nt been mentioned .
- - What are the fucking chances . After the messed up special teams sequence  giving Bama amazing field position  and then the pick . Wow .
  - Not to mention the bizarro backwards bounce . This is bonkers .
- - Made by smaller teams that usually love games instead of loving money . Indies are designed by the game loving developers  AAA design decisions are based on marketing .
  - You described it very nicely . Well done  thats actually how it is .
- - I do nt quite get what s happening in that ad ...
  - You think that s weird  watch the video .
- - The director deserves to get his shit slapped .
  - Go stand in the bathroom and prowl .
- - How about you just download one of the several GPS transit trackers for your phone  and check where your bus is before leaving your house 
  - My stop is the third one on the route  within a kilometer of the first stop . There is never GPS data for it .
- - I thought doubleheader was something sexual . I need to get out more .
  - double header is also two sporting events consecutively  but in this case  two girly shows
- - As an American  how can I go about watching the games 
  - ONE World Sports has the rights in the US
- - coffee  every time you get a craving make coffee
  - You might want to use decaf if you try that .
- - I dunno man  this whole scene has to be called something I guess it s just a bad name
  - I think it s a decent name to be honest . As long as people call the other bassy genres from the UK by their more specific name .
- - Go to your doctor and tell him that you have horrible flight anxiety  he will give you something to relax on the plane .
  - And the months leading up to it 
- - It s a choice to not uncover him  not a matter of ability . I am surprised that one jerk dbag did nt spill it though .
  - Which jerk  Not the one who posted the blog a few years back 
- - Why were these not sloped in any way  Seems so pointless to not slope it .
  - Ease of design and manufacture  it s not easy to incorporate sloped armor while keeping internal space with a tank that is suitable for war economy production .
- - This gif literally makes no sense and has no bearing or relation to your comment or the OP s gif .
  - Maybe he just wanted to make you watch a flying cock .
- - Well I m glad there s a legitimate explanation for that because it annoyed the shit out of me .
  - Too bad the Witch s high-pitched scream does nt affect other infected at all .
- - Ohh I want that one too  Looks amazing
  - It really is wonderful  The whole style of it is amazing
- - There s really only one mic . The rest are shopped .
  - I guess they also added a comb filter to the recording to make it more believable . P
- - I thought it would be a compliment  I d be proud to have ribs show . Is having visible ribs something negative 
  - Hey I wasnt offended . I like seeing them too
- - But a person s religion is that which they get angry when it is mocked or attacked . I suppose the difference is knowing a joke .
  - Another difference is knowing how to tell a tasteful joke versus an obscene one  too .
- - Noah was the only starter out that game . And the question about mcdermott maybe starting that was addressed above is assuming dunleavy is out
  - Taj was out that game too . Thibs did nt have a lot of choice .
- - But why mention this at all  It did nt really add to the discussion without some type of visual to correspond with the measurements .
  - Clever  let s wait and see how this pans out .
- - Do nt you like to see your face when you re shaving it  I could never shave without looking at my face
  - They make mirrors for the shower . I bought mine on Amazon .
- - Sure  what do you want to do 
  - Everything . Maybe Cary town or the fan again . Or a club . How about you 
- - Was this staged or not at all 
  - Look at the wife s expression . It starts too early and is too mild . Pretty sure staged .
- - want me to  i can . thatd be funny shit
  - I know this is Melee  but would be great to see Pichu with Little Mac s super armor .
- - Looking at his comment history I do nt think he is a troll  I think he is really just this dumb .
  - Ca nt say I m completely convinced  but I m open to this interpretation .
- - Strict  test is from Enter the Kettlebell
  - Excellent I ll do the test before I make my purchase . Thanks for the advice guys .
- - Syrian National Council I believe . The French starting funding them a long time ago . They re finally getting shit done now though .
  - Oh  so they re a good thing when it comes to my interests 
- - I still find it fascinating that nuclear power is just essentially steam power with a different fuel to get the water boiling .
  - That is most electricity generation still . Wind  wave and solar are the only exceptions that come to mind .
- - I like llamas and I m a big  fat liar .
  - So  you re a female llama then 
- - Not sure I understand why exams were postponed . I d be pissed .
  - because feminazi s always get what they want .
- - Hey look  it s a sub that I did nt know that I wanted  Awesome  I m subscribed .
  - Ha  that was my thought when I made it . Thanks 
- - Just writing your tag over and over in one spot
  - Well I typically  unless it s a throw up  do that so I guess a little of both 
- - Well deserved . One of the absolute best at his craft  and can do anything from rolling liquid to deep neuro .
  - I also love his production skills . His sound design is just impressive .
  - Yup  I really love that bass as well .
  - I notice that wobble and my nipples perk up
- - Oh my I GET a response  I am truly honored .
  - I try to respond to all  even if they are trolls . I wish you well  love  peace and harmony in your life .
- - Darkseid stomps  hard . Then Galactus vaporizes Darkseid for denting his chrome .
  - I m not disagreeing with you  but why does he beat Silver Surfer so badly 
- - no  because its silly to pay that much without reviews .
  - If it sucks then I leave a review and return it .
- - This is beautiful  I love the scroll designs inside .
  - Thank you  The artist have great skills in shading too 
- - So are the Horner post going to start up again  I was bloody happy there for a bit when I did nt have to deal with them .
