  - It s fine  Do nt worry about it . I m basically just trusting people to post something they created specifically for this contest .
- - I believe they go away in the end of the month .
  - I have been having it for along time .
- - Well  maybe Tempest Archers . Lightning Flask  Thousands Cut  Stealth  kind of work with berserk without consequence .
  - I suppose if you re built to not take any damage it might work .
- - I think when it s caused by depression you should nt be so harsh ...
  - That would require logic and rationalization . You re on the wrong sub  bro .
- - All we need is something else to touch that s on each other s faces . If ya know what im sayin .
  - Okay  but this time it s your turn to pull your eye out of the socket .
- - Well if you liked this  I would recommend Highschool of the Dead .

- - For infinite wealth . Farm as many potatoes as you can manage
  - This was my method in last release but not so much now .
- - I ca nt even achieve that level of spray control with my own genitalia
  - The trick is holding close to the shaft .
  - Thanks  Now I m spraying my sweet goo like a pro 
  - Maikelele can give you some more help with that .
- - i dont really like NFL think its a joke of a sport  but that was pretty sick
  - Why do you think it is a joke of a sport 
- - If you feel that way when he comes to visit  I would suggest thinking about how you will feel if he is always around .
  - She said she feels that way after he leaves .
- - You honestly think that Valve has never designed a skin 
  - Keyword - never . Yes  they did them in the past . Do they make them now  No  maybe except the new knife designs .
- - Finally get that reference just watched it yesterday .
  - What is this from  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas 
- - the person sold us faulty hardware . After many attempts to work out a refund  I had to open a case with PayPal . They posted that as a result
  - Then you pretended to be an eBay employee 
- - If he was a good dm he would have adjusted the monster s stats on the fly so you could hit the monster .
  - Unless the party was not intended to get past it .
- - I blame my tablet  not the alchohol .
  - I tried that once but my tablet does nt have a way to drunk text so they knew I was lying .
- - I got one for Christmas . It s sitting on the shelf next my copy of The Silmarillion . It does stain easily  unfortunately .
  - Yeah  I ve been very careful with it though . It feels like some kind of felt
- - I hope his name is a joke ...
  - These are Steam users we re talking about . Of course it s a joke .
- - SteelSeries seems to be what everyone has .
  - Agreed  they re great quality and low price .
- - So the only way your product works is if all manufacturers implement this idea into their products 
  - There can be an exclusive company who would adopt the design for a particular field of use such as oral care  sealant  paints  and many more .
- - There are a lot of people who would disagree with your first sentence there .
  - There are a lot of people who disagree with everything and anything here  including your comment . And mine .
- - No  the cellphone records mean his new story does nt mean anything .
  - What do they show  now that the burial is a different time 
- - I do nt think we re even bothering on defense tonight . I m praying our offense can hold up . I do nt think we ve had one good defensive possession
  - Well to be fair ... neither are they
- - Even if that s true there are these things called relatives  teachers  coaches  friends  etc . Fucking shit this place is so racist .
  - Teachers are mostly female  friends and relatives ca nt take the place of a father in the home and coaches are hardly a substitute for a dad .
- - You ca nt compare them . - DayZ mod is a mod for a finished and complete game . - Day Standalone is still in development .
  - Completely understand where you are coming from . Do you feel like at some point the stand alone will be better than the mod 
- - Well then this will be quite the experience for you . Just try to have fun and let loose . Do nt try to control the trip and just embrace it .

  - I so wish I had my SO take a pic in good light  Alas  none were taken that you can see any of it .
- - To be clear  you mean stainless steel  right  Because the strings they are currently selling are all steel  with nickel steel alloy wrap wire .
  - Yes  I do mean stainless steel . I currently use their hybrid steel set or whatever they are marketing them as .
- - I love it too . Where was the first photo taken 
  - Thank you  I really appreciate it . They were both taken at the same location  just different times of day and different perspectives . Longboat Key  Florida .
- - I m sure Regal can make it really  really hurt .
  - Oh for sure . I thought the question was more from a visual fan perspective .
- - Thank based god we locked up Jonesy for a little while longer . My heart could nt take another Markakis like abandonment .
  - I think you might be misinformed about how that situation went down
- - Lem me guess  Breaking Bad fan  Looks really nice BTW .
  - Actually I am but what made you think of that  And thanks Edit . nvm the song hah
- - I really hope this is a lesbian otherwise that is the worse case of gyno I have ever seen .
  - According to what I read on that tumblr  this hambeast has in fact a penis .
- - Is everybody else mostly playing solo classes like ha and la on your servers too . I notice it especially on the vs side on different servers
  - There s a good mix on Briggs  I think .
- - I never managed to find someone who likes Russians as a Russian myself .
  - I ve met polite Russians  once or twice .
- - I could honestly see some group of teenagers being rebellious and Gothic doing something like that .
  - I did it once with some friends . We are nt rebellious or gothic but uh  was bored .
- - I m starting to really look forward to our first game against Golden State .
  - I got ta get tickets to that game .
- - We have a large open field where all the dogs in the complex go . No one picks it up . It s the greenest lawn in the area .
  - Are you willing to put that up against the hundreds of scientific studies on excessive phosphate levels and bacterial tests 
- - Have a railed up full metal ak that just needs a working gearbox .
  - You got Pics and Price my Friend 
- - Its the worst hand cannon in the game . enjoy 
  - Yeah  I do have the quest for Thorn which I never completed before I stopped playing ...
- - Just a guess  but possibly the driver has two infants in backwards facing car sets and they re really lazy parents 
  - Hey that is fuckin insanely clever  well done 
- - But is destroying someone else s life really a proper way to get back  Is it even worth the time and energy to get back at them at all 
  - You re giving women the benefit of the doubt when it comes to having rational thought processes .
- - Shh do nt let your mom see that 
  - oh man  she would totally care anyways too  man ill be in so much trouble

  - You re not the only one wondering .

  - You know he is a famous porn actor right 
- - Is their a chemistry factor in the game mode  How does it work compared to other ultimate teams 
  - Chemistry does nt affect the game nearly as much as FIFA  it ll just affect whether the linemates get open easier etc .
- - Reported . Get this stalking shit waaay out of here .
  - Was nt stalking . He said it to me once . Not sure how him saying something to me is stalking .
- - Do people seriously still worry about this shit 
  - Not a worry necessarily I m actually just curious
- - Is Battle Royale Chernarus a thing  or is this just one server  I m interested in playing on Chernarus but ca nt find too much information on the subject .
  - its just a dev server atm but should be coming as a normal server soon
- - I like the planet explosions and the big ship .
  - Thanks . I was trying to emulate the explosions from the original star wars movies and quite happy with the result .
- - Damn it s expensive to be a nerd now a days
  - It went out of production in my teens  so prices shot up  especially for entire pristine sets that come with an original box .
- - I suppose we could sue them  but I m not sure it would be worth the bother .
  - It s the right thing to do . Also  it would make good headlines .
- - Follow up questions are the tricky part . Just be interested in the conversation and play it cool .
  - What if it s about Taylor Swift and cats .
- - I always thought it would cool to try and capture the moment via a Google map car
  - Do nt know how is plan that  but yeah that would be cool hah
- - Guess that s why they re reporting from the bleachers and not the Front Office .
  - High school journalists could write better articles .
- - So who wants to bet the alternate voice is gon na be Perfect World exclusive 
  - it does say alternate Chinese voice  so probably for Chinese only  not English .
- - You re thinking of a No Contest . DQ is functionally the same as a win in every way possible .
  - I know . I was just making a professional wrestling joke . Mixing up the rules and all .
- - Well  then I have absolutely no clue  I only guessed Marmot Basin because of your jacket . . P
  - haha  it starts with a p 
- - Ray Rice  Donald Sterling and Northwestern are absent  but our punter made it . Hum .
  - Would nt those be big moments outside of sports that happen to include athletes 
- - The grossest thing about the hotdog goo is that it does nt look like they ve ever cleaned that machine .
  - Yeah it s basically satanic death paste with older satanic paste stuck around the poop chute . I think everything about the machine and its contents is very gross .
- - That s an SEC defense right there . Time for the Tigers to play there favorite quarter .
  - HA  That s called poor ball security  not SEC defense .
- - If he drove a car instead of biking he might have lived . Another senseless bicycle related death .
  - Cycling is pretty much the norm in the Netherlands  especially if you live where you work . A positive thing if you ask me .
- - Of course they begin with the feels ...
  - Hope everyone has seen First Avenger already .
- - Good to know . When I tried using it  it made me do a couple of captcha things when trying to do a search . What was that all about 
  - Prevents bots from attacking  spamming  or finding all the addresses .
- - Do we have such data with age category 
  - Not yet as these are the early results .
- - I think you totally misunderstood the point Of that story
  - I did nt even share the point of that story . It s pretty straight forward though .
- - Yeah like that treaty where they promised never to use torture ...
  - Theres a difference between torture and really  really persuading .
- - Thanks  Not sure how my formatting got messed up .
  - you only used one enter instead of two . you can click source under the comments to see the difference
- - this is probably why people only find one shoe on the side of the road ...
  - Why did the chicken cross the road 
- - and food chain just gets better and better
  - Not really . Ca nt activate it s ability with food chain mana and with stuff like manipulate fate getting access to the Griffin is nt that difficult .
- - This is shitty journalism  to be honest . We do nt do journalism here . Journalism means checking sources  and we sure as hell do nt .
  - We do a focused witch hunt pretty well though

  - They were already announced as the gm s before the authority came back .
- - Alright  I have everything . Let me know once you ve added me  and I ll open my gate 
  - Added you and let me know if the gate is open . D
- - I do nt see any citations . None . This is scientific fraud .
  - It does nt need a citation  it s the original source . Things that use THIS work must cite it  though .
- - There seems to be a surprisingly large number of places around here with the most absurd hours .
  - YES  I was just about to say the same thing .
- - Besides the Nick OLeary non call and that LSU touchdown I d say they ve done pretty well .
  - Or the blatant facemask against Dwayne stanford on the sideline
- - Um I m not quite sure . If you could give some recommendations or tips for that it d be much appreciated .
  - Only real options are a dsp or passives .
- - Well ... this must sound far fetched but many many years ago I deflected a chair being swung at me with a vacuum cleaner .
  - And then smashed the offender with the vacuum 
- - Well  because the slow growers have come in and because by trimming them down you give it the appearance of being maintained and even .
  - Correct  that is what I was saying . Sorry if that was nt clear .
- - Why the hell did you link that you dirty heartless bastard .
  - you know you want a piece of that . she a freak fam
  - She s ugly but she would probably please me in an unspeakable way .
  - please do nt say that about your mother
- - Yes  my server just died too  Gaben is telling us to spend time with our friends  family  or palms .
  - I think ur correct  because immediately after new year all of the servers came back up and seem to be fine .
- - Jesus  that would have hurt . Why did she say it 
  - We got into an argument about how I was successful at my job . Pure jealousy on her half .
- - I d rather see Artosis cast Kripp ... I love Artosis as a caster  he s so wonderful
  - they should just skype and cast games together . Artosis probably should nt  though . He needs to get paid for his craft .
- - Good shit panthers thanks for shutting up these cards fans that popped up out of nowhere
  - Lol like niner fans are one to talk
- - Its totally up to date . Available on the paradox forums and through the steam workshop .
  - thanks . For a while there it looked like it was about to die .
- - I asked because I m European myself and was never taught any certain way . Maps are nt even taught where I live  it should be common knowledge .
  - What you never had tests that made you name every country and its capital in primary school 
- - right in the feels . I grew up with this guy man . This hurts
  - I was talking to my friends earlier today . He basically raised a generation of sports fans . RIP
- - It s a shame that none of Benoit can be viewable because WWE does nt provide a marker for any of his matches
  - It s still on there  you just have to find it yourself ... it s usually easy due to gigantic gaps between match markers
- - I m in New Monarchy  but I hate how my leader looks like a friggin priest or something
  - Priest  I was thinking Soviet Russian .
- - Mom here . For the record  that baby is not breastfeeding in that picture .
  - Agree . Face is just sitting there .
- - Fake  the grain should go horizontaly  and the inside white tag looks fake as well .
  - Thanks man  im tryna get refund rn lol
- - RED IS BAD . BULLDOGS ARE BAD . GO GOOD GUYS . GO JACKETS 
  - What is this red you speak of 
  - Maroon is just poor man s red .
  - You quiet down right now  yhear .
- - I can pay with dogetipbot if you like  so you do nt need wallet access .
  - If I could accept trade offers I would lol
- - I did nt pay too much attention to the panthers when he coached them last season  can someone explain why everyone in this sub loves him 
  - The Panther s underlying numbers vastly improved once Horachek took over last year .
- - Very lovely . We hope the Lego Corp will contribute immensely to the Philippine Economy and its profits to the Danish economy .
  - We thank the Philippines for allowing both of our economies to grow .
- - Make food that you do nt normally make at work .
  - So no more food gras and caviar sandwiches at home  Fries and Mayo hunched over a bin for me then .
- - Yeah its hard to explain  you are right  i should make a breakdown video
  - I would love to see the technicals  just to see how you did it . Something like this might be useful in the future .
- - I was nt talking to you  bud . I was talking to the guy who made the post  who ended things poorly with his ex .
  - ah I thought you were generalizing . Oh and I m not your bud  pal .
- - i believe this is only occurs if your holding a weapon or tool that you can use to attack .
  - yes  but most of the time we have tools in our hands ...
- - I think Lobo wins pretty much every time . Hulk does nt have a reliable way to incap Lobo  Lobo is stronger and his healing factor is way beyond Hulk .
  - Does Lobo have any planet busting feats  And how good is his healing factor  Hulks healing is actually better than Wolverines
  - Lol what  Wolverines healing is way better then hulks . He can regen from a single cell .
  - Hulk has healed from a skeleton too . They both can heal equally in terms of damage but hulk helps faster
- - Awful bots is nt a bug . It s designed that way to prevent kicking people for a bit that would be better than them .
  - Yeah but they should at least do what they re told on command .
- - Not sure about anyone else but every game I ve had since the update has had unplayable levels of lag
  - Absolutely ridiculous  stupid lag since the update . What is going on 
- - Doloshi really has shot this year . Much more of a shot then the top US teams that ca nt go ...
  - If they were a top US team  then they wouldve made it through the US qualifier . Otherwise theyre a decent US team .
- - Cover up a hole in the wall where the water shut off valve is .
  - More than likely a cover for a clean out cap not a shut off valve .
- - Everyone seems to forget the past ... Alabama is a team that can always come back from a deficit .
  - Hell  it is like they did nt watch the Cotton Bowl just a couple hours ago .
- - I wish this was at the bell center bc id love to hear and ole ole ole chant
  - Why  This is hockey  not soccer .
  - Doesnt matter what sport its in its the best song in the sports
  - It s not a song though . It s a chant .
- - But it s hot in Australia  How will i know when short ones are in 
  - Follow us on social media  there are links at the bottom site .

  - Apart from vibing in the jam the level of creativity is just unheard of .
- - West Hollywood that has some great places to eat  such as The Pantry and Canter s .
  - Canter s is like the cafeteria at an old folk s home .
- - Damn I love Taco Casa . Taco lite ... Mmm mm mm .
  - Well  what really does it is their perfect bean to cheese ratio in their burritos ... and their hot sauce of course
- - Relatively similar . I wonder why the Yankees sub does nt have more subscribers . It looks like they did a pretty good job putting it together .
  - Probably in part due to the split .
- - The Book . On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are - Alan Watts . Non-Fiction .
  - I really enjoyed watching some of the videos people post of him on YouTube . Would you recommend the book 
- - What did everyone else get for the last question  Think I messed it up .
  - I got the The Overseer   but I m not sure if that s correct ...
- - Provably not till after the pay period is over at least .
  - Is nt it already over  Like we already got our last paycheck for december .
- - This has nt been there all seasons  right 
  - Just new map . Was in patch notes I believe .
- - For some reason I do nt trust Elizabeth Warren .
  - Liz Warpath Speke em with forked tounge .
- - Can anyone get past the selection screen for choosing your departure month 
  - I had the same problem  it would nt let me go any further .
- - Spring Breakers . Still one of my favorite movies in recent years . Totally unforgettable .
  - It was totally crap but the music was good . Pretty hot actresses and got to see james franco rap and sing .
- - Actually  the Coast Guard is part of Homeland Security now .
  - Whoopsies  thanks for pointing that out .
  - They were also deployed to the Persian Gulf
  - Coast guard is never limited to US deployment .
- - I am an attorney and we can begin a class action lawsuit  respond with name and contact information of effected employees .
  - I m not an attorney and I know the difference between effect and affect .
- - Except for the fact that the food there was all disgusting ...
  - Not sure what food you got  but most of it was gourmet .
- - Lol get ready to waste it all at the school .
  - I went into the school section laden with ammo for every weapon  bombs  health kits  etc . I came out with maybe a brick .
- - If your faith in your Prophet is shaken by a picture then your faith is weak .
  - you know what s not weak  guns n bombs .
- - Can he be loaned to LFC like Lampard to City 
  - He can be loaned to any team really . A lot of players end up doing it from January to March because of when the MLS season starts .
- - This particular incident may have ended  but I fear the nightmare is not over yet .
  - It s the beginning of an age of darkness for France and Europe in general
- - Wait  that s it  Those drives are still recoverable . If you re paying a company to destroy them  why not HD shredding 
  - A power tool s got ta be more effective than some old magnet  duh . Jokes aside  this is some of the more idiotic things I ve ever seen .
- - You forgot to take it with you 
  - Ooohhh i thought it was for cataloguing only . x
- - Moving your pc sounds like the easiest option .
  - I thought about that but there is no other place in the house that would be as good for gaming .
- - I love that this is front page .
  - I love it too  This is my favorite activity 
- - I mean Chelsea won it  ask Tottenham fans about that .
  - Yeah you re right but you have to admit Spanish teams take the EL more seriously
- - Ow  he s holding the wire while soldering it ... is nt that getting a little hot 
  - He seems quick about it and the iron need nt be on a very high temp for what he s doing .
- - Pretty sure seamus kicked out of a ko punch
  - Brock was nt knocked out either  Rowan was moving during their stairs match but Show like sat on him with stairs or something stupid .
- - can we please talk about stephen curry 
  - Yeah  but why is no one talking about Steph Curry 
- - You know his name is not Bill Aims  right  OP does not understand capitalization .
  - The capitalization is fine . It s in title case .
- - Will be posting one up tomorrow for sale if you or anyone is interested
  - HMU . I have been looking for this for a while as well

- - Oh shit  I found a radio feed . THANK YOU TuneIn radio
  - And you probably have better commentators than us ...
- - Thank you  I ve had it mixed up . I thought it was something the bank does rather than its customers .
  - Haha  I think that s just straight fraud .
- - That was actually an extremely interesting video .
  - the cars were going the wrong way all over the place 
- - Well it matters when we are talking about leadership on a football team ...
  - Manziel s college teammates loved him too . So did Tebow s  though he was a failure in the NFL not because lack of leadership .
- - How exactly are co s the bad guy here . Everyone s for other jobs unionizing but apparently co s do nt deserve to make a good living
  - The police unions are nt exactly getting a lot of support in this thread either .
- - You should see all our coin toss banners .
  - We win them so much we take the wind
- - No . It s not optional . You re only allowed to play in NLTP if you go through undrafted .
  - If you ask your captain to drop you  they should drop you .
- - Whitney did nt do crack . Crack is whack 
  - Whack is crack makes you suck on a sack just to get that crack
- - I ve got an even better idea . Do nt get blacked out drunk .

  - Get ready to slap those knees  bro .
- - Did you cake him  What happened 
  - I lost . No one wins against the connection error .

  - I know the feeling . And it s tiring .
- - You have any gym experience before  Looking fucking sick
  - Thanks dude . A bit from high school water polo but nothing serious
- - For the casual fans  this is why reach matters
  - I think it s more of a well rounded mixed martial artist vs a grappler
- - You re going to have to talk to her about it .
  - Also she does not owe you a blow job because you went down on her . There is probably an underlying issue .
- - Lots of people with families do . They make the sacrifice for the affordable house and their kids .
  - Whilst sacrificing time spent with that family . It makes sense but it does nt at the same time .
- - Pretty much every emotional scene in Interstellar ... so many feels .
  - When Murph s videos came through and she slowly gave up on him ... I just lost it .
- - The front of your plate carrier looks cool as shit . Also do nt you get hot wearing all black 
  - I play at Ballahack year round in black . Just a heads up Ballahack is in the middle of a swamp in Virginia ... yeah the summers are not as fun
- - I meant if they intended to kill the person filming it would have been easy
  - That s not how you worded your comment but I see what you are saying now .

- - Ooo  this thread is awesome . Let s go 
  - would you rather eat poison ivy or use it to wipe 
- - I m brown and poor  so I do nt know what the fuck you re talking about .
  - I ve heard of some people saying that and I wanted to know if there was a good reason .
- - They re actually not bad on the mic ... kind of surprising .
  - the material was bad but they had good presence
- - As much as Lindley has nt been playing at a high enough caliber  can anyone tell me what happened to Arizona s stellar defense recently 
  - You answered your own question . That offense has got to be horribly demoralizing due the defense .
- - After having both of my knees dislocated this year  I flinch a little whenever someone gets taken out from the legs .
  - Ouch . How did you do that 
- - Looking like they re going to have to find something to run after this . I reckon a family feud repeat
  - Well they re gon na have to decide quickly
- - In their eyes  The US have a stupid culture .
  - They can judge our culture as they look over the goat and sand dunes if they wish .
- - Were you an assistant manager of some kind of just a delivery dude 
  - Both . Delivering a busted up package is not fun .
- - But ... but then where is Harry going to sleep 
  - Where do you think that door leads to 
- - Congratulations  . D . D . D Any pictures 
  - Thanks  I added some pics to the post 
- - You need to compare it to dreadwing weapon now
  - I compared it to the HA weapon because it s the same item level  the dreadwyrm weapon is a higher item level .
- - Great  so being insensitive to an entire religion is justified 
  - Ohhhhhh noooo  not INSENSITIVITY  How on earth will they cope ...
- - You re technically wrong because birds are a late evolution of dinosaurs . The definition has changed since we were kids .
  - Thats what i said  isnt it 
- - Pretty solid list . I would put Carapace armor on your HQ . Camo netting on any vehicles you can afford it for would be nice .

  - At his age  a MILF is young .
- - you say potatoe  I say potato ...
  - hey that was the guy that told me to buy it 
- - If you mix ketchup and soy sauce  you can make a decent little sauce . I do nt remember the ratio so you will have to play around with it .

  - These are all gayer the Rob Halford .

  - Right  Anyway  you still can expand functionality . It s the developers who decide not to develop for older devices who are ceasing to send you updates .
- - Its not even just him . Almost every opponent this season has tried it and almost all of them have failed .
  - Pick your poison . When we went big we did nt exactly have much success either . You guys are a matchup nightmare .
- - Is this the bloke that leaves all those euphoric youtube comments 
  - Yes  how did you know he was euphoric and spent all day watching YouTube 
- - It s really easy to call a person an idiot on the internet .

- - False  Canada s environmental record is nt too great and it s getting worse . Not sure what part we d actually be in that pic ...
  - I laughed when it said Canada is oil free . We have lots and we wo nt be transitioning any time soon .

  - Hey  if it s stupid and it works  it s not stupid .
- - How I Met Your Mother s Friends .
  - And . The perfect sitcom was born .
- - At first I was about to say that was weird  but after a moment of thought  I can now see this as a completely rational answer .
  - Now that you mention it ... it does make sense
- - Low oil prices are good they said .
  - Well  unfortunately there are two sides to every coin ...
- - Is there a way for you to measure resistance of a foot or meter of wire  That way we might be able to identify it using a specs table .
  - I mean I could build a coil measure the resistance  take it apart and see how long it was and work from there but that s about it
- - People with transgender identities are anomalies too . There s nothing wrong with being an anomaly .
  - There is something deeply hurtful about being excluded  especially when it often happens actively . Active inclusion is far better than even passive exclusion .

  - Thats what I have been aiming for . Vote for Pepper
- - Kinda cruel  but if that was my dog I would pick up his hind legs and push him around like a wheel barrow .

- - This has been a serious issue for a long time  and honestly as time goes on it s hard not to feel disrespected by it as a fan .
  - We re not Pens  Hawks  Wings or Rangers fans  so they do nt care what we feel like .
- - Now we need someone to do it ... for science .
  - I ll do it . Need a bat and a tittie . Can someone fund me 
- - That thing has been sitting there for months 
  - I m friends with the pilot ... they re on their way back from the Bahamas now .
- - We re gon na be pretty fucked when it moves to striker injuries

  - My thoughts too . If the person does it right . Its not necessary to say it every few sentences but sprinkled through out the conversation makes it way more personal .
- - I do nt see why it matters and why people are so butthurt over it . The article it links to is clearly from NASA talking about their astronaut .

- - But you do nt want to come . I get it .
  - No I do . It s just would be ... Awkward .

- - Just as a heads up . That is nt private  because it s open to the public .
  - Yeah  I got the deets on why it s legal screwy . Apologies .
- - Trees planted with the purpose to be made into paper . Also  how wasteful do you think paper making is  That is a small part of one tree .
  - Not sure if you ve heard  but trees are planted to give us oxygen  not paper ...

- - I want to play  but I ca nt think of anything specific I want to know . Can you give me any general advice for the future 
  - Eh  I can give you the good generic advice . Take care of yourself and be kind to others .

  - lol . That s what you get for teachin yer Dawg to drive 
- - God damn  this is so original . How did you come up with this all by your self 
  - The reason people keep reposting is because it s a good suggestion  nothing is wrong  yet riot wo nt follow through .

  - Negative . Just wanted to try a different design with the backplate .
- - I kinda want the rainbow one too  I will think about it .

  - hmm I do nt know why but that sounds a bit personal lol
  - What you said was fairly dickish anyway .
- - That music made it significantly more tense .
  - Sounded like the score from a Simpsons Halloween episode .
- - One fairly big problem is that Barca are banned from signing anyone for a while so they wouldnt be able to spend any money they got for Messi .
  - why is that a fairly big problem  it s not like they have the best striker in the world whom they can play up top .
