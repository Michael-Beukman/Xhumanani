  - Oh  not sure about that . I made mine ages ago so I m not sure man .
  - Thanks for the help anyways  I looked through the ea forums and everyone s complaining about EA s terrible costumer service .
- - I just moved to bend from Kentucky and I ve heard a lot of people move to Texas and I do nt understand why ... what is there 
  - Cheap cost of living and affordable nightlife i think .
- - Well it is generally a rapid in and out thrusting motion coupled with loud yodeling screams .
  - What can I expect from the experience of knifing someone repeatedly in the abdomen 
- - This is the moment that made me go from begrudgingly watching the show to FUCKING LOVING THE SHOW .
  - Ca nt even tell you how many goosebumps I ve gotten from the sheer joy in watching the show .
- - IIRC they never said anything about ending IE .
  - Exactly  this is just a fork .
- - No . It says he forced his way onto the threshold .
  - You sure the onto is nt a typo  Could be into the threshold . Otherwise  why would the police call him a Home Invader 
- - You are the centre of the universe . Everything is expanding from everything else there is no centre or everything is the centre however you want to look at it .
  - I think if I picture the universe as an expanding Mobius Strip  I think I get it .
- - This is a broad question ; The pose changes completely depending on what you are selling e.g . Dissertations on particle physics  or gonzo porn .
  - Yes  you re right . I run a it services company .
- - Happy Birthday  If the other half of your face is as attractive as the visible portion  then I doubt that you ll come home alone .

  - Whoa whoa whoa  what kind of monster do you think I am 
- - I have a gift card to Sephora and no idea what to buy with it . We should be friends .
  - Right  We have to band together  People do nt understand how hard it is 
- - Yeah  shining example getting your brother high during school . Seriously  what the fuck is wrong with you people 
  - You are on every thread with this attitude  man .
- - Hey  are you still taking a pupil 
  - Got someone maybe  but I will take you if you still are looking for someone to help . Just add me .
- - Doesnt it go to another lane if u ping them 
  - Nope . Bots are designed to only work with other bots .
- - The old brick will have voltage and amperage ratings on it you need to match those up
  - We have managed to find the correct voltage and prongs and all that but everything we see says they are for laptops is it ok to use for a monitor 
- - Hey  by the way  what is the script called  I might want to try it 
  - It s not yet approved but it s called A Dark Room Auto Harvester  . Nothing special but it s free
- - CPU Z and Msi afterburner . You need a voltmeter to see the power consumption though
  - Okay thanks . No I mostly why want to see what how much ram and cpu is being used .
- - Ironically enough  that poster is possibly the best demonstration that mental disorders and conditions run in families .
  - Idiocy and evidence denial are not mental disorders .
- - Yes  and prescription opiate abuse is a huge problem .
  - And it s wayyyy harder to produce Vicodin in your garage .
- - Good to see another fan of the Freeing bunnies 
  - They are some of my favorites . They are all just so hot .
- - This is such a weird angle to watch
  - Its like which ball am I suppose to be right 
- - I heard that Finland told Germany to leave their Jews alone and operated a field synagogue for their Jewish soldiers 
  - Pretty much . We were working together against the Soviet Union but that s about it . Ideologically Finland had little in common with the Nazi Germany .
- - Countdown without commentary just does nt feel like Countdown
  - I do nt mind it so much when it s these self-referential ones  because they re still in the video . Just in flashback .
- - What about a can of white spray paint for the power supply 
  - Since its a flexible wire the paint might crack . Im not to worried about it until it has a permanent location .
- - Forgive me for asking  but what gender  if either  do you identify as 
  - do nt worry about it . I m male .
- - They used to show movies on the base in the summertime .
  - Now that s a cool idea  Wish it was happening when I was there .
- - I use the hank hill mii brawler a lot . You should too .
  - Gunna get the Hank Hill Amiibo once it comes out too .
- - If that door next to the barrier pylon was open I suspect you d find it exits out onto a one way street .
  - It s a small garage connected to Carl s Jr. off Sunset Blvd
- - Haha I always enjoy seeing Zero salty after a loss .
  - hes not actually salty but I enjoyed winning lol .
- - Is this from the show  I do nt remember this scene at all for some reason .
  - Yeah  I forget which episode exactly but I know it s from the show .
- - I m on board this Detroit Bandwagon . Holy hell that was sweet .
  - Best story in the league right now 
- - Not a huge fan of DMo . I m worried about Gobert too much I do nt have the courage to fade him . Other than that I like your LU .
  - Thanks man . I ve changed those two to Tristan and MKG . Thoughts 
- - The true porn connoisseur knows that Bing is the one true search engine for this art .
  - search engines are like pornography . everyone has their favorite ...
- - Pero gets way too much hate . We look way better when he s healthy .
  - i hate to say it  but it s true
- - For all the casual ways American media loves to perpetuate the myth that the French are pussies . American media sure is a bunch of pussies .
  - As an American  I would nt mess with French nationalism . Equality  Fraternity  and Liberty really mean something to them .
- - Oh  did nt know that . I do love the wax printers  but that wax needs to be cheaper .
  - I always wondered if I melted candles and put them in what would happen . I was never brave enough to try .
- - I play out scenes from my favourite movies in my head . Sometimes I read out the dialogue .
  - Has the Lion King been one of these films 
- - Huh . I thought that hit on Daniels was kind of late .
  - He was nt down  it should be clean unless it was clearly helmet-to-helmet on a defenseless receiver . Looked fine for a no-call .
- - Keep on warping Islam to be what you want it to be . That will get you far in life .
  - Taqiyya . Look it up . This is their tool of lies .
- - Gary Busey should get his own television show where he just sits there rambling about whatever for an hour
  - He did on comedy central . It was called I m with Busey .
- - Hi I am looking for a Bobcat Engine . I could offer either the blimp body or the concorde controls .
  - So as soon as you add me in Game Center  please send the part  and I ll send the Bobcat Engine . Cheers 
- - When does the booth open  And when might some info start coming out of it 
  - Booth is open now  Already saw a line forming .
- - Nah . I got a wife so I do nt have to worry about that shit .
  - Does nt mean there is nt a laundry day . Just means she does it often enough .
- - Too impatient . This is a marathon  not a sprint . PS Cut the mayo
  - Fair point . I agree  I ll cut the mayo .
- - I actually am on push ups  sit ups  crunches  leg raises  squats and a superman for the back .
  - if you can find a way to do pull ups  then you have basically a fantastic total body workout .
- - Did people not know this . Watch a totally healthy person you love suddenly stop completely and die within weeks and you will know this .
  - Yes it is sad when this happens . But you ca nt really claim anything from observing one case .
- - Normal and safe will slow your progress . You do nt really want to go back to normal though . If you did  you would nt be posting here .
  - That was pretty irrelevant to what I said . lol
- - That is no ordinary task ... you are SUPER human
  - Im not sure if I should take it as a compliment or not . But I ll go with compliment thats more fun .
- - That s kinda funny how the fan translates into liking a breeze . thanks for the insight .
  - That and another outdoor passion is sailing . I like wind man .
- - I sincerely hope you all used a firework at the end .
  - I would ve  but forgot to equip them D .
- - OH cmon like that shit didnt cross your mind when it went to OT lol
  - Honestly i went outside for a cigarette and came back like halfway through their flag cap . I gave up hope before it even started lmao .
- - That s cool  I d like to see a nice long list of all the innovations like these 
  - The inventions of the stirrup and bridle were important . The invention of the bow was also huge .
- - Half the distance to the goal from what line of scrimmage 
  - It was from the spot of the foul .
- - Amateurs setting up electrical distribution networks . What could possibly go wrong .
  - Start a consulting company that comes out and offers advice and technical help to private citizens wanting to do this . There ... now you are helping people and making money .
  - Just because the company exists  it does nt mean people are going to hire them .
  - Well if the company does nt exist they most certainly wo nt get hired .
- - Hey Alex . How re you doing these days  What s got you feeling depressed 
  - Meh . Winter breaks coming to an end and that sucks . Did nt get any chrimbus presents either . And idk  brain chemical imbalances 
- - If your plane went down and she tried getting up in the aisle to escape  she would block everyone behind her off and you would die due to her size .
  - For this exact reason  I request being seated in an aisle seat near an exit .
- - Wow  I did nt realize how important it was to have special pants for bouldering . I just wear some blue jeans and go at it .
  - It s probably fine if it s comfortable and does nt limit your mobility
- - What about some local music  I randomly came across this Son of Ray guy one night . Bought his cd and quite like it .
  - I have nt lived here long enough to know the scene at all ; any punk suggestions 
- - Is there a way to tether a chrome cast to my unlimited att cell phone  I have WiFi at the house but it s not unlimited .
  - You should . Set it to your hotspot  not the home .
- - So because it happens in other games then it should be accepted  This is one of the worst counter arguments I have ever read .
  - This is a poor example . Football games always kick off exactly when they are meant to . The pre-game show always starts earlier
- - I m not really sure if this fits the spirit of Canadian manners monday
  - This is more of a Trash Talk Friday lol
- - I m pretty sure Pym is straight .
  - I m not so sure . I mean  have you seen his outfit 
- - Your calling me a noob  Lol you make me laugh Zeus . D
  - I guess that makes you a super noob now lol
  - Did nt u quit after getting dicked in QM so much 
  - Lol i quit because there were too many laggers like yourself and because the game was boring for me
- - Seriously  the new cardboard box is really OP
  - I still wo nt think to use it .
- - Oh look a country with oil  EVERYONE LOOK THEY ARE TERRORISTS  ATTACK 
  - To be fair we kind of missed the imperialism boat when imperialism was socially acceptable  so now we have to make up socially acceptable reasons to be imperialist .
- - When I click it  it does .
  - Do nt know why . Matrix glitch  Quit clicking it 
- - Wow that is an amazing looking weapon 
  - Yeah zen moment and explosive rounds  Also increased range .
- - I m loving this Kinda Funny Games content . Glad I backed it .
  - I know . I was worried about beyond going away . But now I get their content each day numerous times
- - You . Are . Awesome . I hope you re doing well .
  - i am  I posted an update if you re interested in checking it out  Thank you so much 
- - Oh fuuuuuuuuuck ... Alfie  Instantly a permanent member on my team .
  - Got him today  he s really good . Nasty shot
- - What else would you call making someone work for no compensation 
  - Volunteering  You know  because the unpaid intern has a choice and is nt in chains or saw their documentation taken away 
- - Also there is of course the PSL but with its horrible pencil barrel I would be hard pressed to call it a battle rifle .
  - More of a DMR than a main rifle . I still kinda want one though 
- - BREAKING NEWS . Ethan Hawke only gets flu shots when performing on Broadway .
  - What s breaking news to Opie is not news to anyone else . Example . His lack of a true viral video despite trying over and over again .
- - There have been some first impressions and just over all gameplay videos since early December . A lot of people are liking it .
  - Yeah I ve seen those game impression videos
- - Yes . I m loading the save and hopping on in a bit .
  - Ok . I already prehatched and added your FC . It should only take a couple of steps to hatch .
- - My favorite is when I go to the store and the smokers are huddled at the front entrance kindly sharing their smoke with everyone . Sharing is caring ...
  - Or restaurants  or the office  ...
- - And cab drivers . And defense contractors . Etc etc ad nauseum .
  - I d be happy if selective services was not sexist .
- - Ya  just that blue wire and resistor came loose . There might be more but idk much about it
  - Alright  it should nt be too hard to fix .
- - As I read this my girlfriend is right next to me playing Bioshock for her first time . Haha 
  - I m actually rather jealous of her 
- - nope  it s the same client . once the code is redeemed  launch the game
  - I believe he is asking about how to register his copy of the game with a free trial account .
- - Now I m contemplating getting a stock class with bottom line kit for constant air .
  - It s up to you bud that s the great thing about a phantom so many options
- - Looking forward to these  Good luck 
  - Thanks a bunch . We re excited .
- - Jockey . her flat on her stomach  legs together  with you straddling her
  - A nice touch is to put a pillow underneath her hips to arch up her butt .
- - Next time add bangers ... for my mouth .
  - But here in the states we call it sausage in the mouth 
- - not to detract from this ... but there s already an endless supply of free porn on the internet
  - Not according to the first law of internet . demand for porn is endless  supply is always finite .
- - You could claim anything with that logic .
  - Someone might try  but all I m claiming is that you ca nt point to the existence of news articles about something to prove that it s prevalent or likely .
- - What  I have a reliable source who regularly informs me that she is in fact  made from titanium . This is nt true 
  - It is for those who believe it is .
- - you re not my bro  pal . srsly though  stop this shit with texts
  - Hope your holidays were good to  pal .
- - The companion s radiant quests might cause this . I had to kill a sabretooth cat that broke into a house once ...
  - Same . And I got a bounty for going into the house .
- - I hate all the fake clicking sounds when someone holds up a gun in a movie .
  - Right  Like moving the gun through the air is causing it to crack like it has osteoporosis or something .
- - Can we get a Pirate Party in the US 
  - Not while you stick to the two-party platform .
  - They already have pirate parties over there .
  - But they ll never see the light of day .
  - Does nt mean they ca nt get influence . The NRA and christian moms are nt parties in charge  but representatives still listen seriously when they voice their opinion .
  - The NRA and christian moms only matter because they share republican interests . They are also not even political parties as far as I m aware .
- - Can I send it  because it s just a suspicion . I do nt wan na send a false report .
  - You just have to indicate that u have a suspicion . They will investigate the matter for u. meanwhile you should stop helping him i guess .
- - Sponges . And starfish . And krabs . FUCK YOU KRABS 
  - We re so much better than crabs .
- - Get busy . Have stuff to do all day . You may feel tempted to smoke as a night cap  but you just have to resist it .
  - yeah thats the thing  its hard to sleep without it or you dont get as good of a quality .
- - That you need to go to college to be successful .
  - As someone currently in college  what can you share with me 
- - why the fuck do the refs blow that whistle ... let the play go out and just overturn it  if it is nt a fumble
  - Only problem is if it s called a fumble it s harder to overturn
- - This reminds me of a novelty joke scrim team concept I came up with . Hope you guys have fun 
  - Thanks  What was the concept  if you do nt mind me asking  . D
- - Military service can expedite the process . At every basic training graduation there is a naturalization ceremony .
  - You can get into military service without being a citizen first  I do nt see how that makes any sense .
  - When I was a Drill Sergeant my naturalization soldiers were among the best and strongest .
  - They should be highly motivated  right 
- - I like how the cow never breaks character .
  - I do nt think real cow though .
- - These are all basically the same thing with one layer added or removed . Looks fine  the olive works well
  - Yeah exactly I just wanted to use the same few pieces in different combinations .
- - Should ve done it before Lebron left ...
  - Why ... At least it shows he is nt bandwagon or anything  you rep ya team whether you got a star or not . He s from florida thats his team
- - you really should go talk to the ROTC detachment at your college
  - I do nt go to a regular college  we do nt have an officer .
- - They do nt . I was just repeating the bullshit I hear them say .
  - Oh ok  thanks for the clarification 
- - No wonder  I do nt blame the guy . If I called the lane and someone stole it I d feed too . Especially since it s unranked .
  - well he picked the last and he didnt said anything to us  it just something we those two in party .
- - I agree  we really missed him .
  - Good season  guy . We need an Australian Steelers meet up .
- - the question is why does it exist . Is this sub so overwhelmed with traffic that the technical topics ca nt exist here 
  - Exactly  no one wants to subscribe to small subs like that and it s the off season anyway .
- - I know it was just an example . But they really should get it subsidised  the costs of obesity are higher  and the NHS has to pay those .
  - I do nt think it matters  everyone deserves medical treatment regardless of whether they can afford it or not . But that s just my opinion .
- - Attendance is still going to be bad if they suck  and moving is nt going to make them more competitive .
  - Then I would nt call the fans loyal like the comment that I originally responded to did .
- - Why would you use an iPhone filter through a telescope  Looks like Lomo filter
  - No filter . I just adjusted the shadows  contrast  highlights  and brightness to bring out the colors .
- - Have you dealt with Groudon yet  Kakuna wo nt appear before you do .
  - Yeah  literally as soon as I could I went to the Safari Zone
- - Bringing it up in the context of anything other than itself . It is the reason I have intense cramping - it is not the reason I behave particular ways .
  - As a side note to this question  could you explain the cramping 
- - Well if you re going for the trophy just kill one more dragon in another save .
  - The Guardian of Mythal does nt count for getting the Dragon s Bane trophy .
- - Oh wow that s deplorable . I was only soliciting for FOP donations and just could nt handle asking people for money for something in which they had zero interest .
  - This place killed my drive to be in sales I went back to manufacturing and have nt thought about getting out of my dirty work environment again
- - If only he formed the bridge by himself like the hunter did instead of flying across ... It is still very impressive .
  - I ca nt seem to find a vid of what you re talking about . Can you link me it  Pleaseee
- - What games do you intend to play 
  - I mostly play single player games . Mostly Third-Person and FPS .
- - If you get a different response would you reply to this comment  I am actually getting annoyed at this point lol
  - No problem  they normally take a day to respond I ll keep you updated
- - ominous piano out of nowhere kind of fucks with it for me
  - Yeah really bothered me . HAd enjoyed it more if there was nothing but the live audio
- - Eagle Creek has some good options for travel wallets 
  - Yea some of these are great  I like the hidden wallet 
- - But  but  but ... Juggalo makeup ...
  - True  but when all you re doing is the eye  this is a lot more dramatic then a simple gray and white template .
- - Andy Dalton could not look less interested in firing up his team and figuring out a way to win .
  - He s never really been a leader .
- - My bad . It was posted over two years ago  figured that was enough time in between to share it again .
  - Yeah sorry  the hall of fame rule is regardless of time .
- - It s not SWAT  it s GIGN .
  - i came here to say that as well . geez OP have nt you ever played counter strike 
- - All these sales  I wish I was nt on a no buy . Lol
  - I know  I m working on figuring out which polishes to destash so that I can get more ...
- - Is nt this one of the things that people got angry at Sim City for 
  - Simcity lied about it though by fudging the numbers . Also they were nt really simulated properly anyway and no one actually owned a house or had set jobs .
- - Nicki Minaj  Brooke Candy  even some old school Lil Kim .
  - Do nt touch my hair would be perfection .
- - How big must the mom have been that he could nt move her body  The dude looks huge from the mugshot .
  - Well not huge enough to just take some goddamn boxes up to the attic apparently .
- - Rofl this game is SO RIGGED . Waiting for Cowboys fans to defend that Lions are getting all the calls
  - Lions got away with running into the kicker earlier .
- - Correct . Otherwise they wo nt even know they have a pending snap .
  - The pending snap will be a notification under a friend request list .
- - You are water safari with bibarel and wartortle . Ca nt see the third .
  - Awesome  thank you  Unsure why the third is nt showing though .
- - lmao  upboats all the way  Panda
  - let s circle jerk just you and me ... on each other . not gay not gay
- - Do nt understand why people are still hung up on Lukaku . He s been total shit this year .
  - I second this . Expensive very average striker for an off form team . Terrible fantasy option
- - These women are allowed out and about without a man to tell them their opinions are wrong  Do nt you understand 
  - Note how they highlight the names of all the women on the team  but do nt highlight the male team leader s name 
- - What a crazy design . Makes me wan na play acoustic hair metal covers .
  - Exactly what I plan to do first haha
- - Do you have the drivers from AMD installed  as opposed to generic windows drivers for the adapter  What s up with the wifi 
  - Sorry for late reply  was at school . Anyway  I did install the amd drivers  using the amd catalyst tool .
- - Dangit Luna  taking on ANOTHER story to write  Good luck with this and all your many others  keep me updated please 
  - It s incredible . I m very excited for the Roman book .
- - I m going to take a flying leap and say that you recruit for ComCast s call center .
  - Wrong . Although I ca nt disclose where I work in the interest of privacy  it s not Comcast 
- - Use your swimmers to buy some dinners .
  - Use your cock then invest in stock 
  - increase your wank amount to fill your bank account
  - Cum in a cup for a quick buck
- - what ever happened to the no doxing rule 
  - He is a public figure so I guess it does not apply  plus these images are public domain  which is kind of the point .
- - This is the worst jug build i ve ever seen .
  - It s pretty popular for NEL players . Have seen some on their streams .
- - Do you enjoy the game  If yes  buy it  if not  do nt .
  - Exactly what I was going to say .
- - Anyone recognize the tread  What tires are they  Curious .
  - looks like something they had custom made for this stunt . Deeper treads than any Formula car tire I have ever seen  including rain treads .
- - Anything is a problem depending how you look at it 
  - It s how you look at it that determines whether it is a problem .
- - Speaking as someone not interested in music  yeah they re totally the coolest . I m definitely not in Marching Band . I swear .
  - Nobody in their right mind marches with a tuba when they could use a sousaphone . I know because I know a few crazy fuckers who do it .
- - Do you have a source for that 
  - You can see it on the Intel Ark page for each chip .
- - It looks like you d suck up snow .
  - Yeah I do nt see how you d get any smoke
- - Im sure that the terrorists are not watching the LIVE STREAM SHOWING POLICE MOVEMENTS .
  - I m pretty sure it has a delay .
- - is seaweed weird to snack on  or like shrimp or crab flavored chips
  - Nope  not at all  Those are delicious  Uhhh  now I want to go downstairs and get at some of that seaweed 
- - Yep  i know i should do this
  - You posted it twice ... which one do you want to stay up 
- - unrelated  but how do you like blue stacks 
  - Nothing wrong with it  works fine for some Clash of Clans and Castle Clash for me .
- - TELL ME he just did not just tweet that 
  - This tweet is DEFINITELY in mah FAVE FIVE  DAWG .
- - lol  gg . Props for taking something that was nt meant to be a thing  and making it a thing . How exactly did you do it though 
  - RoboRIO controlled a servo  which opened and closed a valve to control the flow of propane .
- - Yeah I m pretty far behind as of right now but now that I know you re so excited about it I ll start catching back up tonight .
  - awww  thanks  . D No need to work on it particularly though - just do them when you feel like it .
- - You know this will be obsolete in a year right 
  - How so  I did nt realize tattoos could be made obsolete by time .
- - It s a good set  Both players played really well 
  - Yes but this set is already on the front page
- - While a contest could be fun  I m not all that interested in trophies . Why not have gunpla prizes 
  - Plus  their trophies are really awesome . I had them make me a display for a model ship I made once too and it looked just awesome .
- - Not at all  the rifle is for you . Get what you want .
  - I can put optics on later right even with that front sight post there 
- - I refuse to answer  because unavoidable fights are as real as leprechauns riding purple unicorns .
  - Haha  funny except my hypothetical is extremely realistic . I think you re just avoiding answering because you know the answer is nt a desirable one .
- - Is your buddy s name Tyler Johnson by chance  This is typical Tyler .
  - Typical Brian . Maybe they should hang out .
- - That s more work than it needs to be sadly
  - I agree . If you re after comfort and performance in one package  you can not beat a good air suspension .
- - Is that why UFC has gotten so popular in the US 
  - And it will likely follow the same pattern as the US dominance disappears through competition .
- - Primers are nt about being for dry or oily lids  they give something for the shadow to stick and hold on to .
  - I understand  but she made a point that her eyelids were oily and her primer helped .
- - What if I do nt like the neighbours  Can I get an army of these dogs 
  - Probably better to get an army of honey badgers . They ll take care of your neighbors in no time .
- - So pipe up in those discussions . No need to start a new one .
  - Any of the threads that have the slightest of relevance to my situation are from over a year ago and I can no longer join the discussions
- - the implemented system prevents the pauses in the beginning perfectly ...
  - yes  but it takes ages to start the game . and not all show what they want to pick until they pick .
- - Obelisk . Best meal I d had in a while .
  - Yes  Obelisk is fantastic  Does nt get the recognition it deserves .
- - Need popcorn for the unavoidable caliber debate .
  - I do nt mind one way of the other . If it can put a hole in you it works .
  - By the way do you leave the safety on  Seems hard to load silently or take off safety without alerting intruders 
  - My Glock does nt have a safety .
- - I ve killed that treant many many times by now and I ve never seen him drop a necklace .
  - It was the first time he has for me . That s half the reason I thought it was so weird in the first place .
- - Vitamin C method is a good way to strip hair color out with out damaging it
  - Second this . It does dry hair out a bit though .
- - Dude  black sheep  I get it  but that s also a pretty famous clich .
  - That ad is specifically about security and immigration .
- - ok  Arizona ... stop blaming the refs ... YOU SUCK
  - Insult to Injury . Ever heard of it 
- - Am I the only one that is OK with not having kissed someone 
  - Haha nope . Where I was  I did nt want to kiss any of those people .
- - Yeah but we told you so and never liked that guy anyways 
  - People tell me that about everyone . And people tell me that about me too .
- - I would hit up the ol  videogame backlog .
  - A solid year of gaming  sounds like a dream .
- - The most impressive fact is that this kid is doing that in Adidas Slides .
  - Agreed . I can barely walk in those fuckers .
- - How can a dwarf with blue armor kill Deathwing with one shot and without getting hurt 
  - Because he got a beast in his sight  of course 
- - I wish for what would bring the world the most net joy
  - And every living creature on earth slowly starves to death as it s brain is flooded with dopamine or their equivalent .
  - so the genie can make infinite joy a thing 
  - I would imagine so . It can break all sorts of other natural laws in fiction .
- - I ve seen an ios app that can create planets that look very similar to what you have done
  - Oh really  That s pretty cool . I do nt have an ios machine though . Haha .
- - Can you link to the court opinion 
  - It was really long  but you find out waaaaay at the end that it never went to trial . She took a plea bargain .
- - You ca nt expect anyone to take a mirror article seriously ...
  - it s not exactly some kind of secret news ... it s everywhere
- - Judging from his story  he was probably really low and some of his systems were disabled .
