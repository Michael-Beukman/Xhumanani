  - Highlights did not let you down this time

  - Thanks for the generic  insulting comment 
- - It s funny  I like the mean marriage candidates the most  haha  It feels kind of like a challenge to win their affections .

  - I wish the military industrial complex cared about soldiers after war .
- - Yeah I totally want us to track the leaders of our allies via GPS without their knowledge . I want their phones tapped . Telling them about it was totes treason .

- - What would I need to upgrade  Both video card and processor or just one of them 
  - the processor is fine  your GPU is just getting a bit too old for AAA games .
- - It cheapens the love and ruins the nostalgia . Like watching your favourite movie  cartoon and tv show as an adult .
  - That would only make sense if they never remade movies  cartoons and tv shows .

  - True . I have many stuff  much accomplishment  wow .
- - I should watch The Office  should nt I .
  - Yeah you should  It s my favourite TV series .

  - That was nt hate speech . It was simply speech that was hateful .
- - I do nt think Rag would fit into an aggro deck .
  - true  i think I ll sub that with another worgen
- - You re right . But what can she do about it  aside from taking action against him  Or is that what you re trying to say 
  - She could at least report it to the people holding the conferences each year . After all  he s using their event to troll for victims .
- - True but that s not how it should be .
  - They do nt think it be like it is  but it do .
- - why skrillex he s prolly a nice guy if u get to know him
  - He is a nice guy  but dubstep is just too heavy and its entire scene is too much for some people .

  - Lol I think so  he was making perfect sense for me . I do nt understand what the issue is .

  - If they did then fair enough . I withdraw my complaint and apologise .
- - I m making Jack this winter by freezing the water out of my apple and concord wines . The way the pioneers did 
  - I did that last year . Ended up adding some cinnamon sticks and honey to make it palatable . It was super sour .
- - Then it is not racism . It is bigotry at worst  and justified hatred at best . Just not racism .
  - Still racism . The term does not apply only to ethic race .
- - Pornhub is getting a spike in traffic from Tallahassee .
  - Oh  they re airing this live  
- - Tagged you as nice guy . I will give you credit when I see you .

  - I ve always liked eating at Taza and only recently discovered they deliver .
- - Still need teachers in florida and other stupid places . Not everyone can up and move for the better job .
  - Like all good republican wet dreams  eventually only the underperforming teachers will end up in florida .
- - Fucking hell that Roy Hibbert and Kwame comparison ...
  - I m assuming this was when Roy had that really bad slump 
  - yeah when he was really under the microscope  was pretty dumb
  - the pacers are nt in contention this season and he s not under the microscope  yet he s playing pretty terribly again this year ... after a hot start too
- - That may work in a legal state  but a lot of us do nt have options when we go flower shopping .
  - You re going to have a better time getting medical . Legal shops do nt specialize in CBD s and actually have a minimum required THC amount .
- - You made Ciaran cry   You monster 
  - And then I chopped her to bits with my man serpent great sword .
- - YOU do nt . You send it to someone who knows what they are doing .

  - That s why I just do nt argue . You want to pay  AWESOME
- - What do Inter fans think of this 
  - I d cry seeing him in black and white .
- - Spiderman punches her once and her head explodes .
  - When has Spiderman ever  in character  punched someone in the head to kill them straight away 
- - I never said that  the fact is a country that bans it s people from having lumps of metal because it presumes their guilt is not free .
  - Or maybe there s a correlation between gun ownership and gun related incidents  which most countries have an aversion to .
- - I did nt see what the other guy said but is there anything preventing this from working with NVIDIA cards 
  - Nvidia supporting it . Which they wo nt because they have G-Sync .

- - I m not hoping to be recognized . I m working to succeed regardless of the any and all factors in my way .
  - What  You are not hoping for the full rights of a human being and a citizen of the US  Just ... gahh  okay dude .
- - Does this mean the Invincible Pony trick can be done again  Do the Ponies still work like that 
  - I am pretty certain using the pony now instantly makes you rush instead of waiting for you to choose a direction
- - Like  say  a gun for example 
  - Didnt you hear about the black teenager who got shot because he pointed a toy gun at a cop 
- - You wo nt have to worry about tickets selling out . I do nt think Bonnaroo has ever actually sold out
  - It has but not until the week of the festival .
- - It can be yes . You think the cartoon is at fault for the hatred 
  - Among many things  yes . Yes it is . I m telling you how it is in reality . All it s doing is adding fuel onto fire .
  - And so you are assuming in this statement that the fire is a negative thing 
  - If you like hatred consuming the world  then I guess not . Just do nt regret it later .
- - yeah except its not a magic pill that makes all those bad feelings go away
  - As a medicated individual I completely understand that . I m just speculating on a pitch . Beats me  was nt there  hyperbole is easier .

  - For sure ... That was some good writing and acting ... Favourite episode 
- - Nova Prime . Mesa . Rhino Prime . Honorable mentions - Limbo . Just because I love his appearance and his concept . Waiting for DE to give him some changes .
  - Yeah  i love Limbo concept and appearance  but i think he needs a bit good changes .
- - Overhearing my mom say that if she knew her marriage to her dad had failed then she would have aborted me .
  - . Pat on the back . I m sure she loves you  though .
- - You can see the big chunks of potato in there .
  - Where  Those are radishes  bro .
- - Game devs do nt waste the time dealing with Apple s narcissistic bullshit . As a former mac user  OSX offers no advantage to anyone .

  - I think it depends on the delivery . I d have to see it live before I judged it i think .
- - Semantics but I think the gap is wider .
  - What you think and what is are nt always the same thing . Do some research on this matter and get back to us .
- - How many libertarians does it take to change a light bulb  None . The free market will do it .

  - I have no experience with overclocking  and I do nt have the money to buy another processor if I fry the first .
- - Mate you have to have onions you cant have it without onions .
  - I agree . A hotdog without onions is not a hotdog .
- - Reading this thread  I get the impression that if Obama even farts  he would be blamed for global warming due to methane in his farts .
  - It would nt be that he farted  it would be that he farted  then denied farting and accused the Republicans of farting in an attempt to derail his legislation .
- - How warm is the pendleton blanket  I was thinking of getting one for this winter  much colder than I thought .
  - Very warm . I live in Chicago so it definitely gets a bit chilly around here .
- - Trying to hurdle someone and stepping on a player twice after they are removed from the play are two completely different things .
  - Trying to hurdle over someone while deliberately planting a foot into the players helmet .
- - One problem with this . Trans man and trans women are not their own genders . Man and woman are genders . Cis and trans are gender orientations .
  - got it . that s the vocab  yeah . i was trying to simplify it .
- - I was referring to the symbol on the full map when you zoom in . It shows areas certain animals are .
  - It does nt show elephants though . I think because their skins are nt needed for upgrades .
- - Gordon Freeman Smart dude  is quiet  and if anything goes down in the office I can count on him grabbing a crowbar and going to town .

- - That guy s Islanders Rey Mysterio mask was LEGIT 
  - Yeah his kid looked super excited about it .
- - Yeah  fuck all of us veterans who proudly served with that arrow on our sleeve .
  - I think it s a little harsh to put it in such malicious terms . I think the mental healthcare in this country fails veterans more than anyone else .
  - And yet still want to take that park away from all those veterans .
  - Oh quit the melodrama . It s a park name  not retirement benefits . They re not banning veterans from the park .
- - Who exactly would he or she be showing their talents to based on your current television deal 
  - We have no current television deal - but are actively working on a potentially big one

- - This is one of the few Seikos I ve seen that I do nt hate .
  - Thanks  I ll take that as quite the compliment .

- - as someone who likes riff raff i just like him because he s funny  is he a bad rapper  yes  does he make me laugh  yes .
  - He s a bad rapper but he makes songs I really like . I thoroughly enjoyed Neon Icon  and not just because I thought it was funny .
- - If you ca nt cum in er  cum honor .
  - He offered his honor . She honored his offer . And all night long He was on her and off her .
- - Thanks for the help  Just took my test today and this can finally be all behind me . Hope you have a great day . D
  - My pleasure . Best of luck with your future studies 
- - Update . Lounge did nt draft and cancelled the game and are planning to return the items 
  - Good for CSGL . They made the right move .
- - Phones can still make calls these days 
  - No  that ca nt be right .
- - Marcus Mariota as the Harbinger of Doom ... I m strangely ok with this .
  - That s who this is  This whole time I thought it was Reggie Daniels
- - What s stupid about wanting to sit outside and eat your food without someone else s bad habit stinking up the air  Sounds like a reasonable expectation to me .
  - Because if there s a smoking section outside  you ca nt be guaranteed that the smoke from those people wo nt waft over to your section .
- - It s probably lender paid PMI . If you re interested  get an actual good faith estimate from them and see what s on it .
  - What could they possibly gain by doing this 
- - I m sorry I missed the opportunity to have the sub sponsored by paycoin .
  - The fact that you considered this comedy gold in hindsight is enough for me
- - Do you have any idea how much Shaw employees have rubbed their nipples because of you 
  - Nipple rubbing only works if you ca nt swap to a different provider . Which I ve done .
- - Playing on PC with Xbox controller  I do that  and the reset button is A after I die
  - He means a quick reset that does nt require dying .
- - Can you still play them on other people to mess with them
  - You know  that s never come up . Lol . Will have to think about that  but has nt yet

  - No need for pics  the list sounds like just what I m looking for . I ll PM you my address . Thanks 
- - What do you mean they will straighten out the nigger problem by then .
  - Mexicans hate niggers generally speaking . There are places in California where Mexicans have forced the niggers out .
- - I think the cover looks absolutely fine . I do nt get why people dislike it .
  - That was my opinion as well but hey if I get offered a better one that will make it sell  why not 
- - That was pretty fast to complete . Hope I could try Hawaiian coffee in the near future
  - I ll be sure to sent an invite for complementary drink once i have everything in place . Thank you for taking the time to conduct the survey .
- - I ll pull up a video of ocean waves to listen to sometimes  sometimes I ll listen to a guided chakra meditation . Rest of the time just silence .
  - Yes same with me as you can see in the vid I posted . But as to the comments below I will now also try to do without .
- - When I see a couple in public and one partner is clearly more attractive than the other . I always judge the better looking one . Insecure much 
  - I just assume that person cares more about personality than looks .
- - Interesting to see that EU contributions are on the bottom of the list . If you read any tabloid you d think it was at the top ...
  - The only reason they are on there is because this is a propaganda piece .
- - Song of ir yut drops on normal . I ran the raid with a guy who has it last night
  - He s saying Ir Yut will drop gear  shards  etc after killing her . He s not talking about the LMG
- - I maybe a little behind updating links today since I m sick but will do my best to get to them .
  - No prob guy  youre awesome . Ive been sick since monday  could nt even play till yesterday  the concentration hurt my brain .

- - It s the longest of long shots  but did you check with the Germantown PD  They ve got a ring with no owner ...
  - Yes I did no luck . Thanks so much though 
- - Did I by accident just send Butts to actual Obama  This is huge 
  - He ll finally get to see the true value of buttcoin 
- - Damn fred  he just asked for a cigarette .
  - Cigarettes have gotten expensive  even in the hood .
- - I talk to my mom all the fuckin time asshole
  - Your mom is nt an actual female . She s just a giant whore .
- - wade mcbob lebron bosh whiteside . oh what could ve been ...
  - Could always be on his way back if he s impressed with Whiteside and Napier ...
- - If you packed him would you sell him for cheap  Or would you sell him for as much as you possibly could .
  - And what s the benefit of selling him cheap 
- - That s fantastic news  So can water get through the speaker grill then 
  - I m assuming no . Has nt looked like it and the speakers are still working as well as they did before it took a bath .
- - It s part of a previous series of plushies that was released before XY even came out . The other squirtles were released around the time of XY .
  - Interesting . I was really wondering why that one looked so different than the others .
- - I lot of people do nt give a shit about anyone else until something happens to them and they need support .
  - A lot of people are for or against something until it affects them directly
- - i did nt take a looka t your replay yet  but hey man where is your gold item
  - I sold it . I wanted talisman but then the game was quite over so I went for spooky ghost which I didnt finished . I had spellthief at the begin .
- - But he actually does stuff . Tackles  intercepts and wins headers . Flamini would just point at someone and tell them to do their job .
  - Exactly . Every opposition attack just seems to pass by Flamini whereas Coquelin is actually involved .
- - Wow this is one of the heaviest photos I ve seen in a while .
  - Agreed . Some simple things are just really powerful when you see them .
- - Salt is more than plentiful ... there are literally oceans of it .
  - Yeah  Jesus had to walk on something right 
- - why not release one  ransom the ones with landed relatives  and banish the rest 
  - This event does nt give you just cause for banishment IIRC - you d wind up with massive tyranny penalties
- - Plot twist . OP used to work as sushi chef .
  - lol never have a worked in the restaurant industry . would not survive .
- - You know what you can go fuck yourself
  - You know what you can stop being wrong
- - If you pay for any of these things via credit card  it seems like things would get a bit muddled with your daily checking balances .
  - Good point . I do nt really buy anything on credit . I use a credit card but it debits straight out of my checking .
- - Upvote because I would like to know as well .
  - It was kind of a retarded post . I even down voted it .
- - You ca nt pick and choose  though . Either speech is protected or it is nt .
  - of course we can pick and choose . that s why certain types of speech are illegal .
- - Agreed . And McCain is starting over Taylor now  I believe .
  - I certainly hope so  given their recent performances . I was just going with the depth chart on the team website .
- - I ca nt help but feel like this is a weird theme with node . Reinventing tools that already exists in a worse way .
  - That s what happens when you get too far away from the core ... you forget there is a core .
- - Damnit . I fell for the troll .
  - I even called it out . Im not so good at this .
- - Of cause they ca nt show evidence  there was no historical jesus .
  - Even a fictional character can have stories set in real places though ...
- - Well  you were pretty much spot on .
  - Except that the ratings did nt go up after Korrasami happened .
- - Why did nt this happen last spring 
  - So Shanahan could keep a scapegoat around .
- - Very cool  I hope to see more of your work here 
  - Yea sometimes you get yelled at  sometimes people like you  it s hard to submit regular og content
- - You re right . Even Tropes lumps them together .
  - That s where i went first . I knew what an Electra Complex is and I want to know why  dammit 
- - The mouse cursor will then be renamed to a reticle  and all backgrounds on computers will be of Master Chief .
  - Do nt forget your complimentary arbiter logo for Microsoft paint and the exploding flood for the recycle bin .
- - I sure hope said relatives are funding this replacement .
  - Nope  its not a big deal and i m not going to ask them for money .
- - A shovel has two use . to dig something up and to bury something . So tell me  what does this do to justice 
  - I assume it buries people in it .
- - Oh thank god . I thought I missed him getting diagnosed with a terminal illness or he had some sort of personal tragedy .
  - Do nt worry . I was doing the same thing .
- - If it was one of the bundles with a download code for the game then he could nt do anything
  - The GTA V bundle comes with a physical copy of the game .
- - That big nug looks like its made from glass . Beautiful enjoy .
  - I still have nt touched it . The other ones have been smoked . RIP beauties .
- - Benefit  Now  there s a name I have nt heard in awhile . Is he still making music  I still giggle when I hear the Gordo song 
  - If I Owned a Midget is classic hip hop
- - Why is the fact the he was deported from Ireland relevant 
  - Because it was in Ireland he was seeking asylum  simples .
- - DO you think we ll ever get the silent gildarts chapter 
  - The one that had no text  Unlikely considering GMG is already over . They kind of missed the chance for that .
- - Not to mention the most abusive ally they ve had .
  - Are you talking about Russia  USA is corrupt to its bones  but I do nt remember them occupying and ruining my country for decades like Russians did .
- - The last couple of weeks I ve just ignored RAW . I might give this one a chance .
  - The last couple weeks have been better than normal .
- - The spell was probably silver bolts from the fighters guild
  - This  its a very small crossbow  might look like a gun to some .
- - The ability to undo anything that happens to me .
  - Only on a monday  because mondays suck
- - Wow  you guys are just fucking stalkers .
  - I actually only noticed cuz I made the cartoon .
- - Somehow my cart got filled with copious amounts of full size shadows ... I wonder how that happened
  - It happens to the best of us lol
- - Wow . I just had a look at fatpeoplehate and they re a bunch of angry people .
  - Yeah  we ca nt stand fat people that make excuses while trying to act like there is nt anything unhealthy about being a hamplanet .
  - THANK YOU . Ugh I hate the fact that we get down voted into oblivion in other subs . The delusional mindset of these people is terrible .
  - Haha yes  we re so delusional . It ca nt be that we do nt feel the need to make fun of other people  right 
- - Calling them terrible would be a bit strong . Most people do nt know how to get the most out of rangers .
  - I completely agree . Anyone who thinks they re bad does nt know how to play them .
- - You did nt take our advice . This is what happens when you do nt listen to what the universe is telling you . Listen to the universe next time .
  - Sorry ... I thought the car accident was a sign from the universe to do what is right by taking care of her parents .
- - I m digging your beard . I hope to have a beard as great as yours one day .
  - You have to believe in yourself . You must have a strong inner beard .
- - That gave me a warm fuzzy feeling inside . Good thing too  as i was seconds away from death in this freezing cold British weather .
  - New England is nt fairing much better than Original England .

  - Thank you  happy new year to you too 
- - In case anyone else is curious  this is from Ted
  - Oh  and it reads column to column . Took me too long to realize .
- - People like to hate hunters without even attempting to understand hunting .
  - It s just ignorance . Some of the things being thrown around in this thread are nearly unbelievable .
- - Everything that costs money affects the poor more . What can we do about it  Poor people immune from traffic laws 
  - Give them money  obviously . It s the only thing that mitigates poverty .
- - The number of people on this site that get upset because someone else said something mean on the internet continues to both concern and puzzle me .
  - Congrats . You are a normal human being .
- - The only way to kill a Nokia .
  - Honestly it would probably still work edit . lol you faggots have no sense of humor apparently .
- - I think it s Knife Party as far as I remember .
  - That seems more like an obsessed gf meme
- - I m kinda leaning most towards the full blown motorsports base kit

- - I think you could ve given her a little more support but I do nt have a leg to stand on .

- - Yup  do nt want those kids to have any innocent fun .
  - Ca nt let your kids get dirty man . Clean kids have the most fun .
- - That red color is nuts . It could be its own color crayon .
  - Haha indeed . I am happy he s still around . All my others from my original group have passed .
- - I was attempting to continue the running joke . I know who Melvin is and he still has nothing in common with Sterling Moore .
  - I forgot Stewart made the INT . Sigh .
- - Wo nt a mass spec give you the exact mass  And if you have the fragments that you expect then that is probable evidence .
  - Have the exact mass already  have nt done any fragmentation though  I ll look into it . Thanks

- - That sounds right  since I was able to order the gamecube adapter from Bestbuy s warehouse .
  - My BB refused to place a warehouse order ... bunch of jerks
- - Not locking on means you ca nt always block in the proper direction since the souls games lack the ability to strafe .
  - You should nt need to block as often when you do nt lock on .
- - How the hell do you keep your office so clean   Mine looks like a paper bomb exploded .
  - Ha  I ca nt stand a cluttered work space . Makes me feel closed in .
- - You like to see homos naked . That s cool  man .
  - Joke s on you  I m a lady .
- - Verification  anyone  Comments  Legal 
  - Pretty sure he is the one selling them
- - I was worried this would be some sort of confession in cheating in a race  That would not have gone down well ...
  - I used clickbait for evil  but I just had to brag about it

  - To what end  You feel better and other people still suffer  Sounds amazing  I ll try it .
- - I m hoping Lee Nguyen gets an upgrade .
