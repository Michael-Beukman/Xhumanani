  - okay  i mean i guess i can sell you the code 
- - Kermit is a leader character though  so Aragorn would fit him quite well
  - Although Kermit as Frodo opens up mrs piggy as Samwise . Would be hilarious .

  - Yeah  my team agrees as well . Focusing more on the totes .

- - Reading the blurb of what that movie s about  and seeing the cover picture ... there is nothing about that combination that does not disturb me .
  - Wait till you actually see the movie ... Neither the synopsis nor the picture do justice to its level of disturbing .
- - If you pull up beside an NPC s vehicle and block the passenger side door you can have a cruising buddy anytime
  - I tried this and the NPC pushed me out of the drivers seat and got out
- - Fair enough  I concede . Though my original point was that the lack of ambition to lead does not always make for good leaders .
  - Yeah  you need to know what to do  but not really have an inclination to . Poor Nikolai should have been a constitutional monarch .
- - I just like the tiger . The tiger is awesome . I wish he d be there with me in Kyrat ... Future DLC addition maybe  i hope so .

  - No this is the trailer for the poster tease
- - oops  well it is too late now anyways .
  - I do nt know why the mods have that stupid rule still in place . It s never enforced and only sporadically used . All it does is spam automod messages .
- - This would involve divulging my tastes in pornography  so er ... no . Not at all .
  - It s nothing out of the ordinary . None of that kinky stuff floating around the internet these days .
- - get a payday loan . Yes  they re terrible  but desperate times call for desperate measures
  - Do they give loans to unemployed persons 
- - Does it matter what genders the characters are 
  - Only because the makers are pushing it as a selling point or a risky decision that they want to prove will play out well .
- - Would you rather live life knowing exactly when you re going to die  or not know at all until minutes before 
  - I think most people already do nt know when they are going to die  but hey what do I know 
- - The dj at our local radio station signed these guys .
  - NO way  He made a great decision .
- - I think vending machines have existed since roman times ...

- - If you re feeling lower back pain rowing  you are doing it wrong ...
  - Lower back pain is the most common rowing injury ...
- - Goku would stumble into a way to beat Lex . He d fall backwards into a wall trying to get in line for a buffet and somehow expose Lex .

  - How do you insta inbetween sets then 
  - photographic memory . i draw my selfies when i get home . it s the ultimate filter .

- - maybe it s a Darwin thing  never seen chilli sauce available at a sausage sizzle . It s always tomato sauce  mustard or BBQ sauce .
  - You see sweet chilli on occasion  but I ve never seen hot sauces .
- - I wonder what the loadout is for slayer 
  - I believe they are doing assault and BR starts .
- - Can I cheer for a meteor to hit the stadium 
  - I actually like the thought of that more .

  - Unless you have a Neilson box it makes no difference . But im more curious what you like about her .
  - You can have opinions without being a jackass  you know .
  - That s not a jackass statement . The idea that Alicia Fox is good just shows how low standards are for women in WWE .
  - Yes  saying that other people s opinions are objectively wrong is a jackass statement .
  - When did I say someone was objectively wrong 
- - I think I have that same Leather man . Does it have a clip on the back 
  - It did nt come with the clip  but I have the attachable one .
- - We have two front doors for reasons like this . The standard wooden one  and a steel mesh door in front of it .
  - I m going to start locking the outside one ...
- - thanks  plenty to look into there . Now if someone could tell me what to do with my defenders this would be a surprisingly successful post
  - I m on the Pulis defender bandwagon at WBA  and I like Wisdom . So I say stick with him .
- - How are players getting dehydrated  Put them on fucking saline drips .

- - You re very welcome  Props on the moon ball choice for your Numel . D
  - Thanks  People are sleeping on that Moon Ball Shiny Camerupt .

- - Out of all the replies this was the one that cracked me up the most . It s just so unreasonable .
  - But given the rest of the movie ... would nt have been too surprising
- - I did nt mean it in a mean way  I swear to whatever deity you believe in . That I did not mean the question to come out that way .
  - haha  no worries I am referring to the comments by your friends not you . P

  - In my fantasy I had received justice without calling the cops . Real life you d prolly call the cops yeah
- - Suite Life of Zack and Cody  Ashley Tisdale s character 
  - Pretty sure this is it . But I ca nt find a clip on YouTube to confirm
- - If you have a TV with HDMI input but it s not a Smart TV  then the Amazon Fire Stick is rather cool at that price . Instant smart TV .
  - Yeah Fire Stick is on fire right now .
- - That archive literally made the appraiser s nipples hard .
  - Man  you had to be looking very hard ... and yes  I went back to check .
- - Simultaneously Descending from the ceiling all dressed as Crow Sting to prevent an Authority Rumble winner .
  - That s awesome . Very V for Vendetta .
  - I was going more for building the hype around Sting as a vigilante while giving the three of them that rub  but that would work too .
  - It was just a comparison  I m totally on board .
- - John does nt call the plays . It seems to be a Kubiak thing because I do nt recall it being a problem in previous seasons .
  - It is a Kubiak thing . The problem is that he is trying to get everything done without letting the QB audible when he sees the defense .

  - I HAVE TO WORK TOMORROW OR MAYBE I LL NOT GO IN I DUNNO BUT EITHER WAY WE SHOULD BOTH BE DRINKING MORE AND YA DUNNO WHY WE RE YELLING .
- - Serious question for Miss St fans ... How much of this defensive performance can be put down to Collins leaving as opposed to it being the triple option 
  - Definitely a fair bit  but I think a lot has to do with the end of the season . They have just been defeated since we lost to Bama .
- - IGN has always given great reviews for POI . Everything else that is nt a video game is usually terrible

  - Broke both your arms  I m sure your mom will take good care of you .
- - Which has what to do with custody

- - Haters gon na hate hate hate hate hate . I m just gon na shake shake shake .
  - Lol  be careful with that hard disk though 
- - Deer should have been allowed to finish the job  hunting skirmishes should always be quick rather than be made protracted and painful as happened here

  - I m assuming he got an another job .
  - Yeah but that s still running away from your problems right 
  - If it fixes the problem and you re happy then I do nt see it as a bad thing .
- - I ve been running doomguard in my handlock to mitigate losing cards to a full hand . That s my play around .
  - Lol so you burn your own cards so they dont have to  Well played

- - That is nt a custom at all ... It is something terrible that happened in our country but has nothing to do with being British
  - It s an extreme situation for sure  but everything I hear makes me think the British are weak against certain cultures trying to take us back to the stone age .
- - XCOM works fine if you sideload it . I was playing it earlier . The Banner Saga is another great game

  - Its usually been pretty slow during Naruto though .
  - Funny . I always thought Naruto was Toonami s bread and butter .
  - And Bleach . In it s current run .
- - That sounds like salmonella or something similar  not a reaction to not eating meat  especially since you are pescetarian .
  - Yeah  it s definitely possible . But certainly enough to make me more cautious in the future 
- - So Adam Lane runs the ball down their throat and go QB run and a pass play on the next drive  wtf
  - I m sure this will get blamed on Muschamp too .
- - Classic case of fuckarounditis . If you are making progress why cut yourself short 
  - I m not  I just wan na try some new stuff

  - Looks like you and I are the only ones haha

- - Sam and Joe slackin off  do nt even notice Bruz out of the net haha
  - Haha  I love how he apologized .
- - Shoes . I wo nt take you seriously if you wear shit shoes .
  - It s also a metric women judge men on . I know a few girls who look straight at the quality of your shoes after they evaluate your looks .
- - I think looser clothing will continue to come back as the economy continues to be on the upswing  as has historically been the case .
  - Source on that  Very interesting idea .
- - I ll happily buy you a Sheffield Wednesday one to add to your collection .
  - Unsure if you re serious  but I m not one to deny a gift .
- - With all the checkpoint sharing and all the exploits  Templar  Atheon  Crota ... Etc . I would nt be surprised but more disappointed
  - Yeah  was a bit of a mix of both  I suppose .
- - Especially since theres no crafting times on consoles .

- - Sounds like you need to spend more time here ...
  - I agree  many things have been neglected over the last few years .
- - First  happy birthday  Second  what is Hershey whipped cake and why is nt it already magically in my house  waiting for me to enjoy  
  - haha walmart cake with hersheys chocolate whipped cream frosting

- - Hey buddy how bout a NSFW tag  And why were you searching mermaid porn 
  - You re not wrong  i meant he tags exist for a reason . At the same time though he clearly said what it was going to be .
- - If he were to be transferred what would the fee be 
  - w do you even gauge the worth of the best player in the world  Just interests me . Surely he is priceless .
- - Are all you guys serious about thinking this is normal parenting  This is not parenting  this is how a child treats other children . Also  what s melk 
  - There are people on this thread acting like you are a pussy for thinking this is nt normal parenting . Makes you really wonder how the majority of people are raised .
- - If only . Life would be so much better without them
  - yeah . good feelings make you feel alive but I do nt know if they re worth also having to experience bad feelings .
- - I would nt explain my plan while orchestrating some elaborate death for the hero . I d just shoot him in the head a few times and move on .
  - Actually  throw him into a shredder for good measure .
- - Rubber bands are the worst method of castration . You re causing those animals to suffer prolonged and unnecessary pain . I would always cut . It s fast and clean .
  - Banding is standard  for better or for worse .

  - The effects of the god spells are far outclassed by the DPS of anything else .

  - Not with that username  you wo nt 
- - Well  at least you re open about it . I wish sex was nt considered taboo as much as it is .
  - You can hardly say sex is considered a taboo .
  - My definition of taboo might incorrect then . I m thinking of it being something people try not to talk about or acknowledge that it happens .
  - They act as if its shameful and not something that most everyone wants to partake in .
- - Yeah  but they re rich in vitamin vodka so it balances out . Which implies vodka is pretty much like bottled sunshine .
  - Can confirm . Source . vodka makes me happy  but too much makes me ache all over for days .
- - This was the best movie I ve watched this week  and hands down the best horror movie I ve seen this past year .

  - Move a trash can near the door . edit . Please .
- - It s so shocking that there are still people in the First World that do nt know how sex works and how babies are made .

- - Yup would be great for my doumbia and ibarbo to thrash someone and they decide to rematch and i press no LoL .
  - There s a special place in hell for people like you .

  - I d rather burn to death . It seems so much faster .

  - I ve seen him compared to Lavonte David .
- - How could hustler not make a good movie with that cast  They even threw random porn into the edit  It just does nt make sense 
  - Lesbian sex on top of a corpse ai nt exactly a mainstream kink unfortunately . And McDowell fisting a guy apparently does nt work as well .

  - Pretty sure they will  T-Mobile carries most lg phones
- - No . Do nt sign your messages to vendors .
  - I sign my messages ... anything wrong with that  They got my messages perfectly fine

  - Me  my friends and family all voted yes to leave I hate being part of the union 
- - The question that matters is . Why the fuck are there TWO GTAV subs 
  - Because one s filled with assholes  and one is independent from most of that .

  - I d rank it right up there with a shoe box full of cum
- - Lots of Kill La Kill lately . I m not saying I disapprove though .
  - Its an awesome show . And I think Monty said he based some of rwby off it a bit .

  - God the panty shots would be off the charts if he did
  - I m pretty sure there would be nothing BUT panties . not that I have a problem with that ...
  - Thankfully the boob ratio is pretty controlled . Same here ...
- - Why are you collecting it if its separately metered  Tell them to call the util company and open an account and let them deal with it .
  - I live in one of the units and the electricity and water are in my name .

  - That s too bad  but thanks for confirming . Good to know it s not a bug or just my account .
- - I do it sometimes  only thing i do nt like is one is never enough . too small .
  - For me its the perfect amount for a solo toke .
- - Tolerance - something most people  regardless of faith or lack thereof  understand the concept of .
  - Now if only we can get them to embrace it too ...
- - Or they re just doing something wrong . I ve turned around many players from bottom ranking to solid dps
  - You have a great deal more patience than I . Good for you .
- - wow that sounds amazing . I have a little bit of experience fisting . Most women ca nt handle it . But the ones that can  really enjoy feeling so full
  - I loved it  I came so quickly . I made him fist me two more times that day haha .

  - Aside from Dyou Know What I Mean . That song gives me shivers .
- - Knowing that no matter how much you love someone  you ca nt make them love you .
  - Also  realizing that loving someone may never be enough
- - I think they did the right thing . The probably cant do anything until he goes onto the property .
  - spot on . it s creepy but there s nothing illegal about sitting on a public road outside someones house .
- - LOL . That cracks me up . I ca nt imagine anything leading to divorce quicker than a struggling beta trying to buy favor from his unsatisfied wife with a backrub .
  - More then likely she ll recoil at his touch
- - I m sure you d make a great cashier at McDonalds if you wanted to give up your current life and pursue that instead .
  - haha ... thats nice  I m storing that for later use
- - And your form  maybe he is squatting not evenly with his whole leg . Using the Hamstrings  Gluteus and quads properly .

  - Yeah ... after this is over  which I hope it s over in less than a month  Im never having a full simulated war again ...
  - Not even simulated really  just outright ridiculous
  - Meh  I never really wanted this war to happen anyway  so I were kinda forced into it ...
- - Well  this is nt me  but I know a guy with a narrow urethra .
  - So much for his fetish up shoving pens up it
- - My advice for you would be to watch your back . The Lannisters are dangerous people .
  - This sounds like a debt to be repaid and the Lannisters always repay their debts .
- - I m no expert by any stretch of the word but it may have something to do with being filled up 
  - The box in the top right corner shows how much space is used  and when it was measured first it actually had less free space than now .

  - We re not sure if he got it from us or vise versa . P

- - I love this would do  but the tattoo is a turnoff .
  - They both need to be covered  tattoo can be redone . The only fix for the face is a bag .

  - Just posting a pic of my new shoes man
- - I feel like an idiot  but can someone explain this to me 
  - Sometimes you worry about stuff which will never happen at all . So you waste time for nothing  and not just time  but really bad time .
- - Why ca nt this just stop . Bringing it up every day just adds insult to injury
  - These were missed calls by the refs that would ve hurt Detroit .
- - I think JJ s gon na get buried .
  - I m still waiting for him to be pushed
- - A bit of bondo  sandpaper and paint . Blend it in a bit more  It is ARCA after all . I doubt the inspections will be too picky .
