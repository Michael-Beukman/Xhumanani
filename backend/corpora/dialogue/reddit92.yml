  - Fair point . Why is it wrong though 
- - I do nt think this went how they planned .
  - Yeah they have nt even responded in a good while . Hopefully they are already gone and we made Squids job a little easier
- - Later ... this week ... sounds like ... XUR IS GOING TO SELL GJALLARHORN 
  - I hope ... I have nearly every exotic ... and that thing evades me .
- - I guess he was tired of losing then
  - Even more than losing  I would get sick and tired of being thrown under the bus every single game .
- - I feel like Jacoby does nt really do anything .
  - Sometimes that is what you need . He is subtle . I love him
- - Why would such a sign even exist 
  - I suppose that it s truly the sign makers that get it
- - To the person who likes Liverpool . You suck just like your team
  - Do nt do this to me right now . First Gerrard now this .
- - I thought that was a bone thugs and harmony cover .
  - Wake up  Its the first of the month .
- - Does anybody know how they get the number for total strikes landed  Is it an estimate or is it the exact number 
  - They try to be exact  but there is always human error .
- - ITT . Repost of every comment in the above thread
  - ITT . Repost of every comment in the above thread
- - would a person living in rural wisconsin need to condition his RWs more often than one living in san fran 
  - That really depends on frequency of wear and condition exposure
- - I could watch myself shower . That would be awesome .
  - I like where your head s at .
- - I think they re merely pointing out that he is a superstar over there
  - leave it to a baseball fan to take something like that literally and then bust out the stats
  - That would be correct . Those stats are also useless without taking a lot of other things into account .
  - Yah  I mean it s not like they go into calculating WAR and stuff ...
- - Just proves there are idiots everywhere . People there regularly call for a Kessel trade .
  - Ugh those people give me headaches . That sub used to be relatively sane until this season  lately it s like it s been invaded by facebook fans .
- - Does this have anything to do with the Velvet poem from earlier 
  - No . Also  I had my ideas first .
- - I do nt like little or Mexican  wan na date 
  - Sure  random internet stranger  Sounds like a great idea 
- - Great point . My advice is simple - do nt like it  Buy products from other brand or create your own product line .
  - This argument works for machines that run Windows . Not so much for those that run OS X  especially laptops .
- - That s the stupidest reasoning I ve ever heard .
  - Well it does downgrade the situation from rapey to pretentious
- - No need to apologize . I just want you to feel better . . c
  - im never gon na feel better . sorry . im just wasting your time .
- - I mean if what she said was real
  - Well yeah ... that would suck way more .
- - What s with the cuntish comments here  It s a nice story .
  - My go to rule for life is people are usually quite cuntish 
- - Look cage side in the background by the bud light pillar for his cornermen s reactions
  - Or the top right  some girl in a bikini stands up .
- - I do nt see him as the next vice captain  but I could really see Flanno become vice captain or maybe even captain one day .
  - Only six months left on his contract so we do nt even know he ll be here next year .
- - God committed mass genocide and killed everyone on the earth with floods . Why are we surprised about any religious symbol killing 
  - Because the story of the flood is fiction  many of the accounts of Muhammad s life are written down by multiple authors .
- - so they dont mess up and accidentally walk to the enemy . if you do A and left click you cant accidentally walk to them .
  - Oh ye when you want to aa vayne and she tumbles ... honestly i never though about this
- - Where did you find this little angled mini-usb connector  I would love to get one for my HHKB 
  - Amazon.com has a bunch  Look for the Motorola Right Angle Mini USB adapter and a few should pop up .

  - He s handled him pretty well so far
- - Is Deron Williams the highest paid bench player in NBA s history 
  - allan houston  agent zero  gin baker

  - Yeah thats what i was planning on doing . Trying to find deals on some chinos that fit me haha
- - Is that shower seat positioned such that you would be facing away from the view 
  - I d use it to put a foot up when shaving my legs  so no .
- - How do you turn a closet into a room  That s some wizardry .
  - Are you being snarky with me young whipper snapper 
- - there seem to be at least three or so clips of emergency services across the street every now and then
  - Ohh haha yeah the college town I live in is a little crazy sometimes
- - Interesting . Thanks for that . The way it has been described to me  I did nt think it was allowed . I guess you do learn something new everyday .
  - No problem  MMA scoring is definitely really unnecessarily confusing .
- - He acts like he would nt have done this any way  he just needed an excuse . He s not fooling any one .
  - Yeah it s a proper challenge that i made up
- - Happy New year dude  Have nt seen you guys in forever . Coming through NY anytime soon 
  - Moving back to Philly in March so most definitely 
- - How come old timey people just capitalized at random 
  - I do nt think it s random  as it seems to be just nouns  and thus very similar to German .
- - Is there a bloodline mod that is extremly rare  like echoing shrines in Domination or tormented thiefs in Torment  Or is it really that easy to complete the challenge 
  - Rarest one is probably Keeper of Trove but even then you ll see it several times before you even reach maps .
- - It s the only good alt coin and it s not normally pumped and dumped
  - I ll pump it when it s a sidechain .
- - He is an ass who will always redefine terms rather than admitting mistake . Just down vote and move on . These types are nt worth the time .
  - He s long since completely and totally jumped the shark .
- - Also it s surprisingly difficult to adjust to playing a paper card game after so long . I am even having trouble shuffling my deck without damaging my sleeves lmao
  - Which method are you using  If you re having the issue of sleeves getting caught in other sleeves  try shuffling them together from the sides .
- - JET TURBINES AND JET TURBINES AND JET TURBINES AND JET TURBINES AND JET TURBINES AND you get the picture ...
  - but what comes after the fifth JET TURBINES  I ll never know 
- - I had some school spirit in high school . Never for college .
  - I m the opposite . I chose my college  not my high schools . I went to two and neither were particularly interesting .
- - Well  it suggests the people at UGC can easily misuse their power  for one ...
  - Anyone who s played ugc knows their admins are pretty terrible
- - I d wear the shit out of these .
  - You took the words right out of my mouth ... And I m a guy
- - If you lose power mid update you could brick your motherboard . Improved system performance sure is tempting though .
  - It s probably only in very specific situations .
- - Ass to mouth is of you put your dick in her ass then into her mouth . Not eating her ass
  - If you scroll down and read one more of my comments  i know this .
- - In the most optimistic way possible  I m expecting us to be blown out .
  - Ehhhh ... a road game this late at night  I doubt it .
- - I d kill to have a Guitar Center nearby .
  - depending on who s staffed in it  i would agree .
- - Include that in your will  please .
  - I think several future generations of my family with need this in their will
  - meanwhile  I can take millions out on the worth of the gems and create a long life machine . Hell i d even build a socket for your skull too 
  - Glad my skull will be honoured like that
- - Hey Sportsnet  you know when a good time for interviews is  Intermission .
  - Great to hear from hammer  but jeez ...
- - Yeah when I see someone barely touch their crotch I think they re into necrophilia too
  - If you ignore the fact that the touch is in front of a clearly tortured and very dead body  then I would call it just a touch too .
- - Norway also has less of a deficit problem than the US  and a better environmental record ... wonder how that happened ...
  - Environmental record  We export oil and gas .
- - Thought this thread was going to be about Emma Frost ...
  - I just thought it was going to be a general discussion about the quality of heroes boobs .
- - Context is nice here imo  helps you see what he was expressing
  - Yeah I think so too  but I guess some people think it s just a bit rediculous .
- - Random  but is this in Chicago 
  - Looks like certain lines in nyc . Not sure if they have the same looking trains in Chicago .
- - I m laughing so fucking hard I m crying
  - I kinda felt bad for the balance beam there . Any closer to center and it might ve cracked .
- - That s true  I m expecting that too . It s just that I would think they d change the poll too of they release their LoL team .
  - well it would be a vote of the year  and the LoL team was present all year . i see no reason for them not to be there 
- - You will very  very likely have to buy a licence for each platform . I m genuinely surprised anyone thinks different .
  - But why  What makes people think this 
- - holy shit dude you re blowing my mind
  - hey maybe ill blow you re penis 
- - Try getting the SJWs to get this .
  - They re too busy defending the Paris massacre as something the West deserves .
- - May I help you to fix this if it s not that complicated 
  - I mean montage is messy  not portrait ingame  its pretty smooth .
- - Stumbling blocks are needed  I think . At least if we re going to tell a story . A story without conflict is ... well  something else .
  - A story without conflict is not a story  it is fluff .
- - I have fucking hair on my toes .
  - I do too  you can stop bragging about it now  Mr. fancy toe hair ...
- - ARE YOU THIS IS OBVIOUS AS GUCK LIKE WHAT THE FUCK
  - art pls pry your lips off the bottle
- - GEORGE BUSH DOES NT CARE ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE
  - He was probably right about that one .
- - The last Detroit playoff win is older than me ... fuuuuuuck .
  - I was nt even one year old .
- - Im having some trouble downloading them . It says in line to download then nothing happens 
  - And you are nt currently downloading anything else  Usually it says that when you are currently downloading another milk VR video .
- - How much does full health insurance cost a month 
  - Less than that one guy s cell phone bill .
- - You ca nt  plain and simple .
  - I do nt buy that nothing can be done . There is always something that will work better than what we have now . We just have to find it .
  - Well  I guess it all depends on what you mean when you say soft target . Official government employees and buildings  Civilians 
  - Some targets are softer than others . This was not exactly an unprotected target but not a fortress either .
  - So far all I ve seen is the video of the guys gunning down that dude in the street .
  - I am in Paris itself . We get more coverage than you .
- - A single radio can host multiple Wifi networks .
  - actually one radio can either act as a client or a host  and when it is a host it can only broadcast one WiFi network
- - Good thing I do nt have yorick . D
  - I dont know why i bought him  im feeling to use a refund ticket lmao
- - In the privacy of her own home this would have been the correct solution  but she really should have considered everybody else as well .
  - No it would nt . She still spoke to the child  meaning she gave it attention . It s a parenting fail for everyone
- - People make a mess of it because they want to make sure they die . Pills do nt always work .
  - Oh I realized that they do nt always work
- - I had a Lego aircraft carrier exactly like that
  - I promise you it was not an actual Lego set  but a knockoff product like mega bloks or some such
- - Looks pretty good OP  It s really tough to do a period piece with a low budget  but looks like you re well on your way 
  - I have a love for period pieces like this . They re a lot of work  but worth it 
- - Even thought it s true  fuck sally . She is part of the problem as well .
  - Agreed  I started to read the article and clicked away as soon as the words Washington football club were typed .
- - Fusion rifles are just long ranged shotguns .
  - That actually need to be aimed  and can be dodged easily by strafing ...
- - What keeps the pins from coming loose 
  - Which pins  The ones with the screw caps 
  - The seer pins ... How do they stay in without the hammer spring in the little notch 
  - It s a drop-in FCG . The pins on this one are held in by the screw caps you see  which are on each side  most likely .
  - Ok  just little screws in place of the pins . Makes sense now . Thanks .
  - Or pins with threaded holes in the ends  and screws that screw into those to lock them in place .
- - That looks like a beautiful and valuable piece of skilled craftsmanship . I m surprised the owners of the property did nt remove it for a quick buck .
  - That could be removed in a day . Getting a scissor boom in there might be hard .
- - I did a few stretches and the sharp pains subsided  but it s still there . Had to head outside and build a bed frame .
  - Good to hear it s feeling a bit better . Hopefully you ll be good by tomorrow .
- - Wow  they showed blitz and no adjustments whatsoever .
  - he either is nt good enough to know to audible ... or he is nt allowed to audible . Not good either way .
- - If its red it s PIE . If it s brown it s PIH . Treatment is the same for both .
  - Ohhhh  okay . Thanks for clearing it up 
- - My mum does this  does nt give me any time to hide anything that she might have a problem with  like the empty bottles of alcohol .
  - I think thats exactly why she comes in right away as she knocks
- - Why not just leave the lid shut but not locked 
  - I do nt always shut it all the way  leaving a gap on the side . Shutting it fully will seal the lid  as it s quite tight .
- - is there anywhere i can test out fakes 
  - What you mean  A scanner  as I could probably embed one .
  - what  I m just trying to review fake ids
  - Why are you posting here then  can you read 
- - Now I can pirate a car  fuck yea  . D
  - You ca nt really pirate it because the design is open source . . D
- - I do nt have any CC  sorry  but I just want to say I love your face 
  - Awww thanks  That s so sweet  I love everything except my actual skin  obviously .
- - Hi and welcome glad your here  Fav sports teams 
  - I m a New York Giants  Yankees  and Boston Bruins fan ... so it s kind of a rough time for me haha
- - Google is nt always right either . They throw stuff at a wall to see if it sticks .
  - Which is certainly a much better approach than not throwing stuff at a wall and simply debating whether it ll stick or not .
- - The smallest case I know of is the evga hadron air
  - Yeah no wasted space in that thing  was tempted to use it in my next build but I think I ll stick with the prodigy m
- - Have you let your Vita s battery drain completely multiple times to the point where it shuts off 
  - Would that be a good thing or a bad thing 
- - I like the look of white  you made a good choice
  - Thanks  Yeah I think it looks really nice with the red interior .
- - You umm  seem to have posted the same thing twice .
  - I seem to have done that yes . i apologize for that
- - Put a spoiler warning bro . I ve seen it but shit .
  - Yeah  but if you should know that reading anything other than the direct comments on this thread is risky .
- - Coffee Tree Roasters in East Liberty  Shadyside  or Squirrel Hill .
  - Coffee Tree Roasters  Sounds like my kinda place . Thank you for suggesting 
- - Would nt it turn more quickly when the billet is closer 
  - Yes  that s exactly what it says .
- - Do nt be sorry . People whose eyes are open to the obvious already feel sorry for you . Enjoy your ignorance while you re still young 
  - Is this the start of the conspiratard brigade  I ca nt wait 
- - There are so many layers to this picture .
  - Like an onion . That make me an ogre 
- - Totally  speeding saved this young woman s life .
  - I m glad I m not the only one who saw it like that
- - Try to play music full time  robots ca nt do that 
  - There have been many advances in algorithmic composition
- - Yoshi  He s YOSHI . How ca nt you like him 
  - Yoshi is the best amiibo due to him having the most functionality out of all of them . I feel that s a huge  distinct detail apart from the others .
- - Behind you fully  but I must repeat IANAL is pretty common . Probably a good chunk of the reason being its silliness
  - I do nt care how common it is  it is hugely distracting from any argument . Funny as hell  but distracting .
- - Took me a while to figure out the base was in the lower right corner and not the lower left
  - The guy who took the photo could ve just walked to the side ...
- - Old Dan and Little Ann from Where the Red Fern Grows .
  - This is my second saddest . Where the Red Fern Grows was my favorite book for years . That scene still gets me .
- - The lighting looks really nice in most of these . That sea water  though  ugh .
  - i m using different water mods in some shots so I do nt know which you mean look bad .
- - Well that is an infuriatingly useful revelation .
  - This gracefully articulates my first impression . Well done .
- - At least they re in field goal range guys 
  - Well  FGs are nt a sure thing  now are they 
  - I thought I was safe in this thread
  - All in fun  man . All in fun .
  - Lol . Please beat Bama . You re my only hope .
  - You have no idea how nervous I am  man . Just straight BGs right now .
- - did I just watch Johnny English in German  
  - if anything i think it adds to the atmosphere
- - They are nt your friends  so do nt stick around . Get out asap .
  - Lease ends end of July  and I m not going to break the lease . Too expensive and complicated .
- - What we have is economic empire expansion  and hegemony of the corporation  not world government .
  - This is why I think that we need one .
- - Haha and seeing how interactive the destiny community is it would be a blast to have such a puzzling character thrown in
  - It would be epic . So much potential in this game that is nt being used 
- - do nt use a belt till heavy ass weights . same with deadlifts .
  - When is it heavy  I m nearing three hundred on squat and over on dl . Should I be wearing a belt for safety 
- - Oh okay thanks for clearing that up .
  - In online mode there s one that spawns at the airport
- - You did nt find a flat yet  did you 
  - No  I m not coming to Romania until March .
- - Ok  thanks for informing me OP  The future suicidal me will remember that .
  - On a serious note ... good  because it help me .
- - Sadly  I m not even joking . he did it because he despised his face . There is self-hatred lurking beneath the skin of all of these extreme body modifications .
  - At least he chose this over mass murder . Unless that s next .
- - Clearly Canadian ... miss that drink so much
  - There is currently a project  ala Kickstarter  to bring it back . Do a quick google search and order a case
- - I really like this deal if we shop Rosario . Please ... just trade him .
  - They wo nt . They ll ask the sky for him  and then just DFA and let him walk to another team .
- - Higby said recon drones are no longer infil unique  and will be consumables for all classes .
  - mm Recon drones . It s like a motion spotter but has a different animation . Real game changer there .
- - Stronghold is one of the best looking sets ever . It also had some fairly strong cards .
  - The art from Tempest - Urza s Destiny was my favorite
- - What s with the goon in the last pic 
  - That s just my best friend from High School .
- - Dude  you ca nt cite wikipedia anymore . You got ta be smart about that shit .
  - You could never cite Wikipedia . That s why you cite Wikipedia s citations .
- - Do you have insurance on the car  Do you have a receipt  If you do nt have both  you probably have a mess .
  - Yes - I have insurance on the car . I got insurance back in September when I took the car . What kind of receipt do you mean 
- - could you add me and tell me my pokemons 
  - Added you  I ll tell you what your are  can you tell me
- - Not on the inside . The date code is underneath the head -- letter on the left  number on the right just under the Gillette diamond .
  - Thanks  It was very faded so I missed it .
- - I ve been playing kolento s demonlock . I think it s quite good .
  - Interesting  what ranks have you been playing it at  Also  if you can post the decklist that would be awesome .
- - Did you lie about your gender identity to get the prescription 
  - I said something like I want to a girl .
- - Which is better  Whats in the movie that is not in the book or vice versa  Tnx
  - In the book but not the movie . Beorn got cut a lot from the movie and Fili loving that elf was so stupid .
- - What s so special about it  What s the difference between getting a CC and getting it from Amazon or whatever 
  - They have a store  but they re not a competitor to Amazon . They do the work to restore films with high-quality transfers  features  essays  and packaging .
- - It is kind of creepy to think of obituaries in waiting . So sad .
  - Some actors had theirs published on accident . That s got to be awkward .
- - Whaaaaaat  That was sooo close  Wow . Good job Ohio  We ll see you in the Championship Game 
  - I am terrified of you . But I was of Bama too  so idk 
- - Why do nt you reveal more info about where she works 
  - Frankly I do nt know if she d be cool with revealing too much info . I can answer what I can through PM though .
- - I mean  you probably should nt publish anti-Islamic cartoons because it s insensitive  but of course  freedom of speech outweighs that so its their right .
  - Considering how Fox likes to slant things  that s probably what the President meant .
- - Stealing garden trolls and putting them in other peoples gardens .
  - PLOT TWIST . You re going to steal garden trolls and put them in other peoples gardens whom you stole garden trolls from . RADICAL .
- - wait wait wait ... i think you are mistaken . higher resistance means lower amperage . lower amperage means less wattage . cheaper  but less efficient .
  - Higher resistance actually means more voltage drop . Whether or not that translates into lower amperage depends entirely on the characteristics of the load .
- - I think it s fair to say that we are in the presence of a massive penis .
  - Mine or yours cause the rest of the people here all have twats
- - Damn . That s a lot of progression for a whole year . Nice work 
  - Thanks . Yeah I draw a lot . I just scrap most of my drawings and never post em .
- - I should have specified  PC version has no multiplayer .
  - ah  and yes still not on PC .
- - And who made up that rule exactly  One person says something and everyone else repeat it like parrots as if it s gospel .
  - It s not a rule  just a saying that most likely you would always need something more complex than what you re trying to understand .
- - What would you have them do differently 
  - Oh I do nt know  maybe make a crockpot that does nt explode when you use it .
- - We love you too . Probably . If you re nice .
  - He or she is Australian . Odds are very high .
- - Make a code gate heavy shell game deck .
  - Take that  Kit  My ICE is already all Code gates 
- - Nonsense  Comrade Deadbones leads the district .
  - With the help of lord Willakers  he is tricking him to then destroy nether ward too 
- - hey man  for career longevity  ill take it
  - Exactly  he knows the plays over  he s gon na live to see another down and keep himself fresh . It s smart .
- - Photobucket man  What s your MySpace  I ll link it on my livejournal
  - Oh man  thank you for that .
- - That could of been due to a fake SD card .
  - Yeah I think so . It recognised the card and everything  but it just did nt work proper . It was a dodgy buy anyway so you re probably right
- - I have an egg matching your TSV . Can you hatch it for me 
  - I ll be free in a few hours .
  - Could you wait a few minutes  I m about to do a trade with someone .
  - Yeah sure . I m in no rush just comment when you re ready .
- - there are many reasons if you ca nt see them then they are nt worth pointing out
  - Hmm  you do nt like this track or something  Let s talk it out .
- - I thought girls went to the bathroom in odd numbers because they literally ca nt even .
  - Nonono  that was for White grills .
- - yes  let s just wait  muslims exterminate Europeans this will be so much better
  - How do you imagine that could happen  Like  in  practical terms 
- - Freedom . Most Scandinavian countries have far more lax laws than us .
  - Depends on where in Scandinavia  Sweden now has several Shariah Law zones .
- - Such Dogecar  Wow  Thank you 
  - Oh the pleasure is all mine good sir  congratulations on one year of great writing 
- - Firefighters protect us from actual threats to Australians .
  - The floods in Queensland were nt a threat then  The military deployed then .
- - I read your username as Sweet Christie haha . I think I miss the glory days too much
  - Hahaha  when Christie filled in for Bobby Jackson on the Kings pre-game live  it made me miss it even more
- - Keyboard buttons affect systemwide audio level  and they always have .
  - They do nt though for some reason .
- - Believing that everyone is just like you does nt make it true .
  - It s less believing and more matter-of-fact . Just look at half the other comments .
- - I think it s a proven fact that kids taste food different than adults  making them pickier eaters  specially with more bitter foods .
  - Which is why they do nt like some vegetables .
- - So people will start working on February theme before they know the winner for the January contest 
  - The final final theme will be revealed from the pool of user suggested themes on the first of the month .
- - you lucky bastard  i d kill a man for that
  - The Crystal Shard  A lot of people kill people for that .
- - So you re saying ... DMG best  . P
  - That s exactly what he s saying .

  - Call the show if you re also hearing voices .
- - I know all of those  chill .

- - I quite enjoy the main strip of Hamilton . Only been out there twice and enjoyed myself both times  Also did nt catch anything .
  - yeah you re lucky you did nt catch chlamydia just going to a bar ... 
- - Couldnt you check in the store under purchases 
  - I did the same as OP . It s not there for me .
- - That s probably one of my worst fears .
  - Mine too  A confined space  and the ceiling is coming down 
- - Hoping for Rory s title shot to be in Toronto later in the year
  - They are really alienating and pissing off Canadians .
- - Vice versa If they had clay for ghosts I do nt think they would of had as much success
  - Yeah  that s what I mea nt but I messed up what I wanted to say .
- - Looks nice . What part of the Middle East  Is that goat cheese in there 
  - It s eggs . Tomato base  crack in raw eggs  bake to cook the eggs and warm the sauce .
  - So do people in the Middle East actually eat this with their hands  It d seem difficult
  - I think they would use pita bread  I m not sure .
- - How many Australian nationals are fighting with ISIS  Could nt it be useful for the intelligence services to see who their contacts are 
  - Ting ting ting  we have a winner .
- - Why is this not a picture of Africa 
  - If we all came from Africa originally  how come there s still an Africa 
- - That is up to you . If the more detail includes an answer to the second question  I d appreciate it .
  - Like if I did it would be a massive block of rage text and calling a few people out
- - I ve never seen a dog turn down food before . I m astonished .
  - If it had been a Labrador he would have inhaled it through his nostril even if he disliked it . Akitas seem to have more self control . . D
- - You should nt have to buy something in order to clean something you just bought .
  - alcohol will take it off . are you saying cups should be pre filled 
- - You still have nt finished that steak 
  - last bite ... im a slow eater .
- - they look like shit . go buy a licensed fan version from costco and remove the extra stripe . someone here did that and it looks closer to legit than these will
  - they look fine to me and im just curious since the rest of the site has some decent stuff .
- - A Razer case  what s next  a keyboard by Noctua
  - It s a Razer edition NZXT case .
- - Check out the Bellatrix Female Warriors  a women s promotion run by Paige s mum . The only thing I could think of in Norwich .
  - Thanks I knew her family were all involved in the business but did nt know her mum ran a promotion . Will check it out 
- - I would try calling Hop City Krog Street Market . I picked some up there a week or so ago .
  - Did nt see any when I was there Saturday
- - Thanks  I m on mobile right now so I did nt see it .
  - Get BaconReader it shows flair it s actually what I m in right now .
- - It d be awesome for a Liverpool fan in LA
  - Not really . I ca nt see the negative of a legend leaving my club being outweighed by the positive of getting to see him play for a local team ...
- - Was expecting trouble from Renekton but guess not  for Riven ofcourse .
  - Renekton is only really an issue for the first few levels
- - When Animals Dream is the only one of those trailers that actually made me interested in seeing it .
  - Wer is worth a watch  IMO . Agreed that When Animals Dream was the best looking of the lot though .
  - I dunno  the puberty allegory is pretty tired .
  - Yes  but I m starved enough for werewolf movies that I ll still give it a chance .
- - The two different kinds are mad at each other and that is the major problem .
  - Well clearly if they are mad at each other s its cause they see the faults on each other
- - Much like fishes  vaginas only smell bad if they are bad or dirty
  - Or if their ph balance is off .

- - You sound like a retard so you are most likely going to get addicted and in a very bad way . Have fun .
  - Obvious troll is obvious . Play nice or go somewhere else .
- - Thinning of the herd  as they say .
  - That herd s so thin it s transparent now .
- - Your victim mentality is symptomatic of deep psychological issues . Please seek help before you hurt yourself or others .
  - Harsh  but funny It was in jest right 
- - You telling me my man does nt pee or poop 
  - No . He very hard worker . Uses everything up .
- - What about the fact that the burial took place at midnight according to Jay 
  - The cell phone evidence does nt support that story .

  - Glad to oblige  Sewing wisdom for the busty is best shared so it can grow .
- - Maybe keep it short on the sides and do a sexy  floppy thing on top  Your hair is amazing 
  - I was thinking of doing a cut like that once the top gets long enough . Thank you 
- - Your logic is sound  but why the insults  OP just asked a simple question .
  - no insults were thrown . sorry if i came off that way  no intentions of that on my part . it was an example that applies to all of us
- - He commented on this at the beginning of today s show and agreed that the timing was horrendous and that he should nt have brought it up .

- - Dispensaries are useless until IL approves the cultivation centers . Plenty of dispensaries have been approved  that s not the issue .
  - All I know is what I read in the window .
- - I would nt say that . It was an easy mistake to make given the thread s context .
  - Still should have read the whole comment . By the way  what was the last song you listened to  Trying to make a playlist .

  - He bought them from a local shoe store back in the day .

- - Not claiming I know what I m talking about but is it possible that the cleaner for fogged headlight lamps is a good bet here 
  - Some have had really good luck with that . I m just going with what I know .
- - Yep  that s jujitsu . The specific throw might also be in judo  too  but it does nt usually break your arm  so I do nt know .
  - Well to be honest  I do nt think he meant to break my arm but my flailing why being tossed around probably did nt help .
- - Your last one was Stoke mate  enough is enough
  - My last was Newcastle  actually  and that went rather well .
- - You should probably get him to do the test .
  - I would love to but he probably would nt sit through the whole thing . At least I would nt think he would .
- - I thought that its just searched by new and using various keywords for what they re protecting .
  - That s what I figure with anything like this . Whatever companies run these shill accounts have an automated script that scans various sites for keywords .
- - That really looked like a catch to me . Surprised they did nt review it .
  - It looked complete until they showed that final angle . It hit the ground at the end  but that s the only view that showed it .

- - FSU ca nt even retain any dignity at this point .
  - Well at least my lack of dignity is matched by my lack of sobriety right now  so I ve got that going for me  which is nice
- - Why is he wearing women s boots 
  - Apparently to be taller than his gf lol
- - Do nt worry guys . You ll get an update . Got yet another fabulous tale also .

  - It s so pleasantly surprising how patient people in this community are .
- - I have a new sga like term ; SCS . Simple Common Sense .
  - Yeah  I think that applies to my last statement .
  - it applies to all the recent SGAs ive seen .
  - Lol . Not sure about the other SGAs  but apparently people still need to see this one . I see it happen pretty often .

  - And in some tellings it s both because fuck continuity 
  - Hey  Continuity is one of the most useful mods 
- - Turns on Ferocious . Definitely not first pickable but I would probably run it in an aggressive Jeskai or Temur deck .
  - Looks like UG tempo filler at best  and will only see play in other decks if things have gone horribly wrong .
- - And all their food tastes like shit .
  - Calm down  KFC makes delicious chips . I ca nt disagree about the rest of them though .
- - do you think when one gets a tattoo it magically appears on the other one

  - Look in the Bible and you will have your answer . I do nt make the rules .
- - The balls on this guy . The massive massive balls . Zero fucks given .

- - You suck at loading guns . Or got lucky with a primer . Care to try again

  - i dunno but I saw a squirrel this one time he was going like this ...
