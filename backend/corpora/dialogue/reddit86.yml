- - So the drill bit or screwdriver slips and stabs your hand . It s a bandaid conspiracy .
  - I knew those bastards were up to something 
- - You might be making a lot of assumptions regarding the training of the individuals committing these acts . It sounds like you think the victims should just accept their fates .

  - The article was published today . And looking at the related posts it is nt listed .
  - I read it nearly a week ago on this sub ... maybe they changed part of it

  - I do nt know what those are but I laughed .
- - Head to the garden section then . Surely that d be a buffet for you 
  - Apparently bunnings do nt take well to me eating all the plants they re trying to sell . Having to pay for a whole plant section hurt my wallet .

  - I also thought it was just objectively funny .
- - Sorry this took so long  that is absolutely ok we need something here to get people to want to post here .
  - Cool . Should have another coming today then 
- - Still interested in working out a trade for SBK 
  - Yeah for sure . Can you link your list again 
- - Nintendo is decidedly NOT more popular in EU than NA . That is patently false .
  - Popular may have been a poor choice of words  let s go with present

  - Not that I remember . But it was almost a year ago . All I remember is it was insane
- - Finally . the legitimate use for a keylogger .
  - The program I used is actually an automation scripter  I had used it to help speed up some repetitive work tasks . I felt like that was pretty legitimate .
- - This is a good point . If the tattoo artist does not know Cyrillic the chances are just too high something is going to be screwed up in the result .
  - Probably not . As long as the artist can find a nice font  the tattoo will be made using a stencil .
- - It s shitty SO OFTEN too . Really makes me sad .
  - The fact that Bruins fans are down voted so heavily due to flair is sad .
- - I get hit by a green turtle at the end .

- - Yeah but this is tickling  the whole point is not to stop .
  - No means no  Except when tickling .
- - Does nt matter  clearly  if she ca nt see the connection then it simply does nt exist 
  - If she keeps up with the astronomically high blood sugar levels she wo nt be seeing much of anything ever again .
- - Anyone have the source video for this  I have to hear that guy s reaction .
  - OP is source . No video though it seems .
  - There has to be a video  there s a webcam of OP in the lower right corner . Maybe a Twitch streamer 
  - Not saying there is nt one  just that OP does nt seem to have posted one .

  - He would be a god . Do IT do IT do IT 
- - The manga is still running  Drawing to a close though .
  - at the rate kubo is going  bleach will never end
- - You d think that they would just have the band move down a row and you guys would be the first row above them
  - They might have intended for the trombones to have a row of empty space for slide movement but I guess that would still work .

  - yeah ... skinny lean women always look great in dresses ... they are sort of designed for them ...
- - I think they know what they meant .
  - Really  I do nt think anybody intentionally uses words that make their sentences incoherent .
- - this sub is so fucking gentrified right now you guys
  - I just realized you have the online personality of an IRL local comedian .
- - Pretty nice  but I d advise buying from multiple retailers .
  - Yeah you can usually get better prices that way . The country that OP is from may cause an issue though .
- - My girlfriend and I do nt want kids  but hearing things like this certainly make me tempted .
  - Just man up and play with toys yourself .
  - Or have a kid and then play with the toys and the kid .
  - I ca nt wait to by my little guy some kinects . I was to old when they first came out .
