  - Oh a DIET coke you say  nice .
  - Come on now  It balances  right  I ate all that but the diet is counter acting 
- - And its not like he had all-pro potential . His potential is an explosive number two .
  - I disagree with this  especially at draft time last year . He was viewed as a sure thing and absolutely lit up college football .
- - They did nt knock over the night stand or throw any of the objects on top . The older we get  the harder it was .
  - I heard it all got a lot easier after my class .
  - Everyone hears that though . Eventually a peewee football team will be harder than the US military
  - By the time I retire I ll be telling everyone they shot the first guy off the bus as a warning to the rest of us .

- - what was the seating arrangement before this 
  - Left to right . Formal - Nade - Scump - Crimsix
- - i mean that many of the things you listed can not just be left alone completely  because most of them still require replanting
  - No  all of them can be fully automated . Villagers do the replanting .
- - Or you just clear it once and actually look in it instead of being an asshole and assuming it s empty . Bullets are pretty hard to overlook .
  - That s where the complacency is an issue  numb nuts .
- - I have a diddy Kong amiibo interested in heart gold . Would be open to negotiations
  - sorry but I do nt think one amiibo is worth it .
- - We did nt lose  just ran out of time
  - Sounds like the tagline for an action movie .
- - Mockery from you  Not even on your best day  child .

  - You do nt know anything about me . You re just an angry little man whinging .
  - Jim Murphy is a non-entity . You are unionist scum . x

  - What did it say I did nt get a chance to read it .
- - Guy in the UK . I find girls with American accents very attractive  especially from the South .
  - My Brit friends make relentless fun of mine .
- - The city of Houston gives into Bud Adams stadium demands ...

  - Yes we know  we re sending less than half  most are staying in your country . Thank you for your efforts in the war .
- - Uninformed and religious yes but grounded in reality at least
  - How so  ... reality is arguably subjective ...
- - Nice but a little too dark at the bottom of the sword
  - I meant to do that  it looks nice ingame trust
- - Medusa arrows splitting into more arrows  Volvo pls
  - No  just make the arrows really big  that way it cleaves everyone .
- - The only auto trans i would avoid is the Dodge .
  - I second this . Unless your going to build the tranny then stay away from them .
- - do other things work fine in the same usb port  I had this happen once and the usb port had shorted  killing the mouse
  - that sounds like a probable cause  nothing works in that usb port anymore .
- - I think this describes most musicians  or at least guitarists  cause I find it eerily similar to my life .
  - Or maybe we re just a congregation of hopeless people who need to do something with our lives .
- - Im a pretty nice person so i dont think me being an asshole will be an issue . Where did you visit in central Europe 
  - Germany  Czech Republic  and Austria . All great places .
- - I d call in sick than attend one of these sessions .
  - Cant they told us that is is more important than regular school so the only way we wont be penalized is if we have a doctors note
  - If someone is protesting in a first-world country  that person is probably an idiot . Just a general rule of thumb .
  - Idk its not protesting its just idk we re marching to this think called the shed where we watch more presentations
- - I love it . Nice people  too . It s great 
  - It ll have to be on the bucket list

  - Would you believe I ve been sitting on this for months 
- - Somehow this was the default recording DirecTV recorded for me . No bueno man  no bueno .
  - Must have been a lower channel number .
- - Was it with Zeller because they called a foul if you breathed on him when he was there as a sophomore
  - Yeah it was . he was always flailing his arms after any contact looking for a foul
- - I wish I could find BF on PC  literally impossible .
  - Yeah it s very easy . Just download it on steam .
- - Nutella  I m not sure why  but I ca nt stand the stuff 
  - I went through a phase in undergrad where I ate it all the time  now I can barely smell it without feeling sick .
- - So why do nt you work for Bungie yet  If they had any sense they would buy that image from you and pay you to make more . Excellent idea 
  - Haha working for Bungie on Destiny would be my dream job . I would sell my soul to Xur for it .
- - Unfortunately I think we loaded him into a cannon and shot him into the sun .
  - Good  I was fearing for his ankles for a second  there .
- - Cmon USPS . We have fake Internet points to get
  - when can rep sites get UA real points
- - Beastie Boys went from hardcore punk to hip hop .
  - Do nt forget the instrumental funk albums .
- - You should get those teeth looked at .
  - That s why I posted it . Everybody can see them .

  - I know . I m good at sarcasm . This is nt a new picture and the sweet fella is now deceased .
- - thanks for the game  I hope your game becomes even bigger this year 
  - Thank you so much  We try our hardest 
- - I do nt think you realize how close your dog is to death in that photo
  - Yeah  this is honestly one of those situations where this person deserves to be judged for taking a picture .
- - Did you check his inventory prior to buying it 
  - Yeah  I did . What should I do 
- - definitely  not even a discussion . it was typical murray walker too to defend hill for the rest of the broadcast
  - Murray Walker always loved Hill but you need to be fair . he always defended all drivers even Schumacher . You make look like Murray is trashing anyone who oppose Hill
- - Well  are nt you a cunt 
  - they hate us  cuz they ai nt us .
- - Would it be possible to do for cheaper then normal internet 
  - Not very likely  unless you made a massive network - an ISP of your own - and resold access .
- - He referenced the Blue Beatle from DC comics .
  - That s a Beetle  not a Beatle .
- - i feel like there are alot of how too home remedies so you dont need to go to a doctor or walkin clinics
  - Yes  but what about the actual workers  How does it affect them 
  - in the long run it could put them out of a job . who would need them 
  - A lot of people would . There s always emergencies ; people are nt going to find a home remedy for appendicitis
- - It s a very interesting point about decolonization . I suggest you read Frantz Fanon  he had very interesting insight on this .
  - I would love to read about it which one of his works though 
- - I watched a small series ages ago . Is the manga still going 
  - Yep  for years now actually . The Anime does nt even cover the entirety of the beginning of the manga  so I d really recommend reading it .
- - Are you sure Up was the only thing on the list  Maybe they just wanted to avoid an awkward conversation .
  - I saw the letter . It just said Up
- - PICTURE UPSIDE DOWN ALSO . SAME CARD IN THE PICTURE MULTIPLE TIMES
  - Yeah im pretty sure he knows its upside-down ...
- - You re purposely misinterpreting what I said . Classic logical fallacies ... nice try though
  - I quoted exactly what you said and applied the logic similarly . Your double standard is a logical fallacy . Nice try  though .
- - I think there should be one for ADC s only . Would probably be too strong on Fighters and Assassins .
  - ADC would only very rarely buy it . They need their gold and slots for more offensive stats .
- - Hey Jay  Interested in a mg banshee norn

  - Haha . Sometimes things are hidden right in the open 
  - I swear I ve tried this before at some point and it did nt work lol never though of trying it again
- - Tea party and SJW  pretty much the same thing right 
  - Colin and daemon have joked about how crazy liberal San Fran is .
- - You re on top of your game .
  - Now that you ve pinpointed the smell all you got ta do is wash it off .
- - You do nt get what he s sayin  It made sense .
  - Is it still English  I ca nt tell
- - What ... how did Huke kill them both lol 
  - I was so confused when the round ended .
- - Just writing a line in a Subscriber Agreement does nt trump the law .
  - It does if you agree to it .
- - At least I laugh  but it sounds like a troll for me ...
  - I hope this is a troll  because this story is just pathetic .
- - I think spring training is going to be huge for Timmy this year
  - It s always an adventure  but a bad spring never stopped him or Zito from starting .
- - He s killed more Europeans than ISIS ...
  - They should hire him as a medic .
- - Make a truckload of money through death defying stunts
  - But is one hundred days enough to set that all up 
  - you get famous pretty quick when you jump off the empire state building into a kiddy pool and live .
  - Could you deal with the pain though 
- - No team that played today is going to win a super bowl .
  - Ravens beat pats and upset everyone for another SB win
- - Looks great  be sure to bevel some of those edges too 
  - thanks  i have a lot of work on the model
- - So the dress is like a food back-up 
  - Meh  I think it s more them trying to project that they re comfortable with the fact that they choose to be fat maybee 
- - Any suggestions on who to use instead of zelnite 
  - replace zelnite only on vargas GGC . Use a unit with water buffing or a decent water unit .
- - Yup  still nothing meaningful in this comment . Just poop slinging . Pretty weak .
  - Ok facts are poop to you ... noted .
- - But regardless of him leaving or staying  he was gon na be champion 
  - Pretty sure if he did nt resign  Punk was either losing to Cena or Del Rio would have cashed in successfully .
- - so a wireless adapter would work just fine 
  - I m sure there are some out there that work just fine . You could also try powerline adapters .
- - League of Legends Why do I play this game 
  - I m glad I never started ... I stick to Mario haha
- - It would not surprise me at all that they got this story wrong .
  - The media down here has gotten EVERYTHING wrong this season . Probably another fake report .
- - Convert  kill or die . Those are our choices .
  - So says Resa Aslan with regards to Jihadists .
- - Loaned To Bordeaux . Suffered quite a few injuries there .
  - It is quite sad  he joined them for then getting a pretty bad injury . Overall this has not been his season so far .
- - It s easier to complain than to do something about it
  - if theyre so miserable one would think thats actually not the case
- - The NFL is bigger than the UFC probably ever will be man  get over it .
  - Good point . Good point . One can dream that one day the rest of the world will see but good point .
- - Get electric blue because if you fail hard enough  she wo nt ask again .
  - lol ... but she will kill me ...
- - He recently had begun treatment and was completely lucid  but due to lingering remnants of his condition  he would from time to time get trust issues .
  - I d still double check with his therapist  to see whether the test was liable to be good or bad for his condition .
- - I imagine they just had to ban whaling . It s kind of hard to get away with killing a blue whale and bringing it home without anyone noticing .
  - Not unless you had a couple slap chops around .
- - I would agree that this is pretty brutal but it lacks the artistic feel and pure sadism of the bull .
  - Fair enough ... no points for style .
- - Have they announced a timeline for that yet 
  - Not as far as I know  just that its being thought about . The idea was to have the shield ramp up instead of instant on .
- - David de Gea will move to Real Madrid then . Now more than certain .
  - in the summer he will  yes .
- - Kobe s shot was soo close  I wanted that in bad .
  - I m not even upset . That shot he hit over Pondexter before that was enough nostalgia for me .
- - Christina Weston Chandler is a transgendered woman . Not a man . Do nt be cissexist .
  - This is not a happy echo chamber . Go back to SRS .
- - Use NSFW tags  but tell your readers NSFW means spoilers and not actually nsfw . Or you could use link flair .
  - That sounds confusing to me but maybe I will try it out  thanks
- - Could be photoshopped  but I doubt it . Do nt know how they would have accessed it . Perhaps it s already set up ahead of time .
  - I can see it being photoshopped  seeing as tho the person is not scrolling thru in the video
- - Does nt seem worth it by itself . Guess we ll have to see with Necrochasm .
  - It ll be nice to have another arc primary option that s an auto rifle . But yes  Eidolon Ally has problems by itself .
  - It s also apparently torn between being a pulse rifle and auto rifle .
  - I bet the magazine increase when you upgrade it with the Crux since it increased after the first time you upgrade it
- - Should sorta mention that Hickman is sorta doing his own version of Crisis on Infinite Earths .
  - That sounds interesting . what would I need to read to follow that  Thanks .
- - He comes from the future  Do nt trust him .
  - Haha . I messed up when I was writing and decided to go with cos its all the piece of paper I had . Lol
- - If we get Ryan  I want Revis
  - NSFW . Hypothetical scenario ; now I ca nt get up from my desk .
- - I think im going to talk to ccp ... see if we can do something
  - Please do nt this idea is terrible .
- - Too many people on campus during the first week of classes . They ca nt HANDLE the bandwidth .
  - Why would there be more people during the first week  The classes will only get harder ...
- - Or have cash money dollars  that works too .
  - Only works if your name is Dolla Billions
- - Drow reminds me of a frog here specially the way those legs are twitching . Also tits way too big .
  - An Ice frog  perhaps  Tits are fine to me .
- - It s pretty much always a waveland out of the shine  unless they never leave the ground in which case it s probably a waveshine .
  - It s not a waveland . He literally jumps up into the air  shines  and drops back down .
- - By that argument newspaper editors should self-censor everything that anyone could find offensive .
  - But they do . Newspapers self sensor all the time when it comes to controversial subjects or views .
- - It would have broken down for sure if they drove it that far
  - That s what they all said about the lotus too .
- - i was working what happened and why would it get edited 
  - I did nt get to see it  but from what I gathered  RT made really bad Rape jokes and some people are getting butt hurt over them .
- - What I suggested is impossible ... It s theoretically what you want .
  - well i guess pressing z exactly on the node is pretty close  thats what you meant  right 
- - Not married . Actually getting married tomorrow .
  - How nice . All the best wishes .
- - Interesting choice . Sounds like a GM upgrade to me .
  - We need someone that can actually scout and has an eye for talent instead of relying of Free Agents .
- - Thigh gap is caused by the angle of the hips  nothing more . Some women could be skeletons and their stood would be no gap  and visa versa
  - Well  if you are morbidly obese you wo nt have one regardless of angles .
- - I did the same thing  and my daughter gets the same compliments . I m quite sold on baby talk being rubbish .
  - I just thought it was something you do to be cute and funny  Do some people think it has benefits 
- - Would you be willing to sell it 
  - Yeah but not right now unless I got offered some insane amount . Looks so odd with my nintendo stuff .
- - To be fair  I could see almost any of us doing it . Then doing it again .
  - I should have added context  I already did that
- - That s a JST connector  available at a lot of places . A quick search on Ebay or all the other shops should easily give you some options nearby .
  - Thank you but what exactly do I do with it  I have to the same set as in the picture so I must need it for something .
- - Margot Robbie for rising star  Really 
  - Completely ridiculous . I m glad Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley were recognised though .
- - Nope . Nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope . Nope 
  - Seriously dude  it s a fun procedure . With a Valium under your belt it will be one of your fondest memories .
- - I ve done it . It was good . Fronts are designed  in part  to enable that kind of play .
  - I m using Fronts in The West Marches  even 
- - Twitch For when you have that gaming itch Sometimes it can glitch But I try not to bitch
  - It should run without a hitch . Otherwise  it you should ditch .
- - Games without exploration . I love to wander the world .
  - Funnily enough I do nt mind . I ve always viewed JRPGs as my story corridor with some combat . I really like to explore on my second playthough though .
- - Secretly watch to see if his smart phone or tablet go in with him each time .
  - Are there people who do nt bring something into the bathroom 
- - Damn  it s all about perspective . I like this one more .
  - I like good people doing good things .
- - Did you buy a lot of gifts and not get much in return 
  - Lol well i may have already spent my gifts on the steam sale already .
- - If you consider the series to be the first three books  I agree .
  - They go from strength to strength between one and three . From four onwards it s just a sad decline .
- - I did nt buy a VIDEO GAME so I could simulate being a soldier in an actual army who apparently blindly follows orders but can google about conflicts in my downtime .
  - but thats exactly what you did ... you just didnt know . as a guardian you certainly are a soldier of the vanguard ... which is the army of the traveler .
- - Should I have Perron or Downie on my team  No hits or blocks and I already have crosby .
  - Depends what you lack in ... points you want Perron . PIM you want Downie .
- - I think you need to contact ea support . That is the only thing that I can find on internet
  - meh ... i ll go play CSGO instead now lol . thanks for your help man 
- - Look man I do nt want no trouble .
  - I am all about the bass about the bass no trouble .

- - Think you have nt added me yet  you re not showing up on my list anyway .
  - haha  crap  off by a number . Sorry . p
- - I know this will most likely not give you any super powers  but you ca nt truly know until you try . I m sure those plants will look great 
  - I can make a salad with the leaves from my grown plant . I ll have to try it sometime soon  superpowers would be worth it .
- - Damn  if only I had an amazon card right now  and was nt in school .
  - My school got cancelled  but I do nt have an Amazon card .
- - American Beauty  The Butterfly Effect  and Coherence are all amazing .
  - I loved American Beauty and The Butterfly Effect . Coherence sounds interesting so I ll add that .
- - Instructions were unclear dick got stuck in my drain pipe
  - Do nt worry thats suppossed to happen .
- - You probably could nt find anything because Indiana does nt tax individuals  personal property  it only taxes business personal property . Is the vehicle for business 
  - No  it s my personal vehicle . So this means I wo nt owe any taxes on it 
- - yeesh  bold statement . I hope you re wrong too .
  - Jones track record on grudge matches is nt that great  entertainment-wise
- - So I take it you do nt wan na buy any death sticks ...
  - And he just quoted one of the prequels  It s a bold strategy cotton lets see if it works out for him
- - I d love it if Askren showed up in a CM Punk disguise and snuck into the UFC .
  - IT S ME DANA  IT WAS ME ALL ALONG DANA

- - The fish that creates light with sound . That one deserves an answer i think .
  - I m gon na need a link to this fish . This sounds crazy m
- - Glad you think that telling Jews to go back to Germany is appropriate and awesome . Have fun  champ .

  - Yeah lol hve u watched the Anime before 
- - Oh no  Think of the traffic

  - No  I have nt seen it  but I have seen Doctor Who . Which part were you referring to 
- - Whew  very hot . Thank you 
  - Thanks for letting me know you liked it . D

  - The story started when she showed them where to go to find him .

  - A personal attack  I m shocked .

- - literally just threw up from the stress of that game
  - I ve actually done this before . That fumbled hold . I m sure you remember . But enough somber reminiscing . We won 
- - The root of the problem is the problem  not the symptom .
  - Exactly  and you re confusing the two .
- - I ve been trying to get into Graces because the combat seems really cool but man ... every character is such a turd .

  - You need to shut up before I beat you up
- - This is some really sick shit . I could nt watch the whole clip .

  - Yeah  hoping to find on amiami since I keep missing them . Preordered on BBTS just in case for now .
- - Tear them up . Saute with butter and garlic . Finish with additional butter and lemon juice . Toss in pasta and parm . Will really highlight the mushroom flavour .
  - Simple  but delicious idea . Thanks 
- - God  I hate metal so much . The guy s points are good though .
  - It s not my cup of tea either but all his advice works regardless on your genre .
- - I ve never even heard of a fucking bath bomb meme until I saw this . The internet is stupid and weird and I do nt know why I m here .
  - Eh  it s probably the porn . That s why I m here .
- - He looks homeless . Perhaps the only clothes he could salvage were woman s clothes . Shame on you .
  - i thought it was a guy ... but ... tits

  - I hear a song from another time ...
- - Is this a still from an episode  I think I recognize it  but I ca nt think of the episode .
  - Yah is it from the ember island one

  - They re hair extensions  the light colors are extensions  they need to go under her real hair so you ca nt see the top bits .
- - Which explains the cat s expression of disgust and disapproval .
  - Disapproval  It s obvious the cat loves balls .
  - Plot twist . OP is a girl .
  - That explains where the cat gets it from .
- - Yes  because Tumblr is going around literally murdering people for making racist jokes . Fucking hell .
  - Why take a life when you can just take someones career 
- - Then Inshaallah the great cyclist philosophers will one day be merciful enough to awaken us all from our poor unexamined lives and lift the false consciousness . Ameen .
  - A little introspection does nt require intervention . We can but hope .
- - That s not it  but is it good coffee 
  - I thought you were referring to Ritual too . Yes it s really good coffee . Especially their espresso .
- - I wish stuff like this happened in my games .
  - If you get a friend and have the necessary cards  it can happen in your games too
