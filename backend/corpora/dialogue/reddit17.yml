- - Pretty awesome  thanks for posting that photo .
  - NP  evidently used to be a gold mining area .
- - good play by iginla to get that break away but he could have made that in if he was a little more patient
  - He has nt been paired back with Tangs quite long enough to learn that again yet .
- - Wow I quit a month ago but smug dipshits like you are the reason I started in the first place .
  - you started smoking because people were too smug about the health hazards of smoking  That s hard to believe .
- - He looked so eager to talk at first  I am not impressed with his acting career .
  - Good thing he s not an actor then .
- - If it is completely shut down then you are likely out of luck unless you want to try dismantling it .
  - well  is there a button on the inside i can hit and itll turn on 
- - Wow  that sounds nice . Thanks for all the info . Any chance they give you pre-sale access to concerts and stuff 
  - No  not to my knowledge . Maybe for better seats they do that 
- - awww she knows how to spell her name .

- - I knew exactly what you were talking about  unfortunately .
  - Ca nt even name the sport  what are you talking about 
- - What are Rams fans supposed to do  Root for the Rams 
  - Seriously  it will be difficult but it looks like the best chance to keep the Rams here is to support them like never before .
  - If the city gets behind the Rams and the fans go crazy for the team I sincerely hope they stay in St Louis .
  - Unless we exponentially grow our tv market in one year I dont see that happening . It really does nt matter how many fans are in the seats anymore .
- - Same applies for Germany . I was really wondering why anyone would even want to mention WhatsApp and then I noticed that it might not be as popular in other countries .
  - I learned this recently . I wondered why one of my friends in Germany was not on Facebook . Turns out he uses whatsapp .
- - PvP in general is not balanced for shit . Paladins and Rogues are steamrolling everyone in ridiculous fashion .
  - May want to add ferals to this list ...
- - Do you have song of flame on or the reborn perk  I m betting the reborn perk . You need both  stacked  to go crazy with the grenades .
  - Really  I did not know that Song of Flame increased it even further . Do you run this most often or do you stick with Reborn 
- - hercules starts off as a skinny dude and as the match progresses he gets buffer and buffer  or as he gets kills idk

- - Merely scoring on that drive is nt enough to insure you do nt lose by double figures .
  - Sorry . Who s to say we would nt have scored a touchdown anyways  You do nt know if you would have held us to a fg or not

  - I must be tripping too  I see it aswell 
- - You have no idea of semiotics  so please refrain from lecturing me .
  - Yeah but it has no bearing on this conversation so ...
- - I figure they re like Pokemon Natures . You work with what you ve got  and only the crazy try to get the best .
  - Except it s so easy to get the best nature and perfect stats in pokemon that your comparing apples and oranges .
- - If you really wan na get better i HIGHLY recommend watching this . What better way to learn than to learn from a professional

  - Twas merely a conversation starter . And start a conversation it did . c .
- - Dear god put him back in against anybody but Stoke
  - Against who  Man City would be a bigger gamble and we ca nt afford to bench him until the Aston Villa game .
- - Cause we do nt have tier sets  yet

  - Mother Russia has balls  Where did they get them  Olympic training 
- - I just recently got my DSLR . I do a lot of video editing work . I want to learn videography . Is learning photography beneficial

  - And me  the token straight guy who loves the show
- - If I was getting shot at I would probably opt speed over technique  something to keep in mind .
  - That s where training kicks in . You do nt even think about it  muscle memory and all that .
- - I mean ... there have been leaf jerseys on the ice while they re in a wildcard spot
  - When your team has millions of fans  there are bound to be quite a few idiots .
- - It s approximately as shitty as it was when you left .
  - Not a bad thing at all  Yay for an easy reintroduction period .
- - They interviewed him before Summerslam and just now released it 
  - I watched this same interview back around summerslam . They re just bringing it up again because it s relevant

  - A horror game called Five Nights at Freddy s

  - true things are often sad but we must face reality in order to do something about it living in a world of fantasy helps no one .
- - Yeah  he seems a bit more professional and focused . He s really stepped it up since leaving Game Grumps .
  - More professional and focused for sure . Ca nt really say more entertaining though .
  - Got ta disagree there . I ve loved season two  of JonTron a lot more than the previous episodes . The new ones just feel more well made and fun .
  - Me too . And thats coming from someone who has been watching Jon Tron since the Joe and Mac episode .
- - And they say the random crap you never can expect is only for the old Halos .
  - Well it does happen more often in old Halos .

- - If we do nt have the infrastructure to put out a burning oil train  we sure as shit do nt have the infrastructure to put out a burning pipe line .
  - Well pipelines are safer and do nt burst into flame spontaneously . A train wreck can because of the engine fuel and sparks and friction occurring during the wreck .
  - The point is that if they are both very safe low risk options  what is the point of spending billions to upgrade in the name of safety 
  - You never made that point until now . You were just talking about infrastructure to fight spills resulting in fires .
- - Then it sounds like you have the opportunity of a lifetime here .
  - Walmart would have taken advantage already if it was a worthwhile venture . I ll choose their multimillion dollar market research budget over my half-baked cynicism any day .

- - Once again  fuck me for having an opinion on what a fight in practice does .
  - You are allowed to have an opinion  and we are just pointing out that the opinion is not based on any sort of factual evidence or knowledge of the specific situation
- - Well it worked  because thats exactly what I did
