- - Ugh ... I m cringing at you  genius ...

- - Jesus was human  and human temptations are rarely rational . That said  I would nt doubt that there was some eye-rolling .
  - Do you think Christians would argue that Jesus acted irrationally 
- - Islam is nt a race  it s a religion . Judging people on the basis of their beliefs and actions is completely legit .
  - I love how we can criticize any philosophy on it s merits but if you condemn Islam . Boom  you re a racist .

  - The English try that never touched the ground but was still awarded

- - heroin causes people to die if they try to quit . That s why there s methadone . with alcohol  there s no methadone  you have to taper off

- - Am I missing something  It was really short and not scary 
  - I missed it too  I guess .
- - Muscles can only get bigger or smaller  or have less body fat obscuring them .
  - Yeah but there are different ways in which they can grow and sometimes a smaller muscle can be stronger than a larger one .
- - The deal with Destination America is a comfortable deal  They have absolutely no idea of what kind of ratings they might get .
  - They re safe there dude . They ve been building their network around them . I d never even heard of this channel before they got TNA
- - Does nt look like that rail sees much use .
  - They re either brand new and have nt been ground yet or the line is just unused due to the construction working .
- - Wonder what this means for the youtube videos  Will they just take longer now and be huge files 
  - Almost certainly  yes . But they ll be dope .
- - They give the pro players accounts . I do nt know where people get the idea that riot does nt like smurfing from
  - Ikr  hell  most riot members have smurfs

  - That s the Mavs GM  I agree  the Mavs team came together oh so nicely

  - Because it ll put butts in the seats 
- - Also got Falcon  Mac and Pit earlier this week . Glad for you 
  - Thanks  I m waiting for Pitt to ship from amazon . If only I had this luck with getting MVT .
- - Retail is the centre of the economy in case you have nt noticed . And I think everyone here agrees that you re a tool .
  - Yes  but there are many more sectors . Everything in the US boils down to retail . When is the last time you saw walmart mow somebody s lawn though 
  - Most people mow their own lawn with something they bought at Wal Mart .
  - Or Home Depot . We do nt sell lawn mowers at the walmart that I work at .
- - Move over  Marvel . We know who the real Winter Soldier is .

  - For now . They re probably just having him test a bunch out until they like one .
- - Chris Brown . I m egotistical and confrontational .
  - You may be egotistical and confrontational  but surely there s someone who d be more fitting than Chris Brown  
  - I like singing  dancing  and I used to get in lots of fights .
  - ha . fair enough . but Chris Brown did beat Rihanna .
- - I think hercules does ridiculous dmg with basic attacks and with that dash .
  - Right even with mostly defense items he can go support and do crazy damage .
- - That is possibly the nicest coat of fur I ve ever seen on a dog  cool dog if it s yours . Any idea what breed 
  - It s actually a mutt . His fur is very nice but its look in the photo may be a bit exaggerated .
- - Sure thing  I m on now  let me trade you .
  - cool  thanks alot . D  o wow hatching power too  ty 
- - Reading through this thread  I realize I know nothing about this pirating world .
  - Same  I have never pirated anything so this is all new to me . It seems like it s all lies 
- - so by the responses so far it seems that most people do not have confidence in the utility and value of doge  Why is this 
  - They have confidence it will rise  not that much in one year however .
  - Is nt this community all about shooting for the moon though  Screw realistic .
  - A lack of sensibility and realism will kill our currency .
  - I doubt a mantra and senseless enthusiasm will kill anything .
  - It s not practical to shoot for something unreasonable right now . That was my point .
- - Could you do it for me  The two colors are in my first comment
  - Sure thing  I ll PM you on Skype with the results when I get around to it .
- - The best . Maybe of his entire category . So fucking powerful .
  - It s the fact that it seemed to be perfectly written for him to suddenly close with when he killed off Ziggy . And so he did .
- - Odd fact . while asparagus will mess with everyone s pee  not everyone is capable of detecting that odor . Ca nt recall why . So we are Special .
  - My sister can not smell asparagus pee  stink bugs  nor does she get brain freezes .
  - Whoa  whoa  whoa . No brain freezes   If we can just unlock that genetic code  there s billions to be made 
  - I know  it s amazing . She never understood what purple were talking about when it came to brain freezes . I look at something cold and I get one .
- - With money  a brain  an education and a respect for women not formed in a frat house .
  - Just so you know  many fraternities do respect women . At least in the south .
- - Technically that s true . It s also true of every team in every game  since the opponents are an active human force working against them .
  - What if their opponents are the Titans 
- - Does anybody have a link to that picture 
  - Sorry  the picture is nt real  this is just a theory of mine  Fingers crossed that it becomes real real soon
- - I m a CSS wizard  if the mods want to contact me I will make it happen
  - lol they can just move them a few pixels and change their images lol
- - Let s take a second to remember that Lee is a freshman .
  - That is exciting . One of our best defenders out there tonight .

- - When I go ask this girl out today . Probably wo nt help that I have nt slept a wink and I look like hell .
  - So go catch up on sleep and make yourself look better
- - I only have objections to the conclusions people draw from it .
  - And others have objections to your conclusions too . All have their opinions and thats what makes discussion interesting .
- - I think a lot of people are interested  and more and more would notice and be excited the more robust it becomes 
  - Well ... I ll surely consider it  in the future . Thanks 
- - Jesus christ Smith is so fucking bad . Might as well play him I guess we lost .
  - I could nt have said it any better

- - I paid my friends mortgage payments for a few months when he lost his job and was looking for another one .
  - you re a good friend - I hope they appreciated it .
- - Ours is best because it s short .
  - The best part is the unwritten bit at the end .
- - Gold star vaporeon and base set vaporeon yes . Were you interested in anything from my binder or looking to sell 
  - Um  I d be interested in your SR Ultra Ball and maybe your FA Supporters  if we could find a trade from within that .
- - That s their fat activism for the day .
  - That s their only activity for the day
- - I do nt think she asked for a ceremonial cake obliterating .
  - We d were going to have a ceremonial cake obliterating at our wedding but decided not to because the council imposed a ban on wheat and wheat by-products .
- - Dude what ... Who the fuck bills their friends
  - The kind of person that thinks you owe them for a soda they gave you . Not a real friend .
- - It only appears hypocritical if you mistake TRP for a moral point of view  which it explicitly and unapologetically is not .
  - TRP claims to be amoral  but I cant see how it is functionally anything but immoral .
- - Super Smash Bros is definitely worth the buy  And I have nt heard of that series  I ll have to look at it 
  - it s bizarre haha . maybe I will buy it for him  that s a great gift idea because his birthday is coming up . D thank you
- - TOO LATE  It s official . Your division is now the best in CFB for at least the offseason .
  - If UGA is good at anything  it s being the best in the offseason .
- - Trade you some peanut butter for your jalapeno cheese spread ...
  - Trade of the century when you find someone who loves jalapeno cheese spread
- - you dont need to type a description  you can submit a post with just a title . The text body is optional
  - Some mobile apps require text in the body
- - Yeah but for all those online tournaments and qualifiers  ping is going to be an issue
  - I think this lineup should qualify to anything they want with one player having latency issues .
- - He fell down the hole he made in the floor with the chainsaw ...
  - what was the reason behind this hole 
- - I can think of at least five things  but I do nt know if it s legal to suggest them to you .
  - lol I think im not ready for all that yet lol
- - That will hunt me for a really long time .
  - Hunt  haunt - I was going to correct you but I think you re on point either way . That is terrifying .
- - I do nt have any advice but I m curious as to what you do and how you got there . Purely so I can copy you . p
  - I got very very very lucky . I run a division for a profitable software company that I was an early employee at .
- - Good Sir  I do believe that was fantastic .
  - Right  Props to Open Minded  apparently they re doing more Fallout stuff too .
- - Downvote me to hell . But the open acceptance of cultures is not only unique to the US .
  - you re right  but NOBODY DOES IT LIKE MURICA  NOW GET OVER HERE 
- - so back then it wasnt infinite  I thought they only changed the position of the ult shadow
  - IIRC when they changed the position of the shadows they had a max range  but it was bugged and way cooler so they kept it i could be totally wrong though
- - As a long-time Minnesota North Star fan  I can assure you that this is nt J.P. s shining moment . He was a great player .
  - You re right  I probably gave this post the wrong title . But this is always the first thing I think of when I hear his name .
- - Thursday s work for me . Sounds like a good start to the upcoming weekend .
  - My thinking exactly . Byob of course .
- - If you exploit someone for personal gain .
  - So I ca nt employ staff for my business to succeed 
- - Well  they ve been coming at a very predictable rate . If that rate CHANGES ... it could be trouble . Otherwise  they re just idiots .
  - Maybe it s because we have nt been fighting hard enough 
  - I ve been farming it all I ve got captain  I ca nt get loot any faster 
  - MERCHANT  MAN DOWN HERE  HIS BAGS ARE FULL 
- - I find lee to be a bigger potter fan  she talks about it way more .
  - But Trisha always wears her Deathly Hallows necklace and always wants to live in the Harry Potter world .
- - But a syringe full of unidentified blood is a totally justifiable response to someone being pro-GG .
  - Was it confirmed to be blood  I do nt recall Milo ever saying
  - You re right  he mentioned he s not in a rush to find out . I must have presumed .
  - I imagine it s in police hands at this point .
  - And so will these boxes  unless Kluwe is full of hot air .
  - The police are nt going to collect a bunch of boxes . They will call it a prank and laugh about it when he leaves the office .
- - They have unlimited access to time but ca nt find a single moment . That s burning my brain right now .
  - they can navigate all of our dimensions but they do nt have an understanding of how each of us are connected to one another within our dimensions .
- - Got any of the story behind this  It s an eloquent picture .
  - You asked before I could get the comment posted . See our other comment for the information .
- - Is the game any good  I m still picking my free ubisoft game .
  - If you do nt have Rayman Legends or Origins they are both great .
- - Do you already have monitors  a keyboard  and a mouse 
  - Yep  I m just replacing the rig with something higher performance . The other stuff can stay .
- - Love it when big projects are taken care of like that . It s always such a relief . Now go lift big 
  - Well  it was more that my test was good so now I can get down to the big project . But we re well on our way 
- - You posted a selfie and I m like she has a nice smile
  - was this in the summer or recently  i was around in the summer for a bit but then i came back here
- - Happy new year everyone . I started off the new year by ordering my first pair of SLP jeans .
  - Same to you  Do you have a photo  Which ones did you cop 
- - I m not sure how hard this would be as I m not a developer  but just strengthen them depending on how many people are against you
  - Exactly this . They should keep stronger defensive options in higher player modes and gradually decrease them in modes with less players .
- - Fuck no . I ca nt stand his pop movie reviews and going with trends . He is a lame YouTube movie critic .
  - Yeah his favourite director is Nolan . Cmon now  can you get anymore pleb
- - What ink  Also should nt Cumberbatch s be on separate pages 
  - It is Noodler s Turquoise Eel . Ha  I do nt have a book big enough to contain his eyes 
- - That s true but they never been also a Eastern . Actually whole history Poland is fucked up by both sides ...
  - Poland is Central Europe  Germany as well .
- - Yep  ca nt wait til I see my friends tomarrow . School continues
  - Ugh i hate going back to school ... my anxiety gives me such bad butterflies in my stomache that it has actually made me throw up before ...
- - Does anybody know how to mute the commentators without muting the rest of the sound  That stadium is absolutely insane
  - Usually it s surround sound  mute center channel . Alternatively  the skycam feed if you can find it .
- - The shrimp store called  they re running out of you .
  - Are you the guy who fucked a projector 
- - Are you the guy throwing pumpkins around my city 
  - No that s the Green Goblin I bet .

- - apologize for the creeping but my nigga patrick looking cleaner than a mfer . I see you fam 
  - Ayyyy you know fam tryna grab pieces here and there
- - WHY WOULD ANYONE THINK BITING ANYTHING ANYWHERE CLOSE TO DOWNSTAIRS IS A GOOD IDEA .
  - Knew a girl who the first time she went down on a girl she bit her clit . Apparently she had never really explored down there on herself .
- - Did someone run the show backwards  Like dolph and bnb were the main event but Russo held the script upside down 
  - Kevin Dunn has the script upside down on his clipboard .
- - You can if you go to audio suite choose a reverb and render the clip .
  - Generally not advised though . Automation  while more work  is usually better .
- - Why on earth would you want to do that ...
  - I would do it for shits and giggles  but I m sure there s a valid reason to do this .
- - How big would you like it  It ll have to be pretty big for the axes and things to really work nicely .
  - Yeah  Hmm . Maybe eighteen inches across  Is that too small 
- - Sorry eclectic did nt realize the rules were updated  I ll go read them over .
  - no worries  it will take a while for people to get used to them . Thank you for understanding .
- - Passive should be tweaked . Like he probably should nt lose stacks of the passive .
  - they changed it so that he does nt lose stacks before the rework was even officially released .
- - That s weird  can you take pictures 
  - I shall do that in a couple seconds .
- - That was very satisfying  thanks for letting me get off with you . You did want me to get off with you  right 
  - not that that s creepy or anything .
- - Extremist already want to blow us up . No need to give them more reasons .
  - Well we all might as well convert then .
- - Look in items then unopened packs or go to binder and sort by newest
  - That s the first thing I did . Thanks anyways
- - you ve got kane for cover with di maria s price dropped i d say it s a good time to bring him in
  - good point . and worse comes to worse if he does pick up an injury there s a lot of good trades to be made at that price .
- - Good pints it does seem a little desperate .
  - Down voted why  For saying the poster made good points 
- - Looking at it in such moralistic terms is misleading . Germany s exports have benefited greatly from the weak Eurozone members
  - Yes they have  to some limited extent . And therefore 
- - You re talking about youtube like it s some fledgling start-up . It makes billions of dollars annually .
  - And where do they get their money 
- - I m curious about this one . What do you mean by crystal dumps  You sacrifice crystals to a fodder unit then fuse that fodder to the targetted unit 
  - I think it s more like he sold crystals for unit space .
- - You ca nt possibly do this to me  What idea do you have  
  - I just ... I FEEL YOUR PAIN  OK   D .
  - Oh  yeah . I wo nt be there much longer though  so that s a relief .
  - Congrats  Savor the freedoms they give you there  though . You ll miss it later .
- - Spewing diarrhea all over the victims corpse . EDIT . It was the first thing that pooped into my head when I saw the question  So I went with it .
  - Would nt you get identified fairly quickly with this one 
- - how sharp is it  can it slice a piece of paper like from the phone book 
  - It will shave hair off my arm .
- - Take a wild guess  or is this just spam 
  - Spam  No . So  Broncos then but what do you mean it does nt work 
- - This is incredible . You guys go nuts over there 
  - Yeah  this is at my parents house and they live in a pretty quiet neighborhood so there was a lot more going on elsewhere .
- - Gon na post it after some time .
  - Good idea . Hopefully it will have the same amount of praise as this post .
- - Damn  we should have thought of just asking before 
  - I know right  How silly were we  
- - Because there should nt be legislation . It would violate the first amendment .
  - threats are not covered in the first amendment
- - It s so straining on the eyes  My dad keeps telling me how he isnt paying to light the whole neighborhood  but this darn horseshoe is just so vibrant 
  - Technically it would be whiter when faded and there for brighter .
- - I love when they do the Lion King cam at Pepsi Center
  - What s that  Do they throw you onto the ice and let a heard of Zambonis run you down 
- - Okay . So pegula has made more money this year than he has spent  and that includes buying the buffalo fucking bills . Insane
  - With the crude oil prices crashing  is Pegula impacted  I ve heard that a lot of the American fracking operations are hurting .
- - Are you answering ironically or do you actually believe that 
  - I am answering it out of personal experience . I am not the only one who has had these effects  either .
- - It looks really nice  Good job .
  - thx  hope he gets back to me so i can finish it close to his style . the font is still off and i need to adjust the timing .
- - The progressive city planners plans  in the video  are  in their eyes  perfection .
  - Well now you re into the realm of speculation and assumption . Nobody argues that city planning is perfect  not even the planners .
- - Oh  well  that makes it okay then .
  - I m no fan of it  but it s unfair to single out Gerrard in this case .
- - I was worried he was nt going to make that pass . A few months ago he probably would nt have . The Sevilla loans are working 
  - I thought the same  really glad he followed through .
- - Good thing they blurred those vaginas  would nt want to see anything obscene .
  - Laws and stuff but how do they censor their vaginas for the spectators 
- - Just watched it yesterday  Episode VI is on my list for today 
  - Same here . Gon na be great 
- - FSU is trying out Wisconsin s big boy running game . Turns out it is nt the easiest thing to do
  - They do nt have the most necessary piece . A baby giraffe at QB
- - Bingo . They exist because there s a demand for them .
  - Yeah but there seems to be so many  and they re so busy . I d never seen one before moving to phoenix .
- - I have a crippling love of Mexican food .
  - On behalf of all Mexicans  finish that enchilada .
- - fair call guess it wasnt meant to be
  - Lol  no  no it was nt  just writing it out made me realize how unhealthy it was .
- - Just as I suspected  a shit tonne of suggestions for BJs ... and girls say they do nt understand us 
  - We are but simple creatures  with simple needs and desires .
- - I would suggest checking out Butterfingers . They are an Australian hip hop group that I find enjoyable to listen to and I can hardly stand hip hop or rap music .
  - Listening to then now . Pretty cool stuff . They re like Australia s take on rap-rock and it s done much better than the US  rap-rock imo .
- - Interestingly  from your edit  it does look like you give a fuck .
  - I did nt always . Must be getting old . More interestingly  is snatch a verb or noun 
- - Yes  you need to uninstall the game and download again to play
  - Wow  crazy . Figured it would just work . Thanks of the news  I deleted and I m re-downloading .
- - The Sixth Sense . I did nt pick up on the clues throughout the movie so the ending really caught me off guard .
  - Very true  but watch it the second time around and you feel impossibly stupid for missing all those obvious signs 
- - This has happened to me far far to many times
  - will happen to me again soon  too  I think . I need to try this with splash potions of harming
- - Im new to NFL . How is it looking for us so far  WHO DEY 
  - Could be worse  but we re still in it  Welcome brother 
- - I could tell because no one runs slash tires for racing unless it s on carpet
  - Those are nt slash tires  they re Speed tread Upshot pavement tires .
- - I hope Jameis consented . Otherwise  FSU might have to open another investigation .
  - Nope . His panties had duck semen on them .
- - I understand what you are trying to put across in this story but it simply is nt true .
  - I think his point s well taken .
- - what would happen if you ate one ... 
  - You d probably just have mud butt for few days .
- - Your post has been removed . Please read the rules before posting .
  - I did  What rule did I break 
- - Leave the state for awhile if they can .
  - Cancel their health insurance . Or opt-out of the chemo at the insurance . Let s see how fast they drop the case .
- - Rob Ford would have fallen but he would have gotten right back up too .
  - The difference is he would have fallen even without the ice  and he would have sworn comically afterward .
- - Guess what with  zoo  what a surprise .
  - no other deck gets so many games in such a short time  also it is his best deck and i think one can argue that his is the best zoo player
- - My dog does nt comprehend his size vs. the size of the bed either ... always half a body hanging off .
  - Yeah she really does nt understand that she s a giant haha . She always wants to play with little dogs and cats .
- - I have the skills and software . But it s late and in tired .
  - Same exact excuse I use for my stat class
- - Most of those blacks were redistributed to Clayton County .
  - Yeah  its pretty bad around those parts . Its spreading down to where I live now .
- - In know it gets said a lot  but it bears repeating - Atlanta are legit . Watching them beat up the clippers was great . Fuck the Clippers 
  - This was a good night for Dubs fans .
- - Black to the Future Pretty much the same thing except Doc and Marty are black  imagine if Tyler Perry direct BttF
  - and Tyler Perry would be both Doc and Marty  in typical Tyler Perry fashion .
- - Raildex would definitely be pretty high up there . Can talk about potential powers and their implications or matchups forever .
  - or argue about who power could beat whos for a decade
- - Amazing . I hope you find time to finish the story as quickly as you can . You have talent  my friend .
  - Thanks a lot  I just finished it . I hope you enjoy it 
- - You re doing God s work . Thanks 
  - Hahaha  it was your post that inspired me to look for these . Almost ready to get started now . D .
- - How do you do your poppers  It s not something I grew up with  but I know what I devour at parties ...
  - I usually pop the cap and huff away .
- - A fat person might instinctively take a bite out of him . Too risky .
  - It s the snack that bites back 
- - Stop using videos to distract us from that username .
  - One day you re happy  one day you re upset . But she does nt feel any different .
- - Sold a girl oregano but told her it was weed
  - If you ca nt tell the difference  you re probably too young to smoke anyway .
