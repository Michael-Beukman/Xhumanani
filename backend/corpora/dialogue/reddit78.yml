- - Why hasnt alqaeda and ISIS attacked Isreal  Or isreal never attacking terrorist groups in syria and even treating the injured fighters . Do they have a truce 
  - My guess is that Israel would be a much more formidable foe than small villages in the Levant .
- - BRAY VS AMBROSE IN A CHICKEN PARM MATCH NEXT WEEK ON RAW  MAGGLE . I LOVE IT 
  - CHICKEN PARM ON A POLE MATCH THIS WEEK ON SMACKDOWN  THE LAST TIME EVER ON FRIDAYS  MAGGLE  I LOVE IT

  - The worst thing about Mills is he thinks he s some expert on City even though I think almost the whole club has changed since he left .
- - Volumes  Wormholes is a pretty good beginner song
  - Hahaha I ve been playing for nine years and it took me three months to learn that song .
- - I noticed that when a gif or video is playing it the phone automatically lowers the sound of everything so maybe that s the problem .
  - I noticed that yesterday as well  never paid attention before I guess .
- - It s even in the linked thread . It s almost as if the person posting did nt read it properly .
  - You re right  that part has been retracted .
- - Anyone wan na bet the Wild have a new goaltender by Sunday 
  - That s exactly what I was thinking . Would ve been fun to have these problems very early and have Brodeur ...
- - It s not introductory because it s basically nothing like any other DG album .
  - Let s be real . Is any Death Grips album like any other Death Grips album 
- - Use of the word b o m b automatically disqualifies you from flying  read the signs in the airport
  - You would think so . But apparently that isnt the case .

  - To be fair  to many people theres no difference between blowing a little Richard or sucking it
- - So ... anyone hear about that new Sniper movie  Looks good  huh 
  - A screener may or may not be available on the website of your choosing .
- - This is awesome . If I tried a project like this I would probably lose at least one finger .
  - No missing fingers yet but we are working on it .
- - Apparently Canada also has trolls . TIL .
  - And like the rest of the animals  never feed the trolls .
- - Yes  and even in the first movie they briefly show her getting waxed . It has a very specific purpose  just like showing off before the Games begin does .
  - Plus even in the movie she has to appeal to the rich donors to survive .
- - Do you understand statistics or how polls work  You do nt need to ask every single person to get an accurate representation on a population .
  - And polls show that polls are notoriously wrong
- - I have the same problem with a few other npcs . Did you ever find a fix 
  - Hmm i did fix it ... I think it was yield somthing

- - He is always just fucking standing there alone in the moonlight
  - He can smile at the old days  he was beautiful then
- - This and Person of Interest are the go to shows for The Wire actors it seems
  - Speaking of the wire  I met herc at a nye party a few years back ... Real nice guy ... Down to earth
  - Awesome  hated what he ended up doing on the show though LOL
  - I ve honestly never watched the show lol
  - Time to start  It got released in HD too recently so great time
  - I ll have to check it out . I ve never heard a bad thing about it
- - Because she exists for the sole purpose to get a man and his attention . Yay feminism  we ve come so far
  - Well  if that man is a home health care worker  then yeah  that probably is going to be the sum total of her life s achievements .
- - flash your headlights if there s cops ahead
  - Be careful with this one . In my area this is illegal . It s considered interfering with police duties .
- - I d believe funnyjunk is pro GamerGate . I mean  I have nt really gone there since middleschool  but that s exactly why I think that .
  - Not everything stupid and evil likes everything else that s stupid and evil . Do nt be prejudiced against stupidity and evil .
- - While people do tend to have short memories  most of today s fans were nt around back then either .
  - A fair point but one that does nt excuse the perpetuation of a lie .
- - Better not have smoothing on with the shadows . That always gives me input lag .
  - It s smoothing you think  I ll give it a try and disable that .
- - You may be right  I do nt know enough about the topic . I was merely expressing my ideal  not necessarily something we could actually achieve
  - In a true utopia there would be no need for government because the people could Manage themselves
- - Is Harrison a good replacement for the Black Knight  Idk  I think I prefer Harrison over TBK in the current meta
  - Whatever works for you buddy  I m sure it works just fine .
- - Dunt dun dunt da dunt Dunt dun dunt da dunt Dunt dun dunt da dunt Dunt dun dunt da dunt dunt dun dun dun dunt dun dunt dun dun
  - Crap  I m really blanking right now . What are you going for here 
  - It is the best I could do for Duel of the Fates .
  - Do nt feel bad  it was immediately obvious to me 
- - I imagine that explains the lack of Inherent Vice also . Shame  I suppose it ll shine at the Oscars .
  - I watched IV last night  it s way too out there for voters . It ll be lucky if it even gets a screenplay nom .
- - I thought her nipples where going to fall off at one point .
  - Would nt suprise me . They look like they ve been glued on . Hope she got her money back for them .
- - All pro QBs force ball into coverage though . Key is to put the ball in the right spot to beat the coverage
  - But does he do that  I think a lot of those throws were late .
- - It s about as much as an MMO as something like dark souls .
  - I would nt consider Dark Souls an MMO . So  if that s what you were implying  I agree .
- - I wish there was a whole comic for this ...
  - It is part of an eroge  but try as I might I cant find its source
- - Contact their support to get explicit digital . I doubt anybody even bothered making a clean vinyl .
  - That s what I was thinking . Just double checking .
- - What does this mean for a novice like me 
  - More stable flight controller  and possibility to expand .
- - Oh  like an invitation to a circlejerk  It still was nt much of a contribution ...
  - Neither is the OP . So what 
- - Does this also work in campaign  Very cool .
  - Yes  got ta get that timing down though
- - This is the crap BIOS that comes with an American megatrends mobo .
  - American Megatrends does nt make motherboards . Mobo manufacturers buy BIOS software from companies like American Megatrends .
- - Hell the truck barely did anything . She totaled it with two handrails .
  - The handrails are attached to the truck though
- - The artist is the creator of beautiful things . To reveal art and conceal the artist is art s aim . Oscar Wilde - The picture of Dorian Gray
  - You hit a soft spot . I keep a copy of this book around like its the bible .
- - Just tuning in . Why is Driskel playing 
  - Offense was scoring a few too many points
- - A sexy redheaded woman with a killer smile and nice boobies .
  - Due to a slight glitch in programming she says hi and politely asks to use your phone to call her fiancee .
- - Pretty sure you must save game in order to trade so she probably wo nt be able to save those pokemons .
  - This . Not much you can do  man .
- - Add Blaziken to that favorite starter list .
  - In their defense  who dose nt love that fire ninja chicken 
- - Fair point . I ve been seeing those questions asked more electronically lately and tablets are making their way into the clinic .
  - Not fast enough  and clinics generally use their own software and systems which means I m out of luck if I go to a hospital or a different clinic .
- - Did you really just make another account to post this 
  - Nah . I made this account as me  to verify the fact that I did indeed insist on having my phallus stimulated last .
- - Well fuck him in the non sexual figurative sense not the literal p in the v sense .
  - Lol ... t was a joke  I swear .
- - The islamophobia is strong with this one .

- - screenshot pls  edit . I found it
  - Could you pm me a link as well 
- - It might be tricky to trim the back yourself without it looking uneven . Call a friend 
  - My boyfriend is my stylist . He is all about my hair .
- - I ve been trading quite a bit lately and everytime I get a zigzagoon  ralts  wurmple or poochyena I just release them
  - End their suffering  rather than prolong it .
- - Yep let me know when you re around
  - I m available now if you are .
- - It s OK to have sex for money as long as you film it so other people can watch LOL
  - Honestly  it s just not that simple Edit . otherwise I d have a camera in every hotel room . THAT S NOT HOW THE LAW WORKS
- - Do nt forget the classic Cory in the House
  - No  Corey s not anime  he s a busta .
- - You have no idea what you re talking about .
  - Then please enlighten me on how I m wrong . If you re in fact so very smart .
- - And Shia Lebouf has some good movies but I m not willing to dig through diarrhea to find a diamond .
  - I ca nt believe we live in a time with both Shia Lebouf and Jay Baruchel . The gods are cruel .

  - but that will happen too . All in good time  my friends  all in good time ...

  - Good luck  my friend . I think Klay is an upgrade to Kobe  depending on what you re punting and such  though .
- - Lift the file on the pull stroke . If you re applying pressure on the pull stroke you re only dulling the tool .
  - How long does a file usually last if used properly 
- - No announcements as yet  but I d love to see a second season .
  - Yeah it really needs another one to continue the story more would be amazing
- - Surprised this sub has a troll this early . I quite like Du Hast . Thanks for the link .
  - I m not even trolling  it s just that this is literally the dumbest post I have ever seen anywhere .
- - Hey are you aware that some Muslims actually killed people over a cartoon 
  - Are you aware that some psychopaths killed people for no reason 
  - No  there is a reason . And that reason has a firm base in religion . Stop being an apologist .
  - I was not talking about the extremists  rather just giving an example as to how psychopaths act ...
- - PM you a picture of my vagina .
  - Tell me how that goes ... Zach .
- - Why not  I think you ll find that most Indians you speak with about that would be sympathetic .
  - Yeah  I warn my friends as well
- - I really feel these are the two worst teams in the playoffs Sadly I also think Carolina will be losing to the Pats in the Superbowl .
  - Winner of this will likely have to go to seattle  and I do nt see that being a win for them .
- - Exploring the world . Too early to explore the universe too .
  - Explore for yourself not for the world . Search trails forests and island . You are exploring for yourself not for the history books though .
- - Looks like a cracked out Iggy Azalea .
  - She d probably take that as a compliment ...

- - Does nt look like Pearl really likes pie .
  - I think it s more  she knows it s gon na have to come out  like she was saying in Fusion Cuisine .
- - Absolutely  It s just extra clutter in my locker anyway .
  - Wow  thank you so much . Your town or mine 
- - It s due to be filled with fluids .
  - Got ta check that oil level with dip stick  open up
- - TL ; DR . Islamophobia is just like hatred of Jews in Nazi Germany .
  - Yea but last time I checked  the Jews were nt exactly bombing places  making death threats  or shooting up offices
- - If I can find a ride from Madison  I will most defiantly be there 
  - Excellent  Cocky and EDC are coming from that way so maybe yall can work something out .
- - Who has time to do all this  That would literally take days to collect
  - Minus the literally part . And even so  you d be getting much more MT than if you tried to earn it normally in that same amount of time .
- - I think you did a good job  but you introduce too many topics in too little time .
  - I need to trim and expand  I agree . Thanks 
- - St. Vincent is guaranteed to rock your socks off .
  - I hope hope hope she has David Byrne there for a Talking Heads song .
- - Nice work  thanks for the mention .
  - No problem  I m a big fan of your themes .
- - LVG sitting in the dugout rather than coming to the touch line benefits LVG the enigma more than Manchester United the team .
  - He said why though as they ca nt hear him properly if he were to shout anyway so it s quite useless . What he said that is .
- - two good posts in two hours  OP is ... on ... a ... roll .
  - Who are the people you linked to though 
- - as if TSM fans would click the link and not just read the comments
  - That hurt . But sadly that is probably true . But at least I know I read the article as a TSM fan .
- - well i never knew such a thing existed  i just eat a bag of potato crisps and a can of soda .
  - You eat a can of soda  Thats intense bro 
- - You can post this awesome picture with no details 
  - He s from the future  duh .
- - I d prefer spreadsheet lord extraordinaire . Or something to that effect .
  - Dark Lord of the Spreadsheet Empire  Order of Extraordinaire  First Class
- - No . Metric is better for everything .
  - Wow  when you put it that way  in such a detailed  compelling argument  I just ca nt disagree 
- - When life gives you cans of cream of celery soup ... make cream of celery soup  I guess .
  - Pour a can of that soup in a dish with a couple chicken breasts and bake ... nom nom nom
- - No  most large ships in sci-fi do not . They send small landing craft  because landing a large ship on a planet is wasteful .
  - Yeah  they sent the drop ship down to the planet and kept the main one in orbit .
- - Looks like they are hand built by one guy ... and really expensive 
  - Yeah  way to expensive for me . I d kill to own one though . Very light weight and sturdy feeling .
- - PC had a pretty bad year with a lot of really shitty AAA ports though .
  - Yes but atleast on pc there are people who make mods that fix the lazy job of the devs
- - God I m so happy we got Rondo
  - The Mavs are gon na end up being so good this year . I m excited
- - Its so odd reading your half of the conversation  it seems very innocent . The fact that the other user deleted everything makes me think otherwise ...
  - I was just answering the questions the other person asked . I have no idea why he or she ended up deleting .
- - Goodbye  troll ... go have delusions about some other conversation .
  - Have a good one  web trash .
- - how has no one mentioned she s drinking while on the bed  so thug the tea does nt spill .
  - The tea is afraid of what she will do to it if it steps outta line .
- - I ca nt argue with a single point there .
  - Yes but absolutely none of them appeal to the lowest common denominator which is what studios are going to do . People who think this way tend to be the minority .
- - Ignore everything other than the telegraph why do nt you  you twit . Come back when you learn how to structure an argument and provide some sources .
  - Ad hominem  no need for further replies .
- - Do nt you think knee on belly is a pretty obvious move 
  - Nothing is an obvious move on the ground . Many basic grappling techniques wo nt come naturally to a person unless he or she has learnt them from somewhere .
- - I use whatever hot sauce I have near me .
  - Got ta try with other hot sauces . Believe it or not tobasco on everything gets old real fast
- - Details on the construction of said board  I d like to build one ... Nice indeed 
  - Same  Looks like it folds up like a board game  and the border is pretty cool . Thanks 
- - Yeah  but aversion therapy does nt work .
  - It definitely does  just with side effects
- - CONGRATS it does nt matter if it s water weight or not if it pushed you to keep going it s all that matters 
  - My thoughts exactly  Thank you for the kuddos 
- - Oh shit . That confused me . Thanks guys
  - Use the osbuddy tracker  way easier 
- - Can anyone fine that blue light thread that some meth addict wrote  It was super detailed and written really unorthodox .
  - I think we ll need way more to narrow it down .
- - What  Did nt remember that ... How 
  - The silver hand Voldemort gave him strangled him when he hesitated to kill Harry Potter in the cellar .
- - Muhammed is much  much for important than Jesus in Islam
  - But they re both prophets  right
