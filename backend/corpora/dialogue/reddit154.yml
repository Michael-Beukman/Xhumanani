  - There s plenty of mountains like this . At some point a human chose to clear trees from one and not the other . I m wondering about those finer points .
- - you have NO idea how happy it makes me to see them play this . I thought these days were over .
  - They actually played it on every single date of their recent shows in the UK with Curtis Ward .
- - That first one is really close  I sent it to her . Thank you 
  - No problem you could order one at first to inspect the quality 
- - MATT ELAM WITH AN INTERCEPTION    ELITE . AS FUK
  - Maybe he s got Flacco s playoff special water .
- - Was the goalie crease everything everyone says it is 
  - Yes  always try to make it there when I visit the GTA .
- - Wait  how old is this imam  What if you refused ...
  - If I refused my parents would probably have punished me for not listening to an Imam . xD
- - I ca nt believe I read that entire thing .
  - Imagine how I feel about writing it .
- - I would assume they were scamming me . Trying to get a more expensive meal for cheaper .
  - Chicken and beans are a hell of a lot cheaper than salmon and cheese

  - you re welcome  glad to do it 
- - Does nt matter bc Karma is leaving My wild prediction for ON s Champs roster - Swanny Proof Enable Replays

- - I come by way of Dallas so I get your drift . I apologize for being a prick . peace .
  - So you ve been misunderstanding me on purpose this whole time  la
- - I worked at a place where we would put items on a pallet when it was nt needed just to get rid of the shitty pallet .

  - Well yeah  that s kind of the point  certain skills go hand in hand .
- - the only person claiming we were interested in JJ was JJ s agent  odd that huh

- - I guess I do nt visit this sub enough because I have no idea what s going on .
  - It has nothing to do with poe  so you re not missing out on anything .
- - Really  Wikipedia . you want me to site real sources saying that there is no proof except for in the bible 
  - You do realize that wikipedia has perfectly reliable sources  Click on all the different sources .
- - Real names I ve come across in life . Richard Head  and my favorite Suk Mei Dong .
  - Is Richard Head by any chance a doctor 
- - Those are facts and inference  not opinions .
  - opinions though are inherently biased  that is the point .
- - I ca nt recall Chelsea fans ever turning on him which as a neutral seems staggering but in a good way . Staggeringly warm hearted .
  - The guy worked his hardest and you could tell how frustrating it was for him . Hard to root against that person .

- - These pics do nt appear to be from the same perspective .
  - Its not quite the same perspective but a close angle and a lot of the buildings are still there
- - Yes  when in doubt blame women and young people . Salaryman confirmed 
  - So it s up to the elderly to keep reproducing

  - He just does nt have the competition to push him into deep waters .
- - Had to reupload that one  sound issues now ok  but still not perfect ...
  - I do nt get any sound at all .
- - I do nt need meaning . Trying to force a meaning on life is depressing . There is nt a definite meaning in my opinion .
  - So youre saying that without God there is no way to give your own life meaning without becoming depressed 
- - Married with kids ... Next to impossible to have the kind of young experiences I was thinking about .
  - I see . I m curious though  what kind of experiences 
- - Haha no worries I ll get off my ass and measure mine . Thanks
