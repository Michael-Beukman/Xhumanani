  - I typed that wrong ... it has ads but you never have to click them away . I meant it plays non-stop with no interaction and you earn points .

  - I d love to see RedLetterMedia take on the Hobbit trilogy .

  - I mean  they were average and kind of forgettable  which is sad given what came before . But they were nowhere near Star Wars prequels bad .
- - I m always here  Nice to see more bronies around  XD

  - I hate playing against someone with him ... He causes all sorts of problems
- - I m sure Islam s penalty of death for blasphemy is just a conspiracy to instill hatred against Muslims . Right .
  - Islam has a death penalty for Apostasy  not for Blasphemy . Not very nice either  but a VERY big difference .
- - The crazies are out in force today  Happy NY everyone 
  - I think there must have been a new year amnesty and they let them all out
- - I m pretty sure you ca nt turn it off for My Career Mode .
  - Best option for playing around it is to max out your stamina recovery ASAP . It does nt solve the issue completely but it will help a lot .
- - Played Kelthuzad for the body as a followup to my Doomsayer clearing the board . Ended up reviving the Doomsayer again following the end of the turn and threw the game .
  - Makes sense  doomsayer dies at the beginning of the new turn  not at the end of the previous one .
- - Well put . I ll have to take some time and consider your point of view .
  - Thanks . I recommend Spaceballs as warm-up to it .
- - Sheamus and Bryan do have great matches though
  - Oh no doubt  Bryan is one of Sheamus  best opponents  but I do nt think it s the match up either of them deserve at Wrestlemania
- - Relax . He might be pro  but he can never have the unlimited patience you do to lead the completely new players in the right direction . Thanks a bunch .
  - Why is Warowl limited to just new players  If pro players help with those vids then there is nothing wrong with Warowl trying to branch into higher level of play .
  - I do nt think he should expand into higher level play . He has filled a good niche teaching Silvers .
  - Even a lot of gold novas learn from him 
- - Starvation will take a while  just burn them .
  - And have molten fat dripping everywhere  Plus imagine the stench .
- - fuckin right  scare yourself yet  haha
  - Oh  not yet  not very far in .
- - also wonder if we would ever see a Heavenly Sword port to PC as well 
  - Now thats a game I want to play .

- - Oh  are you red haired up there 
  - Nope  just boring old brown hair sorry

  - Check the local tavern if they sell . A lot of that list you have to get through gathering and sending your workers to farm stuff
- - Wow blatant PI . That flag came in so late I nearly pooped myself in rage .
  - I was upset thinking there would be an offset .
- - This from a guy whose last good album was Cocky .
  - Kid Rock had a good album  Are you sure you were nt thinking of someone completely unrelated to him 
- - Impressive  but it does nt look like you get a lot of juice out of a kick like that
  - He mentions points  I guess it s useful in a tournament where contacting the head is important .

  - The movie industry wo nt simply provide the audio tracks for this to happen .
- - But would nt plug.dj do exactly what you want to do without the need for anyone to stream anything
  - I guess  I ve never used plug.dj before but I want everyone to be involved
- - That s weird . I do nt recall receiving this warning . Maybe it has something to do with Adblock 
  - No  I have AdBlock and it is a banner that will not be blocked .
- - Just out of curiosity  what made you choose Reddcoin 
  - I am so optimistic about it . I am investing in the future even more .
- - Cesaro and RVD sounds like a dream match on paper but most of the times they ve faced off in WWE it has been sort of awkward and sloppy

  - good idea  I ll add that to my features list
- - You do nt get it  Mr. Murican . Literally dips . There s a sauce on your pants . What do you think I was suggesting  O.o
  - Well I was talking about baseball  not that you would understand that . You know  the great Merican pass time .
  - What  Why would I be jealous of obesity incarnate  I prefer other meat  thank you very much .
  - We probably do that better too . All you ve got is cheese  which is pretty much just old milk .
- - I m pretty sure he is the voice of the Dj in reservoir dogs and the guy on the couch in half baked
  - Ca nt confirm DJ but yes to couch guy in Half Baked

- - I think the hidden just wait ending is the most easy to live with .
  - Yeah that one was nice . Caused no destruction  did nt have to make any tough choices . Blissful ignorance .
- - I would nt say that anything steel cased is corrosive but i must agree with the fact of being cautious since we all play plenty for our collections
  - I m not saying for certain all steel cased is corrosive just saying the majority is and all of it might as well be treated as such .
- - It really bothers me that Tim Allen and Alan Rickman s names arent underneath their respective pictures .
  - Happens so often and always bugs me too

  - Sure - just updated the original post .

- - The real question . Did she continue to date Jeff 
  - She did see him for a short while after that but it fell apart pretty quickly .
- - So why is nt he banned  I always thought novelty accounts were banned as the sidebar says 
  - I guess it is nt so much a novelty account as it is satire .
- - Tony Parker has his tear drop floater to finish drives into the paint .
  - And Parker has the ability to finish on either side of the rim with his right hand . Something Jennings lacks .

- - Congrats mate . Glad to hear it s changed your life for the better . At least you were nt bullied for it growing up like I was .
  - thanks . sorry to hear that you were bullied badly for it
- - Good thinking movie studios . Way to push countless people to unsubscribe from Netflix and go back to pirating .
  - Given how vocal Netflix has been in the fight for more rational media services  that first result sounds like a good outcome for the MPAA .
- - Sweet  Is that writing on the obverse 
  - Nope . Just scratches from being in my pocket .
- - Please back up your claim with proof . I mean you did nt just pull this put of your ass  right 
  - He meant to say Of course  . Why do nt you backup your requirement for proof with proof .
- - I guess I was nt the only one taking something . Henderson and especially Bisping beating Vitor is preposterous .
  - Yeah  I do nt know what that guy is talking about .
- - This is stupid . There are mental and physical benefits to working out .
  - Well  you d think at least the gym would nt have to pay a light bill . All of that human energy goes to waste .
- - I think they have already managed to make the BR and the DMR look like generic weapons of todays shooters with the scope attachments .

- - Work for it how  Edit . Read a Times article about this . Basically maintain good grades .
  - By voting for democrats I am pretty sure .

  - oh god  they are going to do this to avoid the batista melt down post rumble
- - What is the temperature outside where you are at  From what I can see that pony has good amount of fur and probably does nt need that blanket on .
  - Where I love it s almost freezing point  and we are always rainy and foggy  so he needed it . P

  - Well  how about I paint your finger nails
