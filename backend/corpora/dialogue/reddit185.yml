  - Solo queue has less than zero communication . So that will literally never happen .
  - So communicate . Do nt perpetuate the stereotype .

  - I was thinking the exact same thing ... Are you me 
- - None of their players really stand out as a great captain although Henderson s probably their best bet . He s hardly someone you ll be scared of coming up against though
  - Skrtel on the other hand ... i would be scared shitless .

  - RIGHT   If they re not in the current installment of a story  they do nt need to be introduced

  - None of it counts . That is why I m allowed to Ignore swtor and Revan .
- - It s following a similar course to the seasons of The Wire .

  - Thank you for listening and for your comment . I am sorry to hear about your situation and I hope things get better for you and your loved one .
- - To be fair about it consumers should be able to charge them with assault for making someone listen to shitty music .
  - You do nt get to define quality of our music . Pay up .
- - All I can think of is the next giant storm or wave is gon na clean that rock right off .
  - Because lakes are known for their tsunamis .

  - That s what I get for uploading around midnight . UK has been added 
- - Ejection for a punch anyone  ... Glad they did nt though
  - Two hard hitting teams who hate each other in a playoff game  I say let it slide it makes it more fun to watch em get chippy .
- - I can do this too  I m curious  do you play any musical instruments

  - He does nt need to know how to use haki to withstand Luffy s conqueror s haki .

  - Whats kid Icarus uprising play like  i tried watching some youtube videos and dont  think i understand what i m looking at .
- - Oh yeah one is obviously worse than the other I was just commenting on the intensity .
  - Absolutely . I was commenting on how being so mad about fat people just confuses me  like they re some all powerful class that secretly run the world .
- - I read it but it s worded in an extremely confusing way . Forget that I even bothered . Have a good day .
  - Did you read the specific rule that was linked to for examples on how to do it  I do nt understand what s so confusing .
- - Do nt you need at least your ID and some cash to pay for parking  ferry tickets  tips  random expenses that come up 
  - For a walk in the park I can see people leaving their wallet behind  as they do not need cash for walking .
- - Hey guy  just try not to be scum yourself . You re failing right now .
  - You have to get in the gutter if you want to deal with Muslims .
- - Get into a prestigious college and not a State School .
  - Somewhere in that alternate time line you made it to today and you re saying to yourself that you should have gone to community college to save the money .
- - Or do some version of it with Oliver since he also only really has a domino mask and a hood .
  - And it s always dark when he s around . I d like to see him going out in the day more often  causing him to get a better mask .

  - I m pretty much convinced Misha has a stomach made of steel after watching him eat it at the end of all three so far . Lol .
- - He will also need to start firing lasers .
  - Why should we trust you  You are after all a lying cake .
- - The pictures are still there . I blocked him and have unfollowed his friends and family .
  - What s the difference between blocking and unfollowing 
- - It was meant as a joke  its pretty obvious that I should nt repeat any of it without any official study
  - sorry hard for me to tell sarcastic comments  but you would nt believe how many people have tried to speak Japanese to me from just watching anime
- - Why would you trade in a game that you played and had fun with every day 
  - I felt like I had done everything that the game had to offer .
- - Both Giroud and Welbeck just did nt do anything for me .

- - It s quite clear that TCU is significantly better . Is it not 
  - Well  now it is obvious . Are trying to use retrospect as a requisite for making the playoffs 
- - I agree with your point  but I question the IP protection . Did nt a judge withdraw IP protection from the WA Redskins because of this 
  - I meant that you do nt get protection . For example  you do nt have to pay royalties or request usage for a parody song .
- - It is nt Finnish . It is nt anything .
  - Well its got ta be something Jerry .
- - Also  since the tragic goxxing I hear that there is a large OTC market that developed  so these purchases do nt affect the exchange price .
  - I ve wondered about this but have nt heard much  any sources 
- - Hmm ... well I had a dream a few nights ago in which I was feeding my earwax to my dog . So that was pretty odd .
  - Freud would have a ball coming up with an explanation for that

  - Sadly  ca nt find it . I tried both Arabic and English searches .
- - Geeze  why do nt they just make you use an abacus and wear green visors while they re at it
  - What was the purpose of the green visors  I always see them as jokes  but do nt know the deal behind them .
- - Pretty sure Dick Lebeau is older than dirt
  - Dirt doesnt take that long to form  so its possible
- - Metro series are really atmospheric  really dark and grim  they do a great job of passing the feeling of dread and despair they are trying to pass .
  - Forgot to mention those in my playlist . It s one of my favorite game series .
- - We re a world class city too ...
  - But if you ask a Londoner where it is  they have no idea without a map .
- - I ve never heard it referred to as that  but in my jurisdiction they call it filing a grievance against an attorney .

- - Amul s really milking the situation . Is nt it 
  - They know how to butter up their approval .
- - My wife s reaction to hearing me watch this was amusing .
  - Did the same after reading your comment  she was not amused haha .
- - I should ve known  my cat was meowing at my closet yesterday and I told him to get lost .
  - And I ate your cat . I m sorry .
- - So anyone heading to any games for the Asian Cup 
  - Yeah  UAE vs Qatar for shits and giggles .

  - no  but the rule is specifically against American domestic news  not Indian domestic news  because then the American news would drown out non-American news due to its volume .
- - thanks   looks delicious  and that goes with yogurt rice 
  - Yes you do  It s tasty 
- - Would you ban all doctors from the country because of Harold Shipman 
  - Nope  just like I would nt criticise people of being wary of doctors because of him .
- - man Therrien really loves that Beau - Gonchar pairing
  - Gonchar s been good this period  I thought .
  - I agree  I was nt complaining  I m stoked that Beaulieu is getting some legit minutes
  - I was happy to see him on the PP . Ca nt wait for him to score his first goal of his career
- - So  it serves the same purpose as firefox sync kinda 
  - Does nt Firefox Sync just do what Chrome does with bookmark and browser settings syncing  I ve never heard of Firefox doing what Pushbullet does natively .
- - Imagine how different the comments on this thread would be if it was Shane Watson instead of Steve Smith that dropped these two catches LOL .
  - It will be different because Shane Watson is not the leading run scorer in the series . Not by a long stretch .
- - Looks good  but it starts to chip away and looks really ugly after that . It s a real eye sore .
  - Okay  I ll keep that in mind  thanks

  - Ok especially after seeing that it was from the night before  you have absolutely nothing to worry about dude  Chances are she wo nt even notice it
  - Okay that makes me feel better . It never occurred to me before how much worse it would be if it was old
- - Where might one find such an stl file  Asking for a friend .
  - I found it on thingiverse but could try and pm it to you later or something if you ca nt find it
- - It was either that or he quits so I guess we had to do what we had to do
  - Yeah  threatening to bounce if not given total power nor in line with your contract . When players do this they are selfish children .
  - To be fair I think he was told he d be in charge of everything when he was hired only to find out he was nt really .
  - So he threatened the team and forced them to renegotiate his contract . And when players do this 
- - Del did nt kill him  he just broke his hands .
  - Del killed him and made it look like suicide . I thought that was pretty obvious ...
- - So what is going on with the Panthers this game  They have no business being down . Is it coaching  What is it 
  - They are a bad team who just happened to get into the playoffs vs a good team with QB problems .

  - As would the Palestinians . Whole place is fucked .
- - Damn  breaking a toilet ... Shattered porcelain does nt play .
  - Luckily he was alright  a little scratched up but fine .
- - Public service announcement . staying in a relationship out of guilt is nt a good idea  On the flipside  remember that you deserve someone who loves and needs you 
  - All hail Kat  bearer of fantastic comics and beautiful life lessons .

  - Yep thanks that was it  swapped for two normals with an awesome guy . All working . Thanks

- - Running despair on my tyron  think I d prefer that over violent .
  - Yeah  they re for two different roles
- - Sanchez would have solved our right midfield problem .

  - The FA Cup is important . You just have to think practically .
- - A touch heavy on the distortion . try playing like you re trying to break the strings ; that s what I notice when watching videos of SRV
  - True  yeah I was plugged directly into the computer I agree on the tone .
- - exploration makes money soley off of selling items  how does it generate new isk at all 
  - I thought you were wrong for a second before realizing only things like missions and rat bounties actually generate new ISK .
- - Well TIL one of my favorite all time musicians is a POS as a human being . Greatly disappointing .
  - He does nt share my views  therefore he s a POS

  - I ll make sure I m more faded then your flair .
- - Gee  wonder why they picked a Kosher store .
  - I wonder if this was not planned ahead . Kosher markets are not that common .
- - Yeah I m getting the same with accessing my inventory in general .
  - Ye but steam is up so not sure why its happening .
- - I m at the ground  ca nt believe there s so many people here . A proud day for football .
  - How good is this stadium  Better than Etihad .
- - Do it everywhere  anywhere and anyway you can think of and beg for forgiveness later .
  - YES  We re both pretty excited about this  . D
- - They re pretty darn tasty roasted too with a bit of olive oil  salt  and pepper .
  - Humm  now that I m into them  that sounds enticing .

- - I might have just fell in love with this girl .
  - No  I m in love with her 
- - What s he gon na do when he learns of the various lolicon accounts on Twitter 
  - Conveniently ignore them . The same way they conveniently ignore the pedos in their own ranks . Or even actively support them .
- - It s more plausible than taking it off  if it s a frozen pizza - it s usually on there pretty good .
  - Can confirm they are stuck on there pretty hard
- - Does that windshield banner come with any benefits other than making your very attractive car look like a twat

- - If you get the flu you use up like one week at once .
  - Not sure that I m going to go out of my way to get the flu .
- - I liked most of it except for the thing about Fred Phelps . Simply the death of a hate monger alone is nt really a victory IMHO .
  - Thanks  There are plenty of people who feel as you do . I suppose it s all a matter of personal opinion .
- - Poor dog . Dumb reason to shave a HUSKY .
  - I do nt think death is a dumb reason .
- - How do you guys figure that they have enough money to complete the game right now  I do nt see that they have even half of what they need 
  - Sliding scale . They plan for new features with the projected income increase .
- - Is that motherfuckin mayonnaise under all that shit  Cuz if it is ... Oh no you did not .
  - Nah  man . That s white American cheese because it s all my fiance will eat .
- - You know you could actually have a little fun with physics in circular motion and attempt to calculate the figures needed and at the same time teach 
  - Or you could not be boring and throw cars down the wall
- - I wonder if Beyonc gets paid for this
  - covers typically fall under fair use  IIRC  but because it s a full band arrangement they probably had to pay for the sheet music
- - Saying that an attitude is idiotic is not the same as calling someone an idiot .
  - Not directly  but it implies the person is an idiot for having that attitude .
- - I ca nt look at that . What is it referencing 
  - Bullet defying boobs in High School of the Dead .

  - Ahh ok I gotcha . Unfortunately in that case I do nt know what the problem could be .
- - Driving a CTS-V up stairs seems unwise . They re your cars  though .

  - Well it s not that I dislike the white but I think it will look boring .
- - It can be from over watering the plants also fertilizers can mess with Oregano .
  - Not using any fertilizers . I wondered about watering . I suppose if we cut back and disaster ensues - we ll know that was nt the problem  right 
- - Staples and Marrow ... sounds like a good name for a band .
  - Woah woah ... marrow gets top billing in the band and the biggest cut of the tickets at the door .
- - I keep checking my email to see if I got rematched .
  - Same but I guess it has nt taken place as of yet
- - Only after a patch  which I do not have .
  - Ahh . I see where the confusion comes from .
- - He ll be lucky to not break his neck .
  - Could possibly be wearing a neck brace under his helmet
- - it s ok it s only preseason . Try quitting ranked for a bit  have some fun in normals
  - I already tried that  did nt seem to help much  lost most of my normals that I played too . P

  - It s quite thick because of the cables . D
- - I just find so many things about Oklahoma football overrated
  - This year  I would say yes . But as an overall program we are very successful .
- - That s awesome  I decided to take a year off from serious relationships  but then I see posts like this that make me want to change my mind .
  - Yeah  I ve taken nearly three years to figure myself out since my last relationship  finally finding the true me about a year ago .
- - I still do not intend on supporting them . Alot of these sites have an extremely long way to go .
  - And what would you like to see before you support them  Would you like them to apologize about what they said  because I seriously doubt that ll happen .

  - And that is the difference between the two .
- - The last Batman game was shit and was not developed by the same people that did Arkham asylum and city . That original team is developing Arkham knight .

- - Wow  that is really closed minded and insulting .
  - I was trying to convey joy and fun  you guys are way too serious about an example of a creative way to overcome change . You all need to chill lol
- - Imagine them creating the constitution then suddenly realizing no one is eligible to become president .
  - Sounds like an Article of Confederation kinda thing to do .
- - Nice  Do you mind explaining why  Is it because of the sunsinger with radiance

  - You mean like with this job skills training program  Did you read the article 
- - looks awsome  decent rolls  but there are better helms  inmost light iss the best for pvp imo

- - I have common social skills  I think I know whether or not what I say is insensitive .
  - Clearly not  otherwise you would nt be posting this in the first place .

- - I agree that this is important . I just ca nt connect the dots .
  - Yup  same . We know this sub is in on it somehow ... but that s about it .

- - As a big touhou fan  I d defenitely play it  but there is no way thats going to be coming to eshop
  - If Meme Run can be a game you can buy from the eshop then anything can make it in the eshop
