  - No  The picture quality has to match the game quality .
- - Gina after a long walk in the snow . Stupid phone .

  - Actually you do nt have a sense of humor .
- - Be prepared to possibly go to grad school in order to get a job in those fields .

  - This Could Be Us has been on constant rotation since the album came out .
- - Sold . Also  how do U.S. China relations look now 
  - Probably what U.S. - Canada relations look right now .
- - This is somewhat nonsensical in context  there s no possible explanation here that does nt involve shilling .
  - I suppose ; not the right thread to voice concerns about shilling when shilling is what is apparently going on in that post .
- - You re full of shit  OP . On your other thread  which you deleted  you claimed that he had already been picked up .
  - Yah that s why I thought . So I edited it to say waiting for him to get picked up . Sorry

  - Thank you  trying to follow a good example and chip in .
- - Can confirm . I d rather someone be honest and genuine rather than sugarcoat everything .
  - right . I was talking more about Fe  but Fi and kindness are interesting . Fi may think that kindness is good but will still prefer sincerity when challenged .
- - That s exactly what I do . Non stop stimulation until I crash  usually to be awoken a few hours later by my good friend T .
  - White noise really helps me . If you can tune it correctly it will make it go away  lucky for me the sound is drowned out easily by the ocean .

  - Lol  I was about to say .

  - Yes . Notice how one kiwi hangs lower than the other 
- - has anyone explained why the ropes are in a few meters

- - Had him wide open and no pressure . Calm down Marcus .
  - not for another half quarter  I bet .
- - Joffery is on a whole other level when it comes to being a sadist . Draco could not kill Dumbledore . He has some conscience
  - Joffrey would kill dumbledore and hang his naked corpse over the tables
- - Prices are unlikely to go down because of Ontario s puritan laws that establish minimum pricing for alcoholic beverages .
  - I believe those taxes are to offset costs to the government from the consumption of alcohol . Health costs  policing costs  etc . etc . etc .
- - Lamps of fertility use herba . Maybe try a jar of herba

- - That s fair . It s not an rpg in anywhere bear the same aspect  it s true . I meant story wise etc it s similar .
  - Yeah story wise it is the same . I actually like how we see the sith and none force user stories .
  - Same  I love the bounty hunter storyline .

  - the receiver ran the wrong route on that one
- - tbh that pixel art was really cool .
  - I m pretty sure it s supposed to be Iron bull from dragon age inquisition ... which is only a few months olds .
- - Do nt you dare knock lunchables . If they cam with beer you would still eat those things and you know it .
  - That d be the best . Those little ham and cheese sandwiches with crackers instead of bread . And a cold beer
- - They re girls on this seasons The Bachelor which premiered tonight ...
  - I got roped into watching this with my sisters . Savage has good taste .

- - I really hope they find a cure for Recently
  - Recently has killed many people in my family . Do not downplay its importance with shitty pictures .
- - I thought Republicans were supposed to love freedom
  - Whatever a Republican says  the opposite is probably true .
- - The glass glows because uranium is fluorescent . Uranium is also radioactive  but that s not what s causing the glow .
  - How so  Does nt the fluorescent part require radioactivity to produce photons 
- - Do you get any lag using the quick switcher  Is pretty bad for me .
  - I do sometimes experience a slight delay in activating the Quick Switcher  but the animations themselves are pretty fluid for me .

- - I know it s horrible . I ve been a lurker for far too long  just now starting to crawl out of my shell .
  - Awesome . Basically do nt worry about the karma and browse new threads . You have kik 
- - Are the uniforms black or navy  Navy blue is a very dark blue that looks almost black .
  - Some are black  some are dark navy . Both are fairly intimidating .
- - There are dozens of sites judging Harper as a coward . Trudeau knew exactly what he was saying .
  - Maybe  maybe not . It s general enough that either could be right . Which was the point  the article is a stretch .
  - What  You do nt believe that left wing bloggers are making the PM out to be a coward in this 
  - Definitely . And the NP editorial board can write something about them without having to stretch so hard .
- - If you re a vet then why did nt you buy IB or G-horn the first time around

  - So  Lots of people thought piss christ was in poor taste too . No one shot the artist .
- - I ve heard a bit about this and am definitely considering . You ve done it often then 
  - Quite often  Its a really  really great way to get started with meditation  or to reliably induce the relaxation response .
- - WWE needs solid competition  when you are the only big Brand in the USA  it can produce any product and still survive
  - Hopefully GFW can fill that void . But I doubt it .
- - I like it a lot . And that bullitt green is perfect on all generations .
  - Thanks  Funny  I bought it and now will probably ask to be buried in it one day
- - That spartan helmet is more evidence of the Halo movie that got sadly cancelled
  - Or that could still be in the works  stay optimistic son

  - Unfortunately I am not located in the states .
- - It s deeply unsettling that people like you actually exist .
  - Judging by the username I m pretty sure somebody made a troll account to make Rutgers look bad . Why they re so dedicated is beyond me .
- - I would love to see a pirate faction ship with the perk of dropping off overview in dense asteroid belts untill a certain range
  - That s brilliant . Make it undetectable on d scan while its in an asteroid field or gas cloud too .
  - To balance it though  you d have to make it so you ca nt dscan the rest of the system out from them either .
  - Why not just not balance it  There are other places to hunt . Or just make it require a high slot module .
  - If you want to make it require a module  hint  that already exists  in the form of a deployable d-scan blocker .

- - It sounds kind of like Google Drive . It lets you create a collaborative drawing board that kind of reminded me of MS paint .
  - OOOOOooo  I did nt notice the Google Drawings before  I just associated drive with word processing  spreadsheets  powerpoint This looks like it might be exactly perfect  thanks
- - What are you using to connect the Firefly to the glass 
  - Ordinary silicone whip tubing - also the best way to connect a Pax to a water pipe .

  - Oh that makes me want to throw up .
- - Wow that is sick . Which smart watch is this 
  - It s the original Samsung Galaxy Gear .
- - We never landed on the moon because there is no moon 
  - Plot twist . We all live on the moon . In a yellow submarine .
- - My strengths include anticipating future demands  as you can see I applied for this position a year in advance .
  - I might use this if I miraculously still get a call for an interview .
- - Anyone reading this comment should take cpr lessons and not go off of what was said above .
  - Well of course ... but did I say something wrong specifically

- - i mean i think one is the proper way to say it and one is the idiot way to say it .
  - you sound like a fun guy to be around

- - The kid in the back is carrying on the unibrow nicely .
  - came here for unibrow comments . was not disappoint . also  good for them 
- - Is it me or is grandma try to hit that 
  - The bud  or hipster Ryan Seacrest 
- - I have literally no interest in engaging someone as full of shit as you are .
  - I asked you legitimate questions . You ca nt answer them  ISIS is incredibly fascist . How can you seriously defend them 
- - i would be pissed about all the RP spent on the account lol
  - He said if his main would have been banned he would be a little upset but he would still just make a new account .
- - Did nt get anything on EUNE or EW yet .

  - Pretty safe bet . And if he gets moved  its reasonable to assume they are getting something pretty shiny in return .
- - I m fucking terrified now  if the refs act like this against the Packers there s going to be riots .
  - Would nt be too worried . Refs at home in Lambeau are generally pretty Pack favorable .
- - Nice ideas  but I do nt get the first point of the glue . Does it do damage while it stays on the enemy  or slow them down 
  - It does damage  sorry  I ll add it to the post .

  - It is from his first autobiography What s it all about   The best autobiography I ve ever read  would recommend it
- - I m wearing jeans for too long without washing .
  - You are far from the worse in this thread .
- - What if in an alternate universe smoking weed smelled like febreeze and we had candles like these
  - plants pollute the air and cars blow oxygen out of their exhaust .
- - the guy in the front row looks like he s about to throw up
  - He s having an allergic reaction . But look at how cute that cute that dog is on a plane .
- - Nice  is there one of those floating around for Ult comms 
  - No  Miner only made this one . He might make one for ultimates if people ask .
- - You ca nt what  Are you disagreeing with me or not  I m confused .
  - you cant use them for all the tamers  but yes you can use them for most . some fights you need alternative counters .
- - Its kinda cool idea but what im really missing is the patches . We are still playing release version atleast in EU . Also the could fix the trophy glitches aswell .
  - Yeah . Any patch at this point would be nice .

- - I do nt think I get it . Help 
  - They are getting an engagement ring to be best friends . Imagine if your bff was official .
- - Oh man I would love to see that . Maybe an episode of Archer where he becomes a soccer coach .
  - They ve already done the Bobs Burgers crossover . It only makes sense for them to do this .
  - Unfortunately it d probably be too much of a leap for Archer to become a sarcastic Cerberus that lives in a necromancer s daughter s closet .
  - If he can be a raptor  he can be anything .
- - why are people who have no idea about it the ones who are voting on it 
  - because the people who have no idea or do nt care about it voted them into office
- - OOH  inspired by you  I went and tried and got my first feed too  YAY 
  - ahh congrats  Just curious  what was the food  if you remember 
- - I smoke weed like there s no tomorrow

  - Hey  it only took us an hour and a half to kill it  so that s a win in my book .
- - It s delicious to serve curry over roasted potatoes
  - Or to stew them in the curry for a while so they suck up some of the deliciousness . This is really good in a Japanese style curry
- - Agreed but there s a difference between a post up under the basket and a post up around the free throw line which is quintessential Jordan and Kobe .
  - Sometimes you have someone so good a bad shot is a good shot .
- - imagine if they had picked up Illidan or Ditya Ra . Now they barely have the name power to really attract some big name muscle .
  - remove goblak and xboct  replace them with Illidan and fng . Navi immediately a more threatening team .

- - This season was the best thing Tim and Eric have ever done .
  - Agree to disagree . I love the Awesome Show .
- - love it overall  but personally not a fan of being able to clearly hear a lisp in a rap

- - Reminds me of Miss Fortune from League of Legends .
  - She has a skin based on Jessica Rabbit  kind of .
- - I find it hard to believe that Microsoft wants to be in this market .
  - I do nt think Microsoft actually knows what market it wants to be in .
- - I like how you wrote edit  but actually replied for double the silky sweet karma .
  - That s some pro strats right there .
- - Little known fact . the cold war is the reason we created heat seeking missiles . Now we ve found too much heat .
  - But they have nt found me yet . They must not be that good .
- - Maybe you should do the Tourney once the structure becomes TCG legal  basically best of both worlds right there .
  - Yeah  that s what I was thinking . We do nt know all the cards in it yet also .
- - Why do we always have to make it close
  - The safety really does nt change anything though  you guy will still win this .
- - The guy is exceptional in coverage  my only knock is his tackling .
  - He seemed better at it this year . No huge kam chancellor hits  but he had a few where you had to ask yourself if that was really DRC
- - Honestly I expect Nashville to be in the WCF .
  - idk i kinda still think they may not make the playoffs . I feel if they have a bad injury they are nt deep enough to maintain themselves .
- - SUPER COOL  And MUNCHKIN  I love that game 
  - Thank you  And Munchkin is FAB  I got it for Christmas 
- - Gah . These are nice . Regret jumping on Daltons when I was newer to the game .

- - It looks pretty nice now . Just tidy it up a bit . This is unrelated but you re one handsome dude .
  - Ah thanks dude I appreciate it . I feel like I had huge dark circles under my eyes haha
- - So by your metric Jimmy Butler would be a terrible player who would amount to nothing but riding the bench .
  - To be fair  Jimmy Butler is nt a superstar
- - Dubs treating Val like he s Shaq .
  - It s how we treat every big ever since we lost our centers . D-Mo  Gasol  Val  seriously .
- - I never knew that front end was so ugly ...
  - Idk about had haha very aggressive . Especially in person .
- - A Million Ways To Die In The West . Awful .

- - And lets be completely honest a little dumbed down
  - I have no idea tbh  I ve never played LoL .

  - Nope . Apps do nt have the same level of interaction on iOS as they do on Android .
- - Are servers supposed to be stable because i cant log in .
  - Servers are fine for me . . s
- - Ca nt be mad about this game  rockets would of blew them out if the FT disparity was within reason . At least the effort is there now .
  - I do nt think anybody in the league has the ability to blowout the bulls .

- - How long are you able to be online today  I m currently writing down the Pokemons that I m looking for the most
  - I m staying up all night . Just shoot me .
- - Correlation does not mean causation . This guy failed at critical thinking . Chances are this guy will not do well in STEM  and probably in life too .
  - He s posting in TRP . I d say that s pretty much a slam dunk .
- - Is the blade spinning the right way 
  - The blade cuts from the bottom up . Which according to the arrows should be correct .
- - Good point . I guess since the voting is online their audience is worldwide .
  - yea plus he s playing with kobe  who is very popular in china .
- - I love being controlled . It makes me feel settled  peaceful . If I am pleasing my dom  I am ... Blissful . Fulfilled .
  - I guess om the opposite  i like being in control  i just dont know why
- - How is he lacking in masculinity  Theres nothing feminine about him .
  - maybe it s the lack of facial hair or something . that s the only explanation i can think of .
- - Is that such a bad thing  The fact of renting is nt the issue  it s the cost of renting .
  - Not at all ; but the UK has this crazy I must own a house in order to be successful  culture .
- - Online privacy . Until it affects me I guess .
  - Private trackers  bro . Do nt use that publicly sourced stuff .
- - I would love  love  love to see the results of a Louis Gohmert speakership .
  - Some men just want to watch the world burn .
- - Philadelphia Eagles mascot . I had to look up the name because I could nt believe that it shared the name with Eastern Michigan University s mascot .
  - There are a lot of bird mascots named Swoop  apparently .
- - Yes  of course the shareholders care . But shareholders and owners are a very different group .
  - You just asked why anyone in NA would care what phones the Chinese use  and I ve told you one group .
- - i m surprised they used one of Kessel s nicer pictures
  - Good one of kessel and crap one of dion .
- - Ah yes  the poke of other hard engage supports is so strong . I m getting poked out of lane by Leona and Blitz all the time .
  - So his poke is good because it s not as bad as leona and blitzcrank 
  - He s a hard engage support without the fundamental weakness of hard engage supports . no poke .
  - But Leona s hard engage is better  hence she has no poke . Thresh s hard engage is decent but he has a bit of poke
- - Not sure why i bought the compendium this trade lock is complete bullshit .
  - use gift wrap . then u can trade it

  - Was this a joke  Surely this is a joke  No one can be that stupid .
- - If you really need me to show you how Dolan is totally not Catholic then I have nothing more to say to you . Thanks .
  - If you ca nt cite your work  there s not really much benefit in talking to you  or believing anything you write . Thanks .
- - Please do nt beg . I m sure EVERYONE here can use spare trading cards .
  - Not really begging . Just asking if anyone wants to get rid of them .
- - Nice  I like the purple theme 
  - Thanks been working on it for quite some time .
- - Once you form Netherlands all your french region provinces flip to France so your best course of action is to vassalize them and integrate them after you form the Netherlands .
  - no longer works . vassals surrender their land to france if they are in the french region
- - Yeah but by law the money needs to be usable by blind people and that s pretty much impossible right now since all notes have the same size ...
  - I was unaware of this . What law are you referring to 
- - Awesome  I m definitely in  pending the results of more fountain pen test results .
  - Great  I ll let ya know when it s in .

- - I want Milner . I do nt know how likely that would be though . There were rumours of him leaving Man C
  - Where would we play him  Anywhere and everywhere 
- - Oh really  Who was this study done by  Let me guess an AMERICAN FUCKING COMPANY .
  - Most of the world acknowledges US superiority in higher education . You re just exceptionally stupid  perhaps due to the fact .

  - You re very welcome  glad you like it 
- - Well  I could give you a real problem to solve . Would that help 
  - I second this  find a problem to solve . Set up a personal site using Codepen or Jsfiddle as a staging area is one idea .
- - I d love arma gold edition . Thank you and happy new year 
  - I got it  Nice  Happy New Year  So happy 
- - But DC has a few companies making figures  not just one . I do nt see how that would be any different .
  - I think it has something to do with Lego only having the building block license and not the action figure license . I do nt know the specifics of it though .
- - Make sure to make good use of space .
  - Yes this  Too many tracks have so much stuff going on that the overall vibe gets muddled . The best songs come from blissful simplicity
- - So I rolled tridon . Will they ever release the dungeon again so that I can get his six star now that the bulbs are every friday 
  - They ll likely release the dungeon again . But we know nothing because Gumi has told us nothing .

  - I got it as a balance druid by whacking rats in Naxx with my caster fist weapon between pulls .
- - You should have looked into the console more before you bought it .
  - I looked into it plenty . I just wanted some insider perspective .
- - This is why there should be legalized fight clubs .
  - Being legal totally negates the need for it
- - Because the alternative of leaving the kid with drug-addicted parents is sooo much better .
  - it is . children that grow up in foster care are the highest demographic for suicide  drug abuse  and homelessness .
- - Empty only uses your graveyard . This card can target the opponent s graveyard .
  - Good point . Altar of the Brood does nt fuel Empty .
- - i wonder if anyone of your workers were butthurt about it .
  - I feel like some of them were because all they know are consoles .
- - Ehh  we as a species know next to nothing about space .
  - Actually we know quite a bit about space  especially the physics of space .
- - Uhhhh okay . But its very weird  how it can be done online ... I never understood the whole concept . thanks .
  - It s ok. We ll teach you .
- - They have a very small list of pet food brands there .
  - It was a crowd funded study . It had very limited funding . Hopefully it will open the door for some real funding for this research topic .

- - Clearly they need to use more bananas . You know . For scale .

  - It proves they ca nt rig a playoff game without everyone knowing about it .
- - That s exactly what Secret tried . Luckily Bulldong has enough integrity to not let himself get poached behind the backs of his team like that .

- - THIS GUIDE HAS TOO MANY SYLLABLES . APOLOGIZE 
  - THERE IS NOTHING BETTER THAN TREATING A WOMAN WITH RESPECT

  - They might have been eating crab legs before the game .
- - Just started watching this show on Netflix and it is absolute gold .
  - Look for the quest to find the source of the Nile . It s a good one .
- - Giving love to people that can not give it back to you  while not being able to give love to the people that most likely love you .
  - I m right there with you . A man made me fall in love with him and then denied the prospect of us becoming serious . Saying it was just fun .
  - Damn . No fun messing with people s feelings like that . I m sorry
  - Nah it s all good . Taught me to put up an emotional barrier that I needed . Being too open and trusting can be bad . But thanks .
- - You should know better than to introduce facts to this conversation .
  - Why care about facts when we can hatejerk over the Brits 
- - My problem is I ca nt remember any passwords if I do that so most of my passwords are the same but different variations of each other .
  - If you re consistent with your capitalisation  you do nt have to remember the password . Only the name of the song . You can google the lyrics .
- - Fuck . Really was happy with the play-calling at the start of the year . I d like some stability goddamnit
  - Start of the year is key . There were plenty of shitty calls in the second half .
- - you can call it expanding territories  gaining more natural resources - but in the end it comes always down to money
  - I thought you lose a lot of money in war . Is it only true if you lose 
- - can I come to your town  I m currently setting up paths so it s really messy . I ll bring the axe
  - okay  opening the gate in a sec  laying paths as well lol
- - I dont think its that bad  most Arab fans praised the design and i too like it .
  - I know  he just looks uninteresting to me .
- - ha take a look at your post and then think why you are chat restricted
  - Yeah it only takes one look at the post to see why he got restricted .
- - Wow  weird to imagine Liverpool without Gerrard . The greatest Premier League midfielder  for me .
  - Mancs everywhere are foaming at the mouth .

  - For sure he ll defend well for the first two rounds  after that ... He s gon na get lit up .
- - Evolutionary Biologist reporting in . I have no clue what you re taking about  because neither do you .
  - Not the top of your field I take it ...
- - They were saying he should apologise for raping her  which he has not done . Well done on twisting their argument to make your own point .
  - genuine question  why the obligation for an apology  from a purely democratic point of view  he has served his time in prison . is that not enough 
- - Wow Tenzin  I thought your first new member of the air nation was Bumi .
  - Poor Bumi  even his own brother forgot about him
- - it looks like a stripped down linux distro . i would nt give them much credit .
  - obviously  but its still interesting  and cool .
- - As compared with the thousands and thousands of gallons of water which were used to cool down the Fukushima reactors which later faced leaks amongst other problems 
  - that is nothing compare with mercury from coal that are poisoning the entire ocean .

- - Do nt submit them if they are nt yours . Reported .
  - You re a dick . She knows they have been posted . The picture is mine you fuckwad

  - He just needs to be able to finish dunks among other things
- - You re totally right  but I m going to keep saying offensive defence .
  - That s where I m at too .
- - BRO  Thank you so much  Your music rocks 
  - No ... thank you so much for the feedback and happy new year
- - Geneva convention was nt really written with non state actors in mind .
  - Exactly . There is a legal benefit to not have ISIS considered as an enemy nation .
- - Ok sounds good . Its hard to tell but from looking at pickup cavities in your pic it looks like its a solid top .
  - All I know is that its mahogany top and maple body .
- - In addition to the comments  try some kegel exercises .

- - The mitochondria is the powerhouse of a cell
  - Though I m guessing you might have benefited from better sex ed .

  - One little fight and the dogs got scared . They said You re movin  with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air 
- - I wish the Truman Show was nt revealed to the audience until the end .
  - You know that would have ruined what the movie was going for  but it would have been way more of a thriller  almost a Gone Girl feeling movie .
