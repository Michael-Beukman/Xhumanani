- - I use it on patrols for the speed boost  but would nt bother leveling it beyond that . It s not powerful enough to take into a real mission .
  - If by not powerful enough to take into a mission you mean incredible to take into the raid then I agree with you . MIDA is a pve beast
- - I m convinced this is how it works .
  - After that they play pass the parcel and everyone gets a brown paper bag filled with goodies to take home .

- - I ve got a spot for a female  Really . New Dubai etc . PM me if you re still lookin 
  - Just sent a message out  thanks 
- - So basically the golden rule with officers  play along and make their job easier and they will return the favor

- - Dope tee  where s it from 
  - It s a jumper lol  tourne de transmission blizzard storm

  - Correct . If winning was only by pinfall  submission  or climbing out of the cage I would love them .
  - The same reason he climbs up to the top rope in regular matches 
  - Yeah but if you re expecting him to climb out over  and he turns around to do a frog splash it s more unexpected and exciting .
- - Federal government passes a law ordering the confiscation of all civilian owned firearms .
  - I think the armed side would have an unfair advantage .

  - Yeah  that s the one aspect of the post that he failed to mention or explain .
- - I m right handed but I wink with my right eye so I have to shoot a gun left handed .
  - I thought which eye you close while shooting is based on your dominant eye . I shoot left handed because of this but blink with my right eye .
- - There is a novel called Engines of War  it s really good .
  - Oh really  I ll have to check that out . Thanks 
- - How are those grocers unions working out 
  - Just fine . It turns out that people in the Northeast continue to buy groceries  and the employees have a higher standard of living . Go figure .

  - But this uses math and stuff to prove they re all ugly and you should find new friends .

- - no doubt . and i m a die hard fan of both
  - I am so  so  sorry .

  - A man can hope OP  a man can hope .
- - I do nt hate big Sammy as much as others here  but he would nt fulfill our needs at all . Ca nt rebound or defend the rim .

  - Samuel Dalembert can rebound and defend the rim  Is that why we were so dominant down low last year 
  - He s ok at it  but that s about all he brings to the table

  - Too much emotion  Besides the comment where he talks about having to hold down his anger  could you tell me why you disagree with the interview 
- - Question . Why was Carolina charged a timeout if the clock was stopped 
  - By rule  the if a player is injured with under two minutes left in the half  his team is charged a timeout

  - Yeah  that was bugging me the other day when I looked a photos of the real observatory .
- - Of course . Anything for our friends in the ESSR .
  - I m very pleased to hear it .

  - The fact that it is a successful game is a little sad .
- - Do you mean to put a tape loop on the sd card to act as a pull tab 
  - Yeah pretty much . With no fingernails it s a bit of a pain .
- - I knew your post was bullshit based on the title alone .
  - The facts  man . TSLA is operating on pure growth and nothing else . I just want credit when the inevitable happens .
- - Does nt even matter  he is openly gay so the girls are nt fucking him .
  - Lol what is even the point then .
- - What is this   A breakfast for ants

  - I thought people were done bitching about the announcer . Just turn it off if it offends your ears so much

  - Most likely Ben wa balls that are attached via the string . Not sure if that is the proper spelling . Just know how to say it .
- - Needs a better quality . The compression was noticeable with my untrained eyes .
  - It s because the font was Serif . Sans serif and you would have been just fine
