  - Okay  cool . The reason I m asking is because I want to upgrade to the mainline version of a factory shirt I have .
  - I think mainline might trend towards being a marginally slimmer fit . Make sure to note if the factory cut is slim  or regular  and buy accordingly .
- - To quote Liberace . Too much of a good thing is Wonderful
  - Except when it s our tax money they re wasting ...

  - That and they ll all be working extra hard to cover for the missing drive .

  - I cringed  jeeze sorry you had to go through with that .
- - I was let down gameplay wise  but the story and how they chose to repeat certain parts of it throughout the storyline was really good .

- - Ring in the new year  Did you have a bell with you or something 
  - I had a phone . Does that count 
- - And yet i see a ton of other stuff relating to lgbt on here so why is mine different 
  - Because what does your topic have to do with religion

  - It s possible to do that and still disagree with the practice .
- - Do nt you get a basic insurance against theft if you buy the phone with a credit card  I m not from America but I read it sometimes .
  - Most phones in the US are not purchased outright  so I m not sure if any additional insurance through the credit card company would be applicable .
- - A lefty stick  eh  Guess I m not borrowing that . Nice spot . I need to hit the ice soon . Thanks for the reminder .
  - we got righty sticks in garage  Come join
- - Every economy in the world has some level of dependence on a stable US dollar .

  - Did you not see the Purina Gorilla Chow spread all over the right side of the table 
- - You do nt think it also has to do with them being pretty good at counters 
  - Sure it does  but opposing teams really close down against Barcelona .
- - Instructions unclear . fish stuck in dick .
  - Those instructions seemed quite clear considering the outcome ...
- - Dude  he s taking the piss out of you .
  - Im not angry  I just like to prove a point . and I did
- - I disagree . If he s not op do nt change him . That s all I have to say .
  - many gods have not been op but were still changed or slightly toned down . I believe this is one of those situations .
- - If it had just been Plane or Stealth then it d be better but Stealth Plane just sounds stupid . Anyone know where the name leak came for 
  - Just order one from germany  looks like it will stay as alias

  - Great point  I had nt thought of it this way

  - I seen to remember thinking Rodney Mack was pretty racist as well but ca nt recall why 
- - It s still a hell of a lot better than no bidding .
  - No it was nt . Boeing charged top dollar  nothing was saved .
- - It is the polar opposite of that  technically .
  - in practice yes  but the fight played out that way . no doubt cerrone was trying to take jury out  but jury refused to engage .
- - Nice location  This would also double as a great cover photo 
  - I had nt thought of that . I probably would have framed it differently if I had . Thanks 
- - Just remembered why I still have nt realized my childhood dream of playing with lasers all day .

  - I ca nt wait that long for the fix
- - Do nt worry  when was the last time you used the e key 
  - True . In fact I never even bother to use the extraordinarily obsolete letter E. It s never used in anything . Especially in common words .
- - that does nt seem that sustainable . I feel that honoring them by giving them a skin set is enough .
  - it would be like writing graffiti all over summoners rift
- - I ve never used a typewriter  but my mom did with her thesis and she said it was like the worst fucking thing ever . Why would anyone want this 
  - Some people like typing  and are better at it than writing by hand .
- - medium would be too small  L or XL
  - Alright that s what I assumed . Thanks man .
- - Mariota is nt accurate ... pah . Let s go back to some of the throws he made in the Arizona game . Last I checked those were some tight ass windows
  - I remember the arkansas state game . Just in the first quarter he was making throws i never expected any redshirt freshman to make .
- - Lol no problem I like helping  But in text I always feel like I sound like an ass when I correct people .
  - It s almost like scoffing before correcting . Even if you try to be helpful  it comes off as arrogant and people tend to take it as rude .
- - What breed is this   It is adorable 
  - A mix of shih tzu and another breed that we re not sure of
- - They do nt . Most of the people are getting these pictures off of Google .
  - That Google guy seems to have the largest collection of uranium glassware  and he has a fine selection of porn too .
- - Yeah  but then you ve brought a knife to a gunfight .
  - If you re having to use the knife that is already the case . It just has an empty revolver attached to it .

  - I dont think the server is even up
- - Coal beanies are very nice . Wearing one right now .
  - Mind saying which one  There is so many on the catalog .
- - Why does it matter that she s a girl 
  - I would like to know  too  but apparently it s wrong to ask that on the pcmr sub .
- - Only because uneducated ones are weighing that statistic down .
  - Using that same logic  gaming is more lucrative because pros can make millions per year  but the unskilled ones weigh the statistics down ...
- - great  i m ready to go . my town or yours 
  - Give me a minute and I ll open my gate .
- - It s getting harder to have a nice car with the cops going after people with VI s lately .
  - VI s  Not familiar with this  but last thing I need is to give cops a reason to go after me more than they already do .
- - Saw their first set ever at coachella last year . It was super fun . I d recommend it .
  - Same here  it was a fantastic show . I listen to their set on soundcloud all the time . They were having so much fun

- - how long are you taking offers for and when are you making a decision 
  - well  you see my reserve  when it s hit i right away .
- - I ve just come back from the first session of the new year . The sheer volume of quarter squats was unbearable .

  - I feel like that was kind of the point since he represents a ram  his focus is always what he is charging at .
- - Anthony Davis is a meme tier MVP candidate are you kidding me  Or was it worded like if the season were to end today who would you pick 
  - Even if it ended today I would nt pick him .
- - I have to find the source  but apparently Steven Spielberg s halo series has a budget comparable to Game of Thrones ... I think it ll be much better haha
  - That s the greatest thing I ve ever heard .
- - SK s ability to stay graceful and professional during this time  and throughout  show that she is in her own journalistic camp . The Intercept ca nt touch her .

  - Will post a link of the images I used when I have access to my laptop .
- - You re a cool OP  reporting in if you re still going
  - yes i am  would you rather be Rudy or Rocky 
  - Rocky because he s more badass and I do nt understand anything about American football . Could I have another question if it is nt too greedy 
  - you can have as many as you want . would you rather have link karma or comment karma

  - Its crazy  I just rewatched the first gameovergreggy show and their production value has increased insanely .
- - Dave Matthews band  I do nt get it 
  - Why not . I enjoy the music . I think its a little bigger than it should be but I still enjoy it .
- - I was actually referring to the original UK version of The Office . I found the US version quite poor
  - Oh  yeah  The UK version is great 
- - I m pretty sure that beauty will be a foldable mirror

  - Wow  what an embarrassment you must be when your family brings you out in public .
- - You re not discussing how to catch gasoline using vans .
  - I m too busy marveling at the brilliance of my dog .

  - Rip off . Take caffeine and ephedrine if possible
- - I convince myself divas do these things on purpose  specially Layla .
  - I think Layla does it to just do it .
- - Probably  The dog will absolutely be fine . Share with it more often 
  - Some dogs are sensitive to sudden changes in diet  including human food ; not every dog has an iron gut . What one dog can tolerate may give another pancreatitis .
- - I DID NT EVEN THINK ABOUT BEING AN ACTUAL POKEMON . ANSWER CHANGED . I M DRAGONITE . BECAUSE DRAGON .

  - Thanks  I removed it  I ll fix it in a bit .
- - if only they gave him back his original passive which you ... made sense when you consider how dangerous he is to himself instead of the half assed on he has now

- - Cocaine s a hell of a drug .
  - After party sounds a hell of a lot more fun than the event was .
