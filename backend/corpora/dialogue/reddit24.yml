  - Haha  no problem sir . Enjoy that beast of a card 
- - Yep . That was it . Thanks .
  - No problem  sometimes you just miss the things right in front of you . I know i have done it many times while building
- - These comments remind me of that time the time traveler did an AMA
  - Guys  this question sounds really familiar  but I ca nt remember why . Anyone remember someone asking a similar question 
- - I understand that was part of the agreement in your shady reinstatement . I m on to you  mister .
  - How was my reinstatement shady  And how formal are these pants  Like Tuxedo formal or dinner party formal  Genuinely curious .
- - Think they ll ever do Viking era Sweden or Iceland  It would be a pretty neat setting despite the lack of large cities .
  - Well consider that if they did that  they d have to go back to naval gameplay .
- - Are you dating the girl  or her mother 
  - That s a fair point  but the mother does kind of have a say if I can even see her daughter let alone date her .
  - Then tell your girlfriend that your having trouble with the relationship because of her mother .
  - I ll do that  thank you .
- - Name your newborn after a child that fell from a window to his death  Nevah .
  - Haha yeah I know right  I actually had a bit during my short lived stand up career about that . Just seems like a bad omen .
- - Does anyone remember when top gear was good 
  - Yeah . Just watched their newest season .
- - Andy Dalton looks like either a Bond villain or a Sith Lord .
  - Or that kid from children of the corn .
- - Piss in the backyard when I can . It s such a waste to throw away clean water just to get rid of relatively innocuous substance like urine .
  - Also  it is super fun to pee outside .
- - I sure hope so . I just do nt want to have to pull against steve smith sr again . My poor little heart ca nt handle it
  - did u see that video of the little kid crying about steve smith 
- - eh forget it . I thought I would get more  but got what I expected .
  - Like I said  you are free to remain ignorant .

  - well I dont even care about they re opinion  their probably just gay  tbh

- - Any guesses on release date  I will buy this if the timing is right .
  - I feel like it ill be march but im hoping for feb .
- - i live in france . only americans view the US as the world 
  - Either way  tap water is not safe to drink where I live . Not everyone has the benefits of first world infrastructure and regulations .
- - Stunning  Love it all . Beautiful work . Noob question . Did you do anything to your lips  They look so totally different .
  - Nope  And I did nt change the lighting or anything for the pictures  so I m not sure what s up with that .
- - Sorry  should have said - Windows .
  - so for Windows  if you re looking for easy but not as simple as Windows Movie Maker  I d suggest Sony Vegas
- - The Steam reviews are ... worrying . Does anyone here have experience with this game 
  - It is nt a great game  but it s more fun than it deserves to be .
- - Those seats in the front are a real pain in the neck .
  - For the eyes too  Try going from normal to cross-eyed every couple of minutes .
- - reply when you re on  ill add you
  - I ca nt see the Friend Code . It does nt finish .
- - Does Marcus snort a shit ton of coke before each game  He s like a damn jackrabbit
  - That s Manziel . Mariota only gets high on life .
- - Yall and West Virginia have to win one eventually  I mean the Law of Large Numbers mean that yall will have to some time .
  - West Virginia does not have to win one .
- - What is this ordering over the phone  And getting it shipped home 
  - Yes I believe so  but you can also pay and do in-store pick up which I do .
- - Well if you want to be a Lil sarcastic bitch  then well yeah its a great idea .
  - I fail to see the sarcasm of the situation ...
- - Because domestic abuse among hobbits and any particular team s chances of winning are entirely different things  perhaps 
  - Uhh  your banter is crap . Have another go .
- - I think Ryback s model looks good .
  - Theres definitely some unreal face morphing during his entrance  but during a match his character model looks flawless . Favourite to play as so far .
- - I do nt see any vests  Does vest have a definition I am unaware of 
  - How do you call the clothes on top of his body 
- - Why is Shots fired under quotation marks  At first I thought it meant the figurative usage .
  - at the time the link was posted reports were still unconfirmed and BBC had put link up with quotes . The BBC link is constantly updated .
- - Tempting but I am going to wait for a bundle  I heard the DLC is better .
  - Get both . The main game and DLC are both great if you like survival horror . It s definitely worth the price it s at now .
- - You can clone it with the likes of clonezilla etc .
  - is clonezilla like a program i just download 
- - Sry im new . Why does it hve a bad rep
  - People think that it is too slow and costly to be used effectively .
- - But now I expect a full race report after you finish  regardless of results .
  - I will  I ll post on this sub  Thanks for your encouragement
- - Cool they both seem nice Let me know when your ready
  - Oh wait I need to add you sry forgot
- - Bloody Its just as usable as fuck but more brittish .
  - yeah ... but then you end up sounding ... british .
- - Currently building a pc ... For arma is it better having a stronger cpu or graphics card
  - Nothing works with arma . You will get poor fps no matter the setup .
- - Thanks  Have fun  What are you hoping for 
  - a date with my So and to spend time together  thanks 
- - Just once  try . if you wore it to bed  I d fuck you  Report back with results .
  - As a woman  this is slightly more obvious than I d prefer . Trail off after the comma for better results . Give a lady a chance to realize .
- - Serious question . what happened to Pearson  He seems to have really trailed off after his insanely hot start .
  - Kings have trailed off . Not just Pearson
  - Fair enough . The team is just waiting for the playoffs to wake up  I assume .
  - Unless they miss the playoffs . The way theyre playing  they definitely will miss the playoffs
- - Hahaha  yeah i gathered the sort of price they go for . I am a web dev . PM me if you want to know more . p
  - I m a python dev that fucks around pentesting for extra cash  I am also a stripper on the side but that is for fun .
- - Apparently I am not well liked  even though I am totally awesome . It does nt help that I m broke .
  - I like you . We are similar . Because of that  I call you friend .
- - The Thunder announcer sounds like he s calling an auction  it s hilarious
  - Usually a radio guy so he s used to calling faster than TV
  - That makes sense . Kinda wish he had an old timey accent too
  - I say  I say he done thrown the hammer down .
- - Then tell me . Why Jews  Kurds are a bigger population after all .
  - Jews and Kurds and other minorities who identify as nations should have their own countries  the point is that not only Arabs .
- - Looks like something Nike would put on some Roshe s
  - I ll take your word for it . I know nothing about shoes .
- - Yes  I ca nt imagine why Ontario is reluctant to enslave itself to Quebec s energy industry .
  - NB is too for some reason . Not the people . But the governments . They want to sell NB Power to them .
- - Shit . They ve found Funaki s weak spot 
  - That s crazy talk . No such thing .
- - Yeah cardinals do nt have a fucking QB  defense is solid though  but no ... prepare to lose ur best player . I m sorry my friend .
  - They do nt have their starting RB either
- - My grandma told me I was voluptuous once . I almost cried because I thought she was saying I was fat .
  - Voluptuous was supposed to mean big boobs on a normal size person but apparently we have all been lied to .
- - WHY would you make a Viktor only account if you never played him 
  - Account does nt have much IP and Random.org helped me to decide . I m a decent player  I think I can handle it well .
- - Where is this from  I would love to read about Batman fucking up the League
  - I m commenting so I can also be told where this is from .
- - Congrats on the new digs  Sounds like some prime real estate .
  - WHAT  I CA NT HEAR YOU 
- - I really  really hope you re joking .
  - Fraid not my friend . Look at the loading screen for Obsidian  Obsidian is owned by Bethesda .
- - Exactly . I ca nt say they do nt deserve it  but fuck I would never want that to happen to me .
  - Well if your a French politician that fucks everything that moves you have no worries .
- - Yes  three of the six . It s up to your professor as to when they ll activate them .
  - I was going to wait until tomorrow  but I got just could nt wait . I took the plunge 
- - They wo nt do you much good . It would be much more useful to hang a pair of Rock Rings near your desk if your work environment allows it .
  - dont really have a place to hang those  thanks though
  - Could you do pull-ups from under your desk  That s a decent exercise .
  - i wanted something during video conference meetings  dont think it would go over so well if i disappeared under my desk during them  ha
- - It s based on the actual temperature  the humidity  and the wind . They put the numbers into a formula and get the apparent temperature .
  - I think we d all like more information on this formula
- - While I disagree with what he s trying to say  he s not calling them dogs  he s just using that as an example .
  - You do nt think that particular choice of animal might have been deliberate  Not even consciously necessarily . Bigotry influences even minor decisions like the metaphor of animals .
- - Could somebody please explain to me why I should sell my team for the TOTY release  This is my first Fifa game and I do not understand very well .
  - Then do nt . If you do nt understand why then DO NT DO IT

- - Was there  Did she just photoshop it on and leave it at that or did she try to pass it off as real 
  - No i do nt think so  i m on my phone so ca nt link now .
- - Khedira started it . Raul Garcia is not a guy to fuck with .
  - How exactly did Khedira start it  Please  tell us .
- - Precisely why this is in trashy . Acid is nt all that trashy but the attention whore doing acid is .
  - Employer here  yeah  it s trashy .
- - Author is correct about exponential growth . Those charts show percent of GDP  and GDP grows exponentially . Ergo entitlement spending has grown exponentially .
  - Then you should use nominal values and not percentage points .
- - All these Ovi sitting Dion down comments LOL . he sat himself down tripping over his feet
  - He s been getting in the smirnoff tonight . Like me . D
- - Dude you live in the middle east  they do nt care about warrants and will execute you for trafficking drugs  do nt order .
  - That s racist . Do you think the middle east is just one big contiguous country 
- - Matthew Kenney has a new very swank restaurant in Santa Monica . He also has a new book coming out soon .

  - i asked the girls they said it s sexy even my boys said it s fair play
- - Humble Defector . Sick monored combo with Homeward Path . D
  - Not to mention Kiki-Jiki or Feldon of the Third Path .
- - oops sorry right i forgot how some people ca nt tell s a r c a s m
  - There s no sarcasm on the Internet .
- - Go play call of duty  csgo is for the good players kido
  - so wanting a fair game makes me bad 
- - Then why do you care about a discussion on moderate Muslims  if this is your position 
  - What if I told you that someone can not be religious and still care about basic human rights that should be awarded to everyone regardless of ideology 
- - I always end up going to Office Depot and paying them to fax it instead . I do nt own a machine  nor do I know anyone that does .
  - That s what I ended up doing  only Staples . It was the first time in my life I ever used a fax actually .
- - I never have and doubt I could even if I tried .
  - Same here . Have never cried over fiction . But I have felt some emotion
- - There s a great documentary by Chris Gallant called  Niagara Falls . Tale of Two Cities  that explores this .
  - Do you have a link  I searched but a bunch of different stuff comes up .
- - Nice to see that Clegg is still bitter about getting trounced in those debates . Bet Farage is happy that he well and truly left his mark .
  - I know right . What the hell has Clegg done since then . He is absolutely pathetic .
- - You re hopeless . I give up .
  - Who did you guess did this when you first heard the news  Be honest . Did you think it was some Hindus 
- - How do you get your statusbar to show there is a message there 
  - its called confero and it shows all the apps that have notifications since i have my badges turned off
- - Allot of people would say it s gon na be ej s fsu successor . I m not one of them .

  - Oh yeah . Some say he s the greatest of all time .
  - Well manuel was great and he followed the Goat .
- - Should nt this have a spoiler tag 
  - No  do nt worry none of this actually happened in the show  just a theory
- - HAHAH DAMN IT  I will recognise that slang anywhere in the world . Malaysia  And I ve got a feeling it was an Indian saying it .
  - Yes  it was in fact an Indian dude
- - Never noticed . Is it a problem for you 
  - Not really a problem as Im starting to learn rotations now  it just seemed to me that having your feet closer together helps spins earlier in the progression
  - Do you mean closer together like a closer stance on a snowboard or closer together like right next to each other on skis 
  - No i mean how skiiers can spin with their feet next to each other which helps faster spins come easier
- - adding the fc right now and then the gate s gon na open up . sorry for the wait
  - Cool . thanks . On my Way .
- - Guess I ca nt complain about Georgia sports anymore Edit . I was just making fun of the Mississippi graphic
  - Spring training will be here soon enough and the Georgia choke will be back in the air
- - This is such a mismatch  why are you using that justice league lineup 
  - Why is it a mismatch  Besides Captain Atom  who else is that powerful 
- - Its a terrible fucking game . Your dad is right . But man i love this game 
  - maybe how you play it ... I have nt killed one single hooker 
- - The other side also has ducks  or have I never seen rabbits before 
  - The duck s bill is the rabbit s ears .
- - One  two  Funko s coming for you  Boba Fett sits  Thank you 
  - I did nt know those were a thing . Cute 
- - I think they should remove one shot kills to the head . Most of the new players cant really do that .
  - Why are you comparing one shot kills to that bomb spot 
  - They might lose one round to it  and thats about it . I think it s really silly to patch something that isnt even an issue .
  - One round can decide the game ... How many draws did you have  That round could make a different outcome .
- - That Joker cosplay is fucking epic . He looks right out of the comic .
  - I want to know who the guy is 
- - Harry Kane . Him and James Wilson playing together would be awesome to watch . . D
  - Why Harry Kane  Would you not rather the kid proves himself first before we make a move for him 
- - I m pretty sure you did nt read what I said but I hear you .
  - Actually  Imgur deleted again . I commented on my original post with the text .
- - I d have a hard time letting him leave . I might pull a Misery and just keep him for the stories .
  - Does nt he have bony muscles or muscly bones or something  Would make pulling a Misery that bit easier . Sorry Brick .
- - Shoulda scanned his weapons . I bet he had railguns .
  - Unfortunately I got interdicted right after seeing him and getting the screenshot .
- - So what if oil is the trade for a free Kurdistan 
  - That trade was with america . Erdogan has supported another horse in this race .
- - I made my egg trap and I m so grateful for seeing your post  So awesome 
  - Awesome  Have a blast with the idea  . D
- - Implying she could say no ... The expression on her face was nt the one of someone happy about a proposal
  - I do nt know if we watched the same stream .
- - Wait why ca nt you buy liquor on Sunday s  When has this ever been a thing 
  - Depends on the state . In Texas  you can only buy liquor at a bar on Sundays . Beer and wine only at the stores .
- - So your lamp has seen the light  That s good .
  - urs lamp seems like the bulb is bit dim
- - Surprised to see how much of a difference it was in appearance looks more high end as well now
  - Thank you  I thought it changed the entire look of the kitchen too 
- - Premium quality  luxurious toilet paper . It would be like angles kissing my arse for the rest of my life
  - You mean angels I hope . Angles kissing your arse sounds painful ...
- - abortion and is nt your governor a national laughingstock  slenderman .
  - What about abortion  Scott Walker is temporary . A couple of pre-teen girls .
  - do nt they have like communist romania type abortion restrictions there .
  - Do you have some sort of example 
- - and if we make it smaller  maybe give it wings so it can transport people across ...
  - Yea and we could have attendants serve meals and beverages  This would be totally impractical though 
- - Car is in the shop . Looks like the oil change and new spark plugs did nt help anything ...
  - Ugh that sucks  I m sorry 
- - For a second there I thought I was looking at Sam Witwer  Do you have the sliders 
  - I can check my image folder tonight after work  I m not sure if I kept that one .

- - I like your writing style brother . Great way of explaining that flips are all about the commitment .
  - Haha thanks man  Figured I d add a little flair to an otherwise bland instruction .
- - Hope you re enjoying that time off . D
  - Yup . Lazing around  playing video games . Paradise .
