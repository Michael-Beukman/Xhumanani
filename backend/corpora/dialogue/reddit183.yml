- - Just going by what history has told us . I have no reason to believe they will win the division until they do it .
  - Ok  i see  but just understand you dont win games next year based on how well you did the previous season .
- - Sorry  on the blue ak s I want a blue back .
  - Alright  good luck with your trade 
- - But how do you get data about amount of pirated copies 
  - Have the app phone home by hitting a URL with version and platform data .
- - Might this be an evolutionary advantage  Is it possible that in the coming millions of years all frogs will do this 
  - It s more likely only useful for frogs living in a certain unusual set of environments .
- - How did they stand on the cliff and not get mugged by the minotaur that spawns behind you 
  - IF you re a bladedancer and go invisible  the minotaur will despawn . Not saying that s what happened  but possible .
- - Thanks for sharing  This is the first I ve heard of this project . I wonder why the local media is not covering this 
  - Right   I wonder where the location will be .
- - when you buy oil in USD  the value of USD is not static until it s time to sell .
  - That s true of a lot of other investment vehicles  including stocks .
- - OK  got your PM . There was no card in the box . The latch is not bent .
  - Awww it would have been cool if it turned out . C
- - The first half of that game was brilliant but the second parts been wiped from my memory .

- - Or perhaps  just maybe ... You are not an otherkin 
  - But then you ca nt get those oppression points .

  - Ahem  the chick is ... you know .
- - So she was shot on Thursday morning  or died on Thursday morning 
  - She was shot and died on Thursday morning . No connection to Wednesday s events .
  - No connection yet  I find it highly unlikely that Paris is so awash with heavily armed and armored men that these two events are unrelated .
  - Or you know like most muslims they love their AKs and have been waiting for an opportunity
- - The idea is that you know before the shooting starts
  - The truth is that gunmen specifically target gun free zones . Name a location where a mass shooting occurred where people were allowed to conceal carry .
- - Haha I think the saddest part is that she did nt even realize the was being rude 
  - Oh I bet she realised  I knew a girl like this who would subtly insult others to make them feel like they were nt as good as her .
- - Normally the departures are all blue and the arrivals are green . Both boards look like this now .
  - For a second I thought  whoa  that s a lot of delayed flights . Then I saw what sub I was looking at .

  - Please explain how one of the most inclusive diverse communities that not long ago was the laughing stock of the world is oppressive . I d really like to know .

  - I learned something new today  thanks for being the most level headed person in this thread . P
- - Stop trying to make tiny leaders happen . It s not going to happen .
  - We re a community that has these tools . Why should nt we discuss ways to use these tools to bring fun into our lives 
- - or you could stop clicking the links . . P
  - Never crossed my mind in the years I have been here  first time I hear the proposal  stunned me here . Thanks for the advice .

  - It would be interesting to examine the original text . In Greek 
- - Not sure if they would be allowed to use a community sticker as the picture  if they can then they should  that is a nice sticker .

  - He has been advised by many parties . Probably wants to play it as low key as possible .
- - I think the record company wants Brendon to become a solo act but I think he ll do at least one more album as a band before making the change .
  - He could pull a Rob Thomas and do both  alternating . But burnout is the enemy of the artist for sure .
- - The bible calls for death in it so many times too . Extremism is nt restricted to certain religions  just look at Christian extremists in Africa like Kony .
  - somehow i doubt you have read whole Bible and Quran and then make comparison
- - Oh really  So private torrenting without ISPs watching and sending notices 
  - I ve been doing it for years and never had a problem . Most trackers and clients these days support some level of encryption .

  - Oh of course nothing is faster than using a physical keyboard
- - I really like the site but my only suggestion would be to format the prices a bit nicer . Just to include commas really .
  - Just posted an update  including this . Thanks for the suggestion 
- - Nope . I wonder about my purpose though .
  - I wonder if there is milk left .
- - So  do we just totally fabricate stories now  Is this the only way to get that sweet  sweet karma 
  - You dont get karma for text posts . So it s as useless as karma  which is useless .
- - I use the browser on my phone because I need to zoom in  due to crap eyesight .
  - You can increase the text to rediculous sizes
- - We had a few of them but my dog chased them all down and ate them . Apparently they taste delicious to dogs .

  - Its not getting fixed anytime soon . Just work around it  try not to agitate it .

  - as if handstand pushups are nt hard enough by themselves xD

  - Ah  cool . Guess I m not perceptive at all .

  - Well hey man  thanks a bundle  It s not often I get messages like that  so thank you VERY much 
- - That is quite true . It s a very long time . There is no conceivable medical advance which will enable me to live long enough to witness it .

  - We do that as well . Maybe not today  but we usually do .
- - impressive . is wind yeti really worth it  feels like a waste for me to train him after working so hard to train n rune darion n ahman
  - Darion and ahman are probably a better pair . I used wind yeti because I hadnt had a chance to farm for those guys yet .
- - Wait  if you ve got the spray bottle thingy  why ca nt you just attach it to the spray bottle it came with and chuck that in the fridge

- - All FSU fans to the salt mines .
  - Really  I was under the impression that everyone was heaping their pent up salt on us .
- - I Thought this was going to be a lot closer of a game . Colorado is a good team . This is really surprising to me . Good game Buffs .
  - I really enjoyed the fans after the game . At this rate  there will never be a rivalry
  - Right now I hate ASU more than I hate byu . The Buffs are hardly a contemptible group .
  - I hate USC almost as much as BYU . ASU I do nt like much but I do nt feel a big hatred for them .
- - ya  they re calling it impossible dream . Ask someone else about it  I do nt know much
  - I ll have to check it out . Maybe move the Alien there .
- - I really do nt think the changes are that significant that anyone needs to bother with this .

  - Hah  right  I think I read somewhere that this is the lowest combined fuel economy of any new car on sale in the USA .

  - This . XY will introduce you to mega evolution better  play that before ORAS

- - Oregon wins this year . You guys win next year .
  - I ll be honest  I think Oregon has been jipped out of a championship a few times now . Their running game and play calling is awesome to watch .

  - Hey man  gypsies are people too 
- - I think of google as a good company  but ... Yeah
  - they try to have the image of a good company  but the reality is  that they are the same as any other giant tech company
- - that s really nice  is this ink pen 
  - Nope . Just trying out my new tablet .
- - I got it too . Apparently  its because of being rooted . And other LINE games apparently already do this .
  - That is ridiculous . Merely having root access should nt be a flag .
- - In terms of dodging skill shots  what do you do if someone bets you that you wo nt eat the bread 
  - Then obviously I tell my mom to get the loaf .

  - Can confirm . Ending a whole pack of thralls with one shot is insanely fun and satisfying .
- - Salt and vinegar potato chips . A lot of people I know do nt like them  but they just melt in your mouth .
  - They also melt your mouth if you eat enough of them . The pain tastes soo good .
- - Wow  the people asking the questions are just fucking ridiculous . The gene pool needs a little chlorine methinks ...
  - If you want better questions then go and ask some yourself .
- - yup  Its this one I was looking for XD Im on right now
  - Thanks for commenting here too  haha . Enjoy your shiny Gastly . . D
