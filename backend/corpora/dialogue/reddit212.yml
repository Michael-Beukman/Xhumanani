  - Being sedentary also causes me lots of discomfort  and I hope exercise will in long term correct my body .

- - Just wait till they start protecting historical piles of shit .
  - They said windsor right in the title of the article .
- - Reading that hurt my brain . I think I lost a few IQ points .
  - I know  right  When I first opened it  I had to re-read it a few times .
- - Nope  and I hope I never agree with you .
  - I m inclined to agree  but what else is there to do 
- - They both look so REAL to me .
  - I really hate you and really like you at the same time .
- - This offends me because it is a picture that was already posted .

- - Yeah  Too bad they re the majority though ... Oh well  democracy is nt for everyone .
  - They are not the majority of the population  they are merely the majority of the voting portion of the population .
- - because suggs  doom  ngata  jernigan  mcphee  upshaw  smith  mosely would knock him looser than big ben got knocked last week .
  - You re delusional if you think that an accomplished veteran like Tom Brady will surrender to a player simply because of the name on the back of his jersey .
- - Exactly  so if you do nt like it  do nt comment .
  - Ok I get it  you only want good comments . Good luck with that
- - Do you know if that guy Perez from Malaga is any good

  - We actually went after CJ . Panthers outbid us .
- - Have nt counterparty basically done what Gavin outlined in his blog 
  - Not really . Counterparty lets you write contracts involving XCP  not BitCoin . Gavin wanted to use BitCoin  of course
- - There are nt that many abandoned buildings to break into around here .
  - I may or may not have done a few locked campus buildings as well .
- - I ll consider them in replacement of maybe a bump in the night . thanks for the suggestion 
  - I would only use one  maybe two copies of it . Drawing one will last you the whole game  as it has little value outside of your graveyard .
- - I just got around to RMAing it . Replacement should arrive next week and I can test .
  - Thanks for the reply . Do I have to file an RMA within a certain time period after the sale 
- - Quick question  could nt you massage the kale with the oil from the tuna

  - The most breathtaking part of the entire game is walking through the Garden of Eden for the first time ... Amazing atmosphere and visuals
- - Creative use of a hair clip . Not sure it s WTF  though .
  - Same thing happens if a penis is involved
- - Why does that butler hate the doctor 
  - A doctor was considered a middle class profession and Sprat is a snob .

  - I do nt eat until I am full . I eat until I want to die . - Louis C.K .

- - This one is nt too far from me . Thanks for the recommendation 
  - I used to go to this one when I was younger  they really improved the place 
- - I believe this is an issue with recount . Try switching to skada . It takes up less memory and is nt as buggy .
  - It is recount you can disable it or disable the auto sync feature of recount
- - I hope that one day we can sit down and dissect your whole life and tell you what a classless fuckhead you were because of a single silly action .
  - Did I ever say he s a classless fuckhead  What he did was classless as a coach in that specific context but I never said he s a classless person .

  - Well Christopher Eccleston is in the picture so of course it s not from an episode .
- - I m sure  . D Shall we do my town or yours 
  - I ll come to you . Adding you now .
- - So there is no way for me to get flair for a month ... that kinda sucks .
  - Buy CSGO keys  then buy a game with the keys  then sell it for the same price for someone else  and you already have two confirmed trades .

  - I do nt know what that expression means  but sounds good to me  so you re welcome 
- - I agree . I wouldnt date someone with a history of repeated or egregious cheating and would definitely want to know .
  - But the past is the past . I m different now . We need to trust each other and look forwards for any hope of making it .
- - Yea . Except in America they do nt believe in putting money towards roads and public transport .
  - We spent plenty of money on roads . And that s it . And only if they re paid with toll money .

  - The round icon mask comes with enkel . However I have used FolderEnhancer to display one icon as a folder preview .
- - I do nt like to think of it as death . More like  ascension . It is serving a greater purpose .
  - It only lives for a year anyway so why not harvest and use it  right 
- - Passenger pigeons . They used to be one of the most abundant birds in North American before they were hunted into extinction .
  - Dammit  I was going to use that one 
- - I m guessing those are directed at me  If so they re not even close to being true  but whatevs
  - Yeah  they re not all true  like the FFVII ones you re spouting out . Let someone like what they like .

  - I never had the problem on the old version . Unfortunately  I can not go back to the old version . It forces me to update it .
- - I want a cool perc like that but I feel like the weight would break it at the joint if I used it .
  - As long as it s quality glass you ll never had a problem . I ve had way more trouble with tree percs
- - I find The Inner Light is overrated as well . Conversely  I think Yesterday s Enterprise is the best of the series .

  - My mom straight out told me I was an accident that already happened ... when I was born .
- - Or his friend could be making the point that he thinks of op as a better cop or is somehow different from other cops .

- - Probably because Giroux and voracek are literally our only two players who can skate the puck into the zone
  - Could be worse . On the Devils it s Gomez and jagr . At least your guys are younger .
