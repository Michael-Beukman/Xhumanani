  - You can just buy it  but you might end up with a big shipping charge .

- - Sounds like he was a good kid . He coulda easily kicked your ass but went for self defense instead .
  - He really was . We made amends and ended up becoming friends over that summer .
- - Ok  the secrecy serves a purpose  but at what point are the industry groups here writing the agreement taking advantage of that secrecy given specifically to trade agreements 
  - I watched the video that was linked and it seemed to suggest that congress put the special interest groups into the negotiations as advisors . So ask congress I guess 
- - Get a watch face that supports weather . Or look out the window .

  - I assumed they will just link to something like Clash of clans or Travian
- - yeah  no shit but this comes off as a cry for attention rather than help
  - What would you do if today you found out he comit suicide and died

- - I came in wishing for Dallas loss  but now I m kinda worried about Lions .
  - We re good man . Nada to worry about .
- - I ve also seen trucks turn their lights off momentarily to let a passing truck know it s safe to return to the slower lane .
  - In the UK and Australia  they flash high beams rather than turn lights off .
- - Any leads on where to buy the jacket 
  - Not that I know of  sorry .
- - Your posting only shows the angry cynic you truly are . I hear it s pretty easy to be an asshole on the internet .
  - Why do nt you invite him to live with you . There is an easy fix to his situation .
- - It was either burn it  or haul it away in a garbage truck .
  - Or just leave it where it is .
- - That is really impressive . There is no S in Eau Claire . Still amazing though

- - This guy s wife is way out his league .
  - Let me get you some peanut butter for that jelly .
- - I just got it ... Tobias Harris looks like Trevor Noah
  - I think the team makes fun of him for looking like J. Cole  haha .
- - That s what Suicide Squad will probably do .
  - Super Max has the potential to do the same thing .
  - It makes me happy that the are rumors that they want to revive that .
  - I always thought it d make a better animated movie than live action .
- - We re already seeing how they deal with it - just like any other crime . Selectively ignoring the nationality of the perpetrator when mentioning it would nt be politically correct .

- - That made me really sad for some reason . I can totally picture these gfys as their reaction
  - They re in a better place . Well  not really  but just pretend .
- - Google . Also  talk with other more senior devs . Even if they work in another language  they may have other applicable ideas .
  - I second this - I ve work in various languages and the only real difference is the language syntax  the programming techniques and best practises are pretty universal .
- - Everyone puts every and day together when they are supposed to be separate . It s rare that someone would separate them when they should be together ...
  - Says the guy that put them together .
- - That may have been the worst game we ve played all year . That was so incredibly infuriating to watch
  - Up there with Portland  Miami  and Atlanta for most frustrating . Just when they looked like it was gon na get close to a lead change  Detroit pulled away
- - Did your GM offer you a lower position at the same pay rate  Or do they just want you out 
  - I was offered a pay cut and a demotion ...
- - There were no winners in this argument it seems .
  - You know what I m about to say .
- - Where do you find the librarian  I ve combed Skyhold all over in three plays  never come across anyone like that .
  - in the library  funnily enough . i ve never noticed him before either and i am uncertain why he showed up .
- - Problem with that is you could then cheat the system by adding actual violations after you were reviewed the first time .
  - Then keep track of what the actual violation was  not just the type of violation .
- - Blue seems way more unique . I dig my blue one 
  - I absolutely love the blue color on mine . I especially like how the metal is colored .
- - I m surprised no scavengers have cleaned it out yet .
  - It s pretty well guarded to be honest .
  - The keyboards seem to be missing  I wonder if someone got em or they were never used .

- - Posting from yesterday s tomorrow morning today . Inquiring minds need . To know 
  - I had to remind them but I did get my stay comped . Score

  - You witnessed the play . Be your own judge . I m certainly biased  but even I m not blind .
- - What is it about salt that creates this ion movement  Does it have something to do with a crystalline structure

  - as far as I could tell we were all talking to approach control  which was providing voluntary separation for us even though most were in class E
- - Agreed . Would love to see it turn into a franchise for Denzel .
  - It s pretty obvious that s what they were setting up  but I do nt know how it did at the box office . I loved the show on TV ...
- - WTF is going on with this blasted Saga  FL posted on his facebook account that he DID have a deal with NYCFC 
  - He never said he signed a contract with NYCFC .

  - Which is nt necessarily a bad thing . You are right though . The hose port looks off .
- - Pics and details  You can pm if you want
  - Are you talking about the Roxie or the drop 
- - Hey  our goverment is pretty popular for doing that . When chavez died they said obama injected him cancer 
  - He was injected with arthritis  not cancer . Stop spreading rumors 
- - Ibushi is heeling it up like crazy right  This is unusual for him is nt it 
  - You have to see their first match to get why Ibushi is acting like this . Shinsuke basically sees him as nothing more than a joke .
- - If you do nt like cutscenes then you re just playing for the BANG POW BOOM aspect of the game and might as well just watch a Michael Bay film .
  - So people who do nt like to sit around watching movies should go watch movies instead ... 
  - Yeah did nt sound like it made sense lol . You ever have something make sense in your head and it just does nt work lol
  - Oh yes . I do think I can see where you were coming from  but I just could nt resist pointing it out .
- - This Nutella covered Ritz does nt look like it s about to present the evening news .
  - Yeah OP  most news anchors have  you know  a mouth . I find it hard to believe that a cracker covered with hazelnut spread can replace them .
- - got ta stand your ground man . It s about respect
  - That s what she was doing . It s a two way street brother  but sometimes you have to give way in the narrow spots .
- - I literally just use my APCR rounds to snipe the crew because it seems everything but either bounces or does nt kill like it should .
  - Heat is better for fire starting  how i mean it s more effective .
- - Tommy seems pissed off about Greg s book  I would love it Tommy wrote his own book about The Room .
  - I just finished Greg s book this week . I could nt put it down  it was so great .
- - Can we make it buy one get one free and include Soldado  Maybe some of his fan club on here will get to see him play that way
  - I love your comments even though they re always at the bottom . Never change mate
- - For those that have problems like this at work  contact HR . The managers are clueless most of the time .
  - Def need to read the original post that OP referenced .
- - Solid advice . That makes a ton of sense . Thank you .
  - Buying a used barrel is like buying a used condom . You never know where it s been or what s been done to it .
- - I like your style . Can we be friends 
  - Maybe . But only if you continue to tell me how much you like my style .
- - Nothing more could go wrong by linking it again surely
  - Nah . The internet is definitely not filled with trolls .

  - cant tell you how many times ive done this i just play it in the background
- - You call me an idiot but I was still right on which one it was .
  - A broken watch is still right twice a day .
- - this guy is talking like a troll ... cant really take him seriously
  - Hey  he spent good money at the William Shatner School of Dialog .
- - Because he s a fucking great prospect .
  - Does nt mean we should definitely go for him though
- - Fuck  I was thinking of a trapezoid in my head
  - For what its worth  a rectangle is a parallelogram .
- - I sleep with a towel on my pillow .
  - Shiet  that does nt sound like a bad idea  imma try that now
- - Actually now I m curious  what happens if nobody will pay for a funeral and the estate is negative  Does the state pay for cremation or something 
  - It varies from state to state and by county  but typically there is some assistance provided by human services for basic cremation .
- - Go right ahead and shit on the floor  boy .

- - I was with you until you wanted me to pray .
  - It s the lyrics to a Python song .
  - Well  in that case  TIL another thing .
  - Well  at least you re learning -- that s better than can be said about a lot of people .
- - Look at it this way Bengals  you guys have an amazing punter
  - He s pretty good when the Steelers do nt break him .
- - Where are the numbers for vets counted  A lot of vets are nt pushed that far until after they re separated .
  - Why are nt you asking the guy above for a source 
- - Ok let s say Enrique goes  who would replace him 
  - This is just a dream  but I would love if Cruyff came in to steady the ship  and then a long term coach is found in the summer

- - wow ewk  you are such a delightful conversationalist .
  - That s not one of the usual ways people complain about me . But enough about me  right  Let s talk about what Zen Masters you ve studied

  - you can jump right in . i downloaded it this after noon and i m almost done with it .
- - Gon na use it or hang it up 
  - Hang it up . I got enough discs .
- - THERE IS NO END TO THIS GAME 
  - Tell that to the You Are Dead screen .
- - I do nt support any service where you do nt keep control of your keys . Coinbase probably does nt do that .
  - Coinbase now gives you the option of having control over your keys
- - seems to be edited down . I just watched the first episode  and when Monica is talking about Paul the wine guy  it cuts a bit out .
  - Also when Rachel is cutting the credit cards .
- - We have private health insurers in the UK  they are cheaper than their US equivalents .
  - Well you are comparing it to the US .
- - If FromSoft games has taught me anything is that we will definitely have to go and kill the spider
  - In what video game would you NOT kill the spider 
- - So the NRA is a union  That clears a lot up for me .
  - It a union of people with like minded interest . Just like a union of widget workers is a union of people with like minded interest .
- - Sorry we did nt get to that yesterday . We ll definitely touch on it today .
  - Imposter that does nt even listen to the show 
- - This happened to me just now . Maybe they re adding new missions or bring the Hybrid LB s back for a few days 
  - less people have hybrid the more i can brag about having him .
- - Is my mind crazy  because i see Castile in South Africa  and theres also Spain .
  - Aragon formed Spain  kicked castille out of Europe
- - Shoulda come over to Missouri ; we did nt get shit .

- - It is only worse when you live here
  - Ca nt wait to apply for out of state colleges . It will be my ticket out of here .
- - Damn they crammed that thing next to Endeavour  Jesus .
  - That s just a mock up of half of an orbiter .
- - I have been waiting for krz for a while . It s been sitting on my wishlist . oh well  there s always another sale .
  - I also had nt seen Gettysburg on sale before . I m pretty sure I voted for KRZ in the summer .
- - Needless techs on Nene  Wall  and Westbrook . How many more tonight boys 
  - I dunno about that Nene tech  he swept Adams leg and Steve is still having his calf assessed . If Adams pulled that move on Nene there d be war .
- - I meant mine to be harmless too  which was why I posted serious in front of the question .
  - And your serious question was more whining about his comment .
- - I noticed this yesterday  I think it only shows on the PC though ...  I have nt seen the quotes pop up when I m on the app
  - If you use your phone s browser it ll work .
  - Thanks  I ll have to check it out .
  - Just make sure you are nt in a mobile view . You need to view the desktop version .
- - Why did you leave the house with a phone that had a low battery if you were meeting up with a stranger  Great pictures  though .
  - Batteries do nt last near as long in the cold . They may have been full but not going to put up with this nonsensical cold .
- - Super cool delay  friend has one and it s killer . Just wish catalinbread would stop drinking the hipster juice and start doing some tap tempo pedals .
  - That would be nice . Love me some tap tempo .
- - With Melo  Knicks Without Melo  Wolves
  - What about the Wolves with all their starters  We got most of our wins with Rubio playing btw
- - Dang  glad you re ok  How d that dust taste 
  - I think like burnt baby powder  something metallic . Do nt want to taste it ever again .
- - Can you add the fate route scenes by any chance 
  - Sure . As soon as I get some time today I will do it .
- - It looks like they have been helped out already .
  - great . Awesome what you re doing by the way 
- - Serious question . What actually is the point of this sub 
  - There is nt one . Which is one of the best things about it .
- - Stannis is a year older than Jamie  or in other words  still in his prime .
  - That is a good point . I was stupidly thinking off of show appearance . Hmm ...
- - Mount your friends . Just do it  you ll understand .
  - More people need to know about this game
- - yea just cut him out . he ll get the message eventually . if not  fuck em
  - Yeah I guess  it just sucks even more because I know that s probably what he wants .
- - I ve heard many times that daddy longlegs are the most venomous spider  but they are nt venomous  do nt have fangs  and are nt spiders .
  - Careful  In Australia that parlance does indeed refer to a species of spider . We do nt use that name for harvestmen .
- - I knew it was gon na happen but I watched anyways .
  - It s half way down . Now I know what s gon na happen Edit . fucker .
- - just SUROS Regime or fatebringer . that s it until hard-mode Crota s end for CE primary weapons .
  - That new hand cannon will be mine .
- - No you ca nt have it both ways  Original Poster .
  - Ohh  calling him by his full name  serious . Like when your mom used your middle name
- - I wonder if our defense suffers more from running QBs . They seem to have a tendency to miss tackles .
  - That s what Darryl Washington was for .
- - What does this mean for Curse Academy and LolPro 
  - CA will have to get picked up by another organization  currently rumored to be OpTic . LoLpro may just go away or also have the brand sold .
  - I do nt see why LoLPro would have to go . They can still be LoLPro under the Team Liquid banner in the challenger series
  - That s true . I know liquid said he is fielding another challenger team . Doubt it would be LoLpro though
- - So this is why oddone dipped from tsm
  - Oddone is still at the TSM house .
- - Gerrard  it s pretty obvious why .
  - Its not obvious . If you had an LA Galaxy icon then maybe .
- - You are occupying a spot on the planet that no one else is .
  - Hmm maybe not at a quantum level though .
- - Impossible to make perfect . Do you also blame rape victims for dressing slutty 
  - Microsoft servers were back up in a reasonable time period .

  - That s interesting . Where are you from  UK or mainland Europe 
- - Also junior umpiring taught me pace bowler above the hip on the full no ball  spinner was shoulder .
  - Thanks for the reply  I appreciate it .
- - Eminem is nt blond though  he s a bottle blond .
  - Really  He s not natural  Now that s something I did nt know ... this is like saying Xzibit was thrown in a coal mine .
- - They could also be putting something in their hair .
  - The guy I worked out with who shaved his head had the same underlying scent . It wasnt any product they were using . Edit . a letter
- - Actually yeah  why ca nt you just throw a bunch of marbles on the ground and watch the giants fall over .
  - While we re at it  why do nt we put needles in the stairs too  and hide it under carpet 
- - Do you have an option to expel them in the Intrigue menu 
  - I think I did yeah but I assumed that just expelled people  does it also revoke their holdings 
- - Thanks  ya I went for keeping Schenn . I have a deep league so had to jump on Burrows if its going to pan out .
  - Yea . That s probably a good call then .
- - Brown sauce for sausages  ketchup for bacon .
  - Agreed on the sausages . As for the bacon . you re a heathen 
- - I think the mistake you made was making them think . People hate that .
  - I think I m starting to realize that more and more these days .
- - Should nt we be signing a DM or CB instead of a striker
  - Yes  but if the cash is there he would be a nice pickup .
- - Have nt payed any attention to OB  who s likely to join OG and ON 
  - Still not sure  but I d say TCM if I were to guess .
- - A million people with shotguns can totally beat a hundred people with rifles .
  - Billions of ppl with guns vs a nuke  I think quality would win out in this instance .
- - Trying to find someone in my area to chat with can someone tell me how to navigate 
  - Usually against the rules bruh . Check the side bar . What s good though  Check out opiate roll call
- - Sure  all of that  but I can and do still find it stupid . Just as free as you are to think that .
  - This guy here is very known for his weird kinks  his name is Vortex Kangaroo or something like that  super creepy guy man
- - With a six pack I think it s time to bulk .
  - Thanks . I ca nt for the life of me get rid of that fat at my sides . sigh
- - Calm down man  you re comment is nt very clear about what you mean . Next time put some more thought into what you re writing .
  - Maybe you should put some thought into what you re reading  instead of making an assumption that I was saying Akali uses mana .
- - It would be terrible if there was a repeat of two years ago .
  - So what you re saying is Jacoby Jones catches a TD to send the AFCCG to overtime in Denver 
- - Does your potential employer get to run a credit check on you  What kind of fuckery is that 
  - Happened about a month ago . I did nt get the job because my credit score was nt high enough .
- - I mean a third arm seems most useful . Especially when wrapping gifts ...
  - Wrapping gifts is so frustrating without am extra arm holding the paper down 
- - No questions  no mention of Zen ... Pass .
  - No questions  no mention of Zen ... Pass .
- - EVA Babies  they ll make your dream come true  EVA Babies  but they re suffering from depression too .
  - this same thing went through my mind .

  - After the Buff hit  he seemed very slow getting up . Slower than usual
- - There was nt anything really wrong with Titanfall .
  - I have nt played it  but I ve heard the community evaporated after a couple of months
- - Hey  he looks just like you poindexter 
  - You ve got friends ... you ve got the dud right here . Stand up for yourself poindexter 
- - Thanks  I think I will do that . Hopefully prices will rise enough after tomorrow to make it all worthwhile
  - The market is pretty down on some players ... Some have crashed harder than the lightning rounds on christmas  so I think you might be alright .
- - He never clearly said he did draw it .
  - He didnt in the picture but he told me that hes gon na draw something for me  which i replied to by saying a redhead with big hooters
- - Why do gaming tables have a sunken center 
  - So pieces do nt fall of the edge  rolling dice never get lost and ... Cool points I guess 
- - I work at bestbuy or price match systems were turned off for thanksgiving week . So you re not wrong  but you are nt understanding the whole story .
  - One of the busiest shopping times all year  and they take down price matching  Kind of shitty ...
- - You ca nt wear the headphones reversed because the audio will be reversed
  - the audio is reversed on my sound card so if i wear my headphones reversed  it cancels out . get me 
- - A lot of tin foil hat wearing mother fuckers in here
  - Apparently there s one in here with a bike helmet also .
- - Lately Matthew mcconaughey seems to fill this description . More generally Kevin Spacey  Leo Dicaprio  Benedict Cumberbatch  and Anne Hathaway come to mind
  - I d like to refer you to the Princess Diaries and Bride Wars .
  - They were nt horrible honestly  and most actors have a few bad works under their belt
  - Bride Wars was nt bad      Wtf 
- - These guides are great but it also really depends on what you like too . Start there .
  - I ve been wearing what i like for a while . I really wan na reinvent the whole look so I m open to new ideas
- - Yeah that s pretty obvious . Does nt excuse it though .
  - Of course it does nt  but my point was that this is not on QA  but on loc QA .
- - Discrimination happen when you enslave or persecute a religious minority  not when you have a rigorous protocol of succession inside the royal house .
  - Preferential treatment of any group over any other group is discrimination  regardless of religion  race  gender  orientation  or language . How is that not discrimination 
- - Sounds like a book that Murakami would write .
  - Murakami would also spend pages describing the breasts of every female character in the book .
- - Thats game . Looks like its up to the state of Alabama to restore SEC pride . At least that will be on New Years Day  the games that matter .
  - TBH  for the last decade  it s pretty much always been up to you guys . With the occasional Gator and Geaux
- - If google started making a chewing gun called that I d not be surprised .
  - I would nt care what they called it  but if Google made an edible firearm  I d be very surprised .
- - HIS MOMs FACE IS SOME TITAN LEVEL CREEPY SHIT DUDE ugh i dont like that korosensei left him in that abusive atmosphere .
  - Yeah  that was nt very smart of him
- - Your hatred only makes my socialist boner stronger .
  - LOL  I d love to see that 
- - Oh my god  is that cake  . O
  - Red velvet cake  But they re actually shoes . . D
- - somewhere where we can put our words to be defined on sarcasm with seamus instead of youtube comments cause that place is flooded with shit
  - Unfortunately that s out of our control . There s nothing forcing them to take comments from here which would just cause useless comments . P
- - How do you keep track of who carted and how many times  Does it update and reset automatically 
  - Probably just a text overlay that he updates himself .
- - I had no idea about this till it came in the mail today . Thank you 
  - You re welcome  I usually have no idea either which is awesome 
- - Would it be better to just stand behind it without the ability to take cover . Some is better than none  Amazing game though 
  - Well  crouching in general is better than standing  even out in the open  but that bench as a cover against modern weaponry is pretty much equal to none .
- - Well on the plus side you re cute
  - Ca nt believe I had to scroll this far down to find someone commenting on how attractive this man in the shower is .
- - Can you get the HA fifth Gen starters in this game  What about the second gen ones 
  - Youll eventually get the HA for all pokemon
- - Holy crap  that second one is creepy  First one is kind of attractive  but I like the in-game design better .
  - I actually think the first one is mega creepy and the second one is attractive . The in-game design feels kind of like they took the safe route .
- - Well it s not an real event till Spacely goes dub neg on an important map .
  - Do nt flatter him  he s trip neg

- - What is his company name and where does he export to 
  - Its unlisted  but it exports to the middle east  as per some news reports .
- - Is it only when you wear your headset 
  - No  I tried unplugging it and the static was still there .
- - He s giving away a Stat Kara CW today so rip profit
  - Someone gave that to him to do a giveaway with IIRC
- - Criticism  sure . Flat out attacks  by people motivated to be here in the first place  No .
  - Making attacks could be what s motivating them to be here  no 
- - Thanks for the videos  Hope they re able to help our Guild complete the dungeon 
  - I hope so too  That s why I made them afterall
- - There s an ear in a box in the pilot episode of Boss with Kelsey Grammer . The ear in Hannibal is not in a box  and happens much later .
  - THAT S IT  We have a winner  Boss 
- - These are some weird sounding slow mos .
  - yea im not sure what they re trying to achieve here
- - Does numerology not have a place in conspiracy 
  - Of course it does . This guy seems confused .
- - Give to the homeless . Put it in a big pot  and bring it outside with a hot place or something and give it out .
  - Probably illegal if the OP is in the United States .
- - Great door staff  I ve worked with security who are exactly the same . Is the bar in Soho by chance 
  - Nope  a couple of hours outside of London 
  - It s more than a few hours away from London  but this definitely sounds like something that might happen in Rock City .
  - I ve been there  Rock City s got a grubby  crowded and special place in my heart .
- - To smother myself in butter  bake out in the sun  then finally lick the roasted butter off my hot body . Luke
  - Well it is a goal at least .
- - Yeah  it must be difficult having to get back in a game like this  with so many chances at you .
  - Yeah  they re getting a lot of high scoring shots from the slot
- - Anyone know if it s possible for the whales to see the rainbows they create from their vantage point 
  - I would nt think so . Have you ever seen a rainbow directly over you 
- - I think a team to watch this year who has already Shown they can play is Oregon State .
  - I ve noticed them come up a couple of times this year . I ll have to find a game to watch .
- - All things considered that was a pretty entertaining period
  - Hopefully the canes can get a breath of fresh air this intermission
- - I spent almost a decade in rural North Dakota . Do nt ever go there .
  - Ouch  I think that might be worse than New York .
- - We could use Calderon and Shane Larkin  who could we give up 
  - got any matching expiring contracts  If so  deal .
- - Someone is paying for it  therefore it is not free .
  - It is an investment in the future of our nation . Much likely to receive a better ROI than from what we ve spent blowing up much of the middle east .
- - Did VoG HM last night with it . Made it a lot more challenging .
  - Wow . That takes some doing . Patrol is about my limit . Embarassed myself on a few strikes before that .
- - If they are all legit i would say you have a problem . But if their clones i would say you need more .
  - I wish they were authentic but all clones haha
- - I ve been considering cutting off my penis for sometime now to make me faster .
  - Perhaps you should consider going full Armstrong  I heard it was his massive testicles that held him back ...

  - I ll try to make it more interesting with bolt text next time .
- - Absolutely  but a Google designed speaker  Ca nt we draw the line anywhere with them 
  - Google is nt designing any speakers . They made the Google Cast for audio  technology and speaker manufacturers will incorporate that technology into their speakers .
