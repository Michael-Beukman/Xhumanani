  - Presuming you re correct  what does that tell us 
  - That he chooses to be overly verbose and wear a fedora to feel like he is smart and accomplishing shit .
  - because getting a bachelor s degree in science or mathematics is the only way one can possibly accomplish anything intellectual ...
- - This might be an unpopular opinion but that is a pretty horrible looking watch .
  - I would nt buy it myself either  but for many people it is a matter of prestige .

  - Sadly I do nt think they do . Those dumbass fake reality bullshit tv shows get crazy good ratings and they re cheap to make .

  - If you have RES  you can sort it by new temporarily with just two clicks .

  - I ve never read Dante  but if that s so close to the divine comedy  I welcome the renaming
- - There is a world of difference between Islam as a religeon as lived by the vast majority of Muslims  and Fascism .

  - Would not mind to see the one with an actual face and the slicked back hair though
- - Yes . Most teams were forced to start freshman .
  - Why were most teams forced  you think 
  - There was a nationwide exodus of juniors leaving to the draft . Prestigious programs are being forced to play freshman because there simply is nt as much depth .
  - Yes . I did not consider this .
- - Ah  giving the homeless a home ; therefore  by definition  they are no longer homeless . Genius .

- - I ve been wondering about Lincoln for ever  Why did nt Clarke or Bellamy get Octavia to ask Lincoln about Grounder culture  They seem smarter than that .

- - Fair warning - first video is a dude shooting and killing a moose with a handgun . I definitely neither expected  nor wanted  to see that .
  - I find it interesting that you did nt mention the dude getting stomped to death  but you were bothered by the moose getting shot .

  - Cool idea  I ll work on it 
- - Canada mostly just allows people with high levels of education too  yet still has positive population growth do to immigration .

  - Same  I voted against him but I see that once in a while he is nt a complete train wreck .
- - Am I crazy if I think kadri s line should be first because they actually care about defensive play in our own end

  - Will do  I ve opened Ruby to play but kept Sapphire sealed .
- - Stuff like the wind sword and spiritual stuff like Jinora and Zaheer  air being the element most closely connected with the human mind in most systems .

  - have you ever tried the oreos with chocolate filling  so good

  - Yeah i was just saying the phrase is cliche
- - I would not object to that at all .
  - I think my ears would explode from too much awesome .
- - Do nt you have something better to do 
  - Well  is nt that the pot calling the kettle black .
- - I do nt see how that makes sense . Getting popped for cocaine just means that everyone is going to be looking at his test results .
  - Usually these results are not public tho 
- - It must be difficult to EDC a cutting board .
  - You caught me . Honestly  it s a nice bamboo surface to take a picture on . Looks better than wrinkled bedsheets  or my formica countertop .
- - I ca nt fault anyone for not being able to work with Gamebryo . That engine is fucking awful .
  - It is  but their modified version is a lot better .
- - I ca nt stop laughing at the guy who got the knife . Wtf was he saying 
  - Haha that was my buddy  his mic was a little loud im not too sure .
- - And the fact that Ruby offered to tell the commission what he knew if they brought him back to DC to protect him . Still pisses me off they said no

  - you cant decay lower than silver  so no . it was either bought or he threw .
- - I wish McDonalds had a stand at the forest cause them double cheeseburgers are my hangover cure . I know ... kinda gross but whatever .
  - Anything you could buy from a vendor at EF will help you recover better than any crap you could get from McDonalds
- - The abject lack of MPGIS references on this thread has reminded me that I am not  in fact  on tumblr right now .
  - Tumblr is a void  MPGIS is funny is its own right . Do nt support Tumblr support MPGIS
- - Good to see that his understanding of Orwell is just as rigorous as his understanding of pretty much everything else .
  - Funny how Orwell would absolutely despise this poster  seeing as he was a pretty vocal socialist .
- - Why not flairs to identify what country you re posting from  It would be helpful in providing context to comments .
  - Never tough of that  elaborate please .
- - Had my heart broken earlier today . Nothing like a Warriors win to cheer me up and no better time to get one then with the big Australian back from injury 
  - sorry to hear than man  hopefully the boys pull out a good performance tonight 
- - this makes me more pissy that Snapchat fucked over windows phone users . But I wo nt let one app deter me from the superior OS .

  - Well  sign language is always an option I m so sorry
  - Haha well then if that s the case I need to brush up on my sign language . It s been a few years .
- - Ah  I understand now . I was confused because I thought the prizes for buying the compendium would be exclusive .
  - at first we all feared that it would be asia exclusive but cyborgmatt confirmed that it would be available for all . no worry s there anymore .
- - My old city is seven miles from mex so I know the feeling .
  - It s kind of ridiculous is nt it  Faster to get dope for me than it is do to my grocery shopping . haha
- - Bad luck  You d have to have incredibly good luck  or an overpowered ship  to get through that fight without taking heavy damage .
  - Clarified the post a bit  my ship got blown to pieces  not the enemy . Fight was over with dead crew and no weapons .
- - Did the family decide not to cremate your brother  You had said in an earlier post that  although not your wish  he was going to be cremated .
  - nope not going to cremate him but thank you
- - I m surprised East Asia had any fish left .
  - They do nt have a lot . Japanese fishing ships are travelling ever further from their home waters to compensate for overfishing .
- - Almost bought one  until I saw the interior . Wasnt too impressed ... Ended up in a GTI instead
  - You buy an ST because it s an aggressive performance car  not because the inside looks like a handbag .

  - It s taken down from the App Store . For a good reason too .
- - Nice to see all the people who ruin games for me be so into the game .
  - Well  it s not your fault  right  It s got ta be someone else s fault . It s always someone else s fault .
- - Even in pictures of the second coming  the artist does nt use the description given .
  - That could either be because some Christians read it as figurative language or because the artists are silly . I really do nt know on that one 
- - Where was Bayless tonight  Is he injured or what 
  - They said he had knee soreness or something along those lines .
- - Some games do nt use the ability of the impulse triggers and I m pretty sure that destiny is one of them .
  - Thanks for info  was not aware of this
- - If it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck it s probably a duck .

  - You really ca nt beat the clarks at that price
- - they re terrible in all sorts of ways for society  but for kids they re fun to play on . like no traffic at all
  - Can you expand more on why they are terrible for society  Genuine question .
- - You could be a bit self-deprecating . Say you can not afford to dampen your senses anymore than they already are .
  - Drinking makes one ugly and stupid . I ca nt afford either .
- - Okay man we heard it already a bajillion times  please stop now .
  - I do nt see it posted  It s literally nowhere on the front
- - What culture is your ruler  Also  is that Brittany  Is he a Brenton  Welsh  It should still be Erie if he is Irish .

  - Did you point them toward the flip-flops 
- - Dumbest fucking shit I ve seen in a long time .
  - I am still in shock that they called that play

  - If you read the descriptions of each app review I wrote it tells you how they work .
- - thanks everyone btw does it matter if it s a clone or not  or is that just to say you have a certain brand

  - I did that . And make sure even the phones are set to wifi so he has to go through the wifi to see anything .
- - Jennings better be the Sidebar pic tonight 
  - It ruins the narrative on here of Jennings being horrible though
- - I second this . He is a great developer and I bought all the versions of Springtomize  but sometimes he makes me think that he takes the money and runs .
  - Exactly . Could nt say it better . Epic developer . I ll always support him it s just we need a little more frequent updates
- - Fair enough but in the English language there are no words beginning with gif that have the soft j sound
  - gif is nt even a word . Gi make a j sound as well .
- - One of them is willing to be the DD

- - Started off a little rough but a decent finish
  - And way better now that it s over .

- - As long as it leads to an NHL team  I am all for it .

  - I understand where they re coming from . If you do nt hype up  you re never super sad about a loss . Wins are great
