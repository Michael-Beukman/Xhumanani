- - And here I am  grinning  sitting in my pajamas  and licking the leftover sugar out of my cereal bowl .
  - Who says these guys do nt like sugar too

  - Lmao venting on the Internet is awsome .
- - Not to be that guy  but the purple wedding is technically beyond spoiler scope of a clash of kings .
  - I had guessed that spoilers for Clash of Kings might also include any future events . And Red Wedding is in Clash of Kings . Otherwise it would have been ASOS .

- - Do you have anything else to add to your bio  Like  at all 
  - like appearance ... does he at least look water tribe or does that just amount to nothing
- - I m not even a girl and I can tell you that everybody wants the asian  dude .
  - By asian i assume you are excluding the indian and pakistani crowd . Right 
- - We re not poking terrorists in the face with a stick . You ca nt ignore a stick in your face . You can easily ignore some silly drawings .

- - Good God this game better be better than the Panthers one
  - It ca nt be worse . It ca nt be .

  - Definitely  My brother may know some places as well .
  - Sweet  I ll pm you my contact info
- - He was jumping up to knock the ball and the QB made a stupid floater . Not the defender s fault .
  - You ca nt run through a receiver s back to get to the ball . What do nt you understand about that 
  - His intention was clearly for the ball but whatever .
  - It does nt matter what his intention was . What do nt you understand about that 
- - Make sure to make a poop landing pad with large amounts of toilet paper to avoid the splashback . Nothing like smurf ass

  - A year and a half  but I ve been taking it sporadically . I ve taken several long breaks .
- - I saw the thumbnail and could nt bring myself to watch because I suspect it will make me cringe too hard . How bad is it 
  - No kidding ... how do people like this not see how bad they look  Like seriously .
- - Oh . Yeah . Guess I really should nt do that . Well  I suppose I did nt graduate high school now . Cheers to me .
  - Have you looked into free legal aid clinics in your area  They might be able to help you . Why did nt you get a graduation certificate 
- - SOMETIMES I SUCK MY WEINER INTO MY BALLSAC AND SPIT IT ALL OUT

- - There s a lack of jerome boger hate in here ...
  - Jerome Boger can go suck on a fat one
- - Did Akira Toriyama really did character design for this game 
  - Yup  he did . Did they talk about that in the episode  I do nt remember .
- - What makes him clearly not the creator 
  - On the first link  you can see some French language and the OP says that he plays on NA
- - You would nt want a guy that flings himself into the enemy every other minute being squishy  right  It s just logical .
  - The thing is he really does nt need to . I m really more upset at the other things that riot has nt toned down at all .

  - It s okay  everyone already has OP s Mom s number anyway .
- - Where do you get these obscure games  I m so curious  Milton  Houston  Texas .
  - He s actually answered this in one of his videos . He does nt know  they just show up .
- - Jews of the time kept a fairly routine sabbath  so I m not sure why anyone would think otherwise about early followers of Jesus .
  - Were nt early christians essentially just jews with jesus tacked on .
- - So trion is removing threads that have a negative outlook on the game  or posts that have D E A D G A M E in them .
  - Good ... I m tired of seeing posts from people that have supposedly quit the game and only complain incessantly .
- - Same guy was flaming me for building a necro book on Lycan ... it s just infuriating .
  - My point exactly . Not a single reason to listen to a person this narrowminded and unfamiliar with the game .
- - That looks cool  That pattern would look reaaally nice with gray polish and matte topcoat  I d love that on myself .
  - I agree  If you do that I d love to see it 
- - Pro tip . only trust att as a cell phone provider
  - I ve already got them as a provider . They were the only one that had middle of the lake service back in Greensboro . Helped when lost on small islands .

- - I do nt want him to play it if he does nt want to play it  if he s not invested in the game it ll show in the videos .
  - I completely agree  if he s hating every minute then I do nt want to watch it .
- - That would be a royal Fuck up if the diner was allergic to seafood ...
  - Though  if you have a food allergy like that  you should probably pay a little extra attention to what you are putting in your mouth .
- - God I REALLY wish I could help you
  - Thank you . Just knowing that you wish you could is enough .
- - He never rapped about that of her in his songs .
  - Headlights is actually an apology to his mother  about all the resentment he showed to her .

  - I hid it on purpose so you would nt see it 
- - No  there are many more players who are very very bad at the game .
  - This is all I really wanted to know  thank you

- - Please do nt call yourself vegetarian if you eat fish . - sincerely the vegetarians .
  - please do nt worry about what other people want to call themselves . sincerely  the rest of the world .
- - Charles Johnson was taken WAY too early . What a fucking reach IMO .
  - If you look at his production with Bridgewater in the last part of the season  that s probably where he should be though .
  - It s doubtful anyone will remember him come August . He ll be a late rounder ...
  - People wo nt remember him until they start reading rankings . Experts wont forget him .
- - Being a hawks fan this year is so rewarding .
  - It definitely makes up for those Josh Childress  Al Harrington  Antoine Walker seasons I had to cry myself through .
- - Thank you very much  this is incredibly helpful 
  - Not a problem . Let me know if you have any other questions .
- - If you think that s worse than what Chavez and Maduro have been doing in their literal dictatorship  you re a damn fool .
  - I do nt want to discuss politics with you .
  - Then you should nt have passive-aggressively implied you did want to talk politics .
  - dont waste your time  they can only discuss their religion with single-minded people . theres a chavista forum that bans you for being against the goverment .
- - What for  You can also walk around Mordor  especially the strongholds  and get unlimited Uruks .
  - This takes just the click of a button though
- - The question is  which of your products are nt doing their job - Riot or your ISP 
  - And the answer is Riot ... Other games work fine and everyone on the east coast has ping issues in league  so it s not the ISP s fault .
- - Kissanime is pretty good . They re what I use .
  - Yep  I use that too  . D
- - Ah thanks  I thought they had to be in NA for two seasons for that to work . Is nt that why TSM could nt get another foreign player

- - Damn  you live in a beautiful area at least 
  - Thanks  Yeah I love it here  instant meditation

  - I assumed you meant poison attacks since he said that poison is immune to the poison status effect .
- - Looks like we got a badass over here
  - This daemon guy really knows what he s doing
- - How in the fuck can these people get this much conversation and yet I ca nt even get replies or page views .
  - Obviously you re too much of a nice guy .
- - Streaming is typically aimed at younger gamers . Halos more so targeted toward a slightly older crowd nowadays since its not at its peak of popularity
  - Aimed at the older crowd  I guess that explains all the generic features from other games  overly excited announcer  barrage of medals  and dudebro Spartans .
- - Ramen ... is not healthy ... it s easy ... but it most certainly is nt healthy ...
  - Yeah . This commercial ... everything is wrong about this product . Just wrong .

  - I will try to do a star lord one too
- - Ok  whats with the arenas turning off the lights during intermission  I ve been to a wings game and they did nt do that .

- - Oh sorry I thought ya ment the games store on your xbox
  - That s the Microsoft store  is it not 
- - I m open to learning . Want to teach me

  - The rear wing is commonly known as a spoiler it is for down force rear spoilers do increase drag .
