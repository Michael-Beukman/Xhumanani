  - Seconded Destiny needs to be played while it still has a playerbase  so it s best to do so now .
- - I thought Pam was addicted to coke again but now that she is fat  it did nt make sense .

  - I know its bad  I regret it . But I ca nt go back . I just needed to tell someone . I feel .
- - Well which one is it . disappointing or horrible  You ca nt both because they contradict eachother Edit . nevermind I misread your title
  - Okay I guess your one of the ones who liked it by the look of your handle . Yea disappointed is what I was going for .
- - you are right  it is an oops .

  - Yeah  eggs get vulnerable when your load is nt strapped .
- - You might have to open some ports for CoD .
  - I opened them all . I m open on PC but closed on xbone
- - I was wheezing with laughter at the first task .
  - I read this some time ago  and was reading it at my desk at work at lunch  and had to STOP because I could nt stop laughing ...
- - How do I help  What do I answer 
  - There are some google forms about movies  . D
- - I saw four Pits in a TRU in the same town yesterday . If you re still looking for a Pit  try the small towns .
  - Good advice . I ll try that . Thanks amiibro
- - The movie was not that good . Leaves alot out from the book .
  - I m shocked  a movie does nt manage to keep everything from the book 
- - Which victorinox do you plan to get 
  - Huntsman wood handle . I love natural grips .

  - Oh my god you are right  this can be so badly misinterpreted

  - It looks great from afar  but you can still make out the printing if you look at it closely in person .
- - Where can I get a good navy OCBD  preferably one with off white buttons 
  - I think Gant Rugger has a indigo OCBD . You might get more finds with the indigo than navy .
- - Why didnt you pick it up for him ...  Would ve been safer
  - yes the idea was to make it faster . and so it was
- - At least they wont be as gimped as DIG s botlane . Even without communication problems  Corejj still has kiwi as his support .
  - Alan is trying to stop sucking god dammit .
- - Can we get a list of the mods 
  - The reason OP s do nt give mod lists is when it s not original content .
- - Are they  Maybe he s just doing it wrong then ... Candidly I do nt know much about locks atm .
  - Yeah  I ca nt speak for PvE . But affliction is in a good spot for PvP .
- - They still have yet to name the driver . Is nt this unusual 
  - Probably to stop people from hassling him .
- - Ohai  you re cheerleader girl from the other thread . Stop being so pretty  Jerk .
  - Stop being so sweet  you re makin me blush
- - You did nt like the ending  Why 
  - I think most people find the literal deus ex machina ending to Las Vegas to be clumsy . It s one of my favorite novels  but that scene is cringe-inducing .
- - Some people were calling for him to sit out another year .
  - That s crazy talk  its not like he got caught in a rented vehicle with weed and an unregistered handgun in the vicinity .
- - and how do either get the tens of millions who have neither and buy on price alone 
  - if they thought sales were driven on price alone MS would not have launched with theirs so high and kept it that way for so long .
- - Um  when will it be back open again  Does anyone know 
  - Please see the sidebar for the closest schedule we have .
- - Or  leave them in a desert . That might be more effective

  - Thank you for informing me of that . I deleted the other one as this better articulated my goals .
- - I ve bought a bunch of eshop games this year . How do I find the codes

  - Check in the menu when in the eshop . I can look and find specifics later if you need .
- - Ya  the creepiness factor of Adnan is really high .

- - Are they saying it s more moral to be fat 
  - You can always trust a fat man  Unless he s a programmer named Dennis on an island theme park ...
- - ok thx for the info  guess I did miss it then when I was trying xD

- - you realize that some of us have jobs . that we have to go to the store and buy food to bring home and cook  right 
  - Hmm yes  very interesting  well done on having a job and all  but you ve missed the point .
- - but if you only use one combo through the game  you wo nt get the small snippets of information about the people inside transistor . O
  - unless you already have done that beforehand .
- - Oh yeah it looks like they might ve made some changes . When did you order yours 
  - Black Friday . My one with holos should hopefully be at my dorm when I go back to college
- - Strong source . Probably the equivalent of a signed napkin in a pub as far as credibility goes .
  - so this is actually happening    
- - He s got a point . Look at the sales of smash bros in comparison to games that are primarily competitive .
  - You can slap smash brothers on to anything and get mass sales .
- - I assume you are referring to me 
  - Indeed . Put it in the wrong place .
- - She can also negate stiches hook . You see the animation  you hear the sounds but she just vault away with the hook sticked to her .
  - Feels like when Ezreal e s Blitzcrank s hook
- - I meant that GGA require players to stream . Of course GGA gives salaries  they have probably the best salaries in esports atm .
  - Ah sorry for the misunderstanding there . P yeah thats true
- - Are you looking for a Crusher or Granite Crusher to buy 
  - Only looking for the regular . Just wanted to be sure . Thanks .
- - There are no new polls . The records have merely been updated to reflect bowl wins and losses .
  - Yup  new AP comes after the NCG .
- - Why all this Japanese hate  I find the tanks to be great sniping and support vehicles . They just do nt brawl well .
  - They do nt really snipe well either  is the problem .
- - Private trackers are the way to go . For public trackers  there are seedboxes  but it ll cost you .
  - Forgive my ignorance - How exactly do you use private trackers  What differentiates private vs public trackers 
- - This seems like the kind of stuff that a recruiter at a bank would want to see . Transferable skills .

  - Ha yeah . But I have nt been on twitter for ages
- - Thanks  this is the first time I ve made a video like this . And yeah  I did nt get to put in RvB or Social Disorder .

  - Came here to say this  most logical solution . Good luck OP 
- - Strange how well that fit  nice job .
  - That song fits well with superhero movie trailers . When my friend was underwhelmed with the first Man of Steel trailer I mixed it with that song and he loved it .

- - I do  but does it count if I have nt started my break yet  Just another Monday
  - If you have nt started a break you ca nt really go back  can you 
- - Maybe they re experimenting to see if Hein can handle it solo . Maybe he wants to try it all by himself .

  - This maybe it I have vomited from swallowing the smoke . Try not to inhale for so long when you take a toke
- - Ancient Egyptian family members shaved their eyebrows in mourning when the family cat died .
  - Cats respond better to women than to men  probably due to the fact that women s voices have a higher pitch .
- - And when shuffling do nt sound right .
  - That is a harder one as sleeves can also alter it .
- - Cosmos . Both . Carl s Sagan s and the new season by Neil dg Tyson .
  - Oh hell yes  Each episode of the new series was so epic 
- - Hashtag liberal narcissism . Having personal racist views is not illegal and he has the right to not want to watch Chinese teams play .

- - No one EVER knows that story . I fucking love Swift .
  - really  i see it referenced here a lot here

- - I think the point he s making is that Smash ca nt only be about the competitive side .
  - But ... It wo nt be long until all the casual players get bored and ditch it  then who ll be left to play it 
  - Smash ca nt revolve solely the casual group of players either . Otherwise it might as well be a cell phone game that people play for a week and move on .
  - And therein lies the problem . A lot of the game revolves around casual play  this leaves very  very little room for any competitive nature .
- - Great thank you so much for answering

  - The bad guy in sonic boom is named lyric and that s what they were playing .
- - Correct me if I m wrong  but I m pretty sure there are no purple cosmos in the game o.O
  - You re right  I always confuse pansies and cosmos . I meant purple pansies .
- - I m not on the Bobby train  either . Boy needs to sit down and shut up .
  - Ah I do nt mind him as such but  this is really petty  his teeth really bug me ... I find them really distracting .

  - Those are nt official yet and should ve been in the game years ago .
  - Still shows that they re trying big things .
- - Was nt meant to be taken serious .
  - No  uh  that s just not what a ganker is  exactly
