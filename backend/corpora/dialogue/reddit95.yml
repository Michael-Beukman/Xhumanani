- - I lived in that area for two years and loved it .
  - I love it  It s quiet and not completely urban .

  - I would love to have Frost come back to the map pool  I miss that map so much

  - Exactly  except they do nt know they re naked .

- - Chief is one of the biggest homer commentators  but man do I love him since he does nt give a fuck and says what he wants
  - And yet  people hate Jack for the exact same reason D .
  - Notice it s a Tampa fan that said they love him . And it s Bruins fans that love Jack .
  - Notice there are nt raging circlejerk threads when Chief makes a controversial call .
  - Could also be that Tampa is a smaller market than Boston so there s fewer that know about Chief .
  - Also because Edwards is absolutely batshit insane and loses his cool regularly .

  - I do nt know how you can say that . It s pretty damned cool .
- - He may have known that Rodgers was behind him  but he might not have realized he was stepping on him until it was too late .
  - But his reaction does nt support that . There was no reaction of surprise . No visual evidence suggests it was anything but intentional .
- - Do you skip leg day when you workout  I do nt want to sound cruel  but you should be able to get up higher than that .
  - Nope . The cyclist in me might skip upper body  but never leg day .

  - Thank you  I know it s still not perfect  and I assure you I will continue to improve it until it is .

  - Downloaded it recently . Hopefully it wo nt be a waste . Looks like there ll be a Guster concert hosted on Screen this month 
  - They do live concerts almost every night .
  - Looked through them as soon as I downloaded the app  but Guster was the only one I recognized .
- - that was my first thought too . Who would have that kind of info that early besides insider 
  - But why would they need someone to buy them a VIP ticket  unless they were kidding .
- - There is no way in hell were signing a DM . This guy we ll do for Wenger
  - Chances of signing a DM this window were always negligible unless a team really needed the money .

  - Beware the long grass . Snakes freak me out .
- - We ll help you reduce that number by one if you like .
  - There I was thinking you were happy with Bertrand . I guess we ll take him back I suppose .
  - In all seriousness  do you see Chelsea recalling him at the end of the season  I d bloody love to sign him .
  - Pretty sure he ll be joining you in the summer  I think it s what Bertrand wants as well at this point .
- - This is an interesting find  and I d also be interested to see what other animals gauge risk by distance  instead of speed .
  - Most of them  I d guess . There are nt many predators or dangers that travel at highway speeds in perfectly straight lines .
- - At least level Black Hammer up to the first perks since IB is good out of the box .
  - Sounds like a plan  I can just swap them out as necessary too  I suppose . Infinite ammo 
- - Better question . Do we think the return of Sam Bradford will make anyone but Quick viable 
  - I think he has the potential to  but it will be fairly dependent on the OC and how the offense will run .
  - Would you rather have a guy like quick or Bruce Ellington 
  - I would rather have Quick but a pretty significant amount .
- - as a jug tank i think this may be my favorite patch ever
  - Nobody in my guild wanted to take along my Sith Jugg  lets see if it changes .
