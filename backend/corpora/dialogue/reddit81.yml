  - She prefers to be labelled a woman  yes .
- - I wonder what Fitzgerald thinks about cheese ... hhmm .
  - I m hoping he s a fish man  myself .

- - I m a Packers fan that lives in Chicago ... You re damn right I hate the bears .
  - Too bad we hated ourselves even more this season . So ha 
- - DId you watch the vine at all 
  - Did you look at his image at all 
- - Can you pls teach me how to chem
  - i have my textbook in front of me right now so yes i can
- - I have nt lived in WA outside Seattle  but I can say that traffic law enforcement here is abysmal compared to every other place I ve lived .
  - Just head up to Shoreline  The cops there have nothing better to do than hand out speeding tickets .
- - Love those panties  would clean you right up
  - If you finish me off you better clean up 
- - Had a truly delicious breakfast of scrambled eggs  coffee and toast this morning .
  - YUM . I love all of that .
- - Squatting parallel that many times has to destroy your knees - braces or not . I do nt blame the guy at all for not going parallel . His DL is sick
  - Myths perpetuated by the weak to make excuses for themselves .
- - Lol I really appreciate it and def plan to get a little work down on the brows . I have just always been afraid of getting too much taken off .
  - As someone whose brows were butchered at a young age and never fully grown back  take caution . I think you look great .
- - What model of modem are they providing 
  - I have tried changing the client lease time is the DHCP settings but now my wireless is being extremely slow . I m currently on hold with my ISP .
- - On vita its unicorn horn and moms perfume
  - Well  that s pretty disappointing for you .
- - HACKSAW  MY BALLS ARE SO HARD UNIVERSITY
  - SEE A DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY  GO RAVENS 
- - Love that . Where d you get it  Do they have a men s version 
  - It s on the Panthers website . And yes  there s a men s version .
- - I actually knew this one already  It s one of my favorites .
  - You have a great taste in jokes then . p
- - Who is that  I know absolutely nothing about college football .
  - He probably means Patriots DT Alan Branch .
- - I can yell at you if you want  I am of the belief that people can think what ever they want
  - Can you please  And perhaps throw in an insult aimed at my sexual orientation or mother 
- - Hey do nt knock Pokemon ... The sky pillar on a touch screen is nt as easy as it sounds . I d rather emulate on a PSP lol .

  - Only if you were born with a vagina
- - I  too  read that Cracked article this morning .
  - My friend actually told me this morning . I guess he reads cracked .
- - Who the FUCK had the Balls to stay and record 
  - The guy behind the camera  who is having a seizure while recording
- - You re cute  What a pretty family .
  - Thank you  Last time I posted pics here  I was told I look like Hank Green .
- - I do nt think he s going anywhere  do nt worry . He just got promoted .
  - Yea stay away Philly  Why would he want a new job after getting promoted anyways 
- - What s wrong with TRP s position that if you want to debate  go to PPD  and do nt stir up drama on the main sub 
  - Well that s why I m here . Again  it s well within their right to ban whoever they want and I do nt know anyone who d argue otherwise .
- - the magic was unexpected but a goal shouldve been the result either way . Pelle was wide open for an easy goal
  - If he d stayed in his goal it might well have been different though  Man would have been forced inside where there were more players .
- - I m against this  especially as time periods get shorter and shorter . However  other people are more than welcome to provide their thoughts and input .
  - I think that major migrations  like that of the Vandals to Africa  should be allowed if they give up a certain amount of expansions or something .
- - this title is a lie . a lie I tell you 
  - Truly  there is no such thing .
- - The sweet potato apple soup sounds intriguing . . o
  - It s insanely good  I ve made so much and it lasts forever and I m in love with it .
- - That s a weak prank if you consider that a prank .

- - My brothers cat will do this . She has balls . She ll actually steal stuff right off your plate if you re not watching it .
  - My cat does this too . He ll jump on the table and try to stick his face in our food while we re eating .
- - That little bit of hair is sexy as hell
  - I prefer lots of hair  my Korean gf does nt shave down there and it s sexy as hell and looks a lot more natural .
- - Why do some of cylindrical packages in front have Osama Bin Laden s face on them 
  - The man has a reputation for quality explosions .
- - Is the goal to secure the gun to make it difficult to impossible to steal  or is it simply to keep curious kids from getting to the gun 
  - I will lock my door to my room everyday so its mostly just to keep it out of sight and slightly secured
- - Sending the Captain from the ship is not recommended  was surprised they had no decent point defense . Love the observer reaction .
  - If their main weapons are railguns  there s no point to point defense . You ca nt really shoot down a solid metal slug .
- - Is there any kind of resource for understanding how long it takes tires to warm up 
  - Short answer  no  too many variables . I have used a seek thermal camera mounted on my phone to thermal image my tires .
- - In my experience it really works and successfully avoids motion sickness for me .
  - Same here  implemented it in a project and complaints went down by a huge amount .
- - You ca nt exactly get published for saying the Nicene Creed .
  - Well  from what I have seen  they would not even believe that it actually existed  based on the manuscript evidence .
- - I ve seen them come disengaged when removing the trans from the old engine . Just something to check .
  - Is there an easy way for me to check that  Just incase
- - Aesthetically it s perfect  but the million dollar question is  how does it vape 
  - Also  it s not really perfect  the wraps could have been a bit cleaner . I really do try to make them look as nice as possible though .
- - RIP Stuart Scott . My mother is going through the same kind of cancer now  I hope hers turns out better
  - what kind of cancer did he have 
- - ITT . Formerly fat and skinny people .
  - Formerly fat people would still know the daily problems  even if they do nt have to deal with them anymore .
- - Come on ECU ... Do not let the Gator offensive line block you all the way back to Greenville
  - No  let them . They can even Gator Chomp every time we score like they ve been doing .
- - something weird about this . Looks like a false flag to me .
  - Then  uhh ... why post it 
- - Well at night I can imagine it d be near impossible  but during the day maybe it s a different story . Wishful thinking 
  - There s a good reason why so many cars get hit at crossings ... sadly ...
- - The texture is most definitely lighter in reds  we have much more trouble with pest pressure in the reds as their leaves are not as robust .
  - Maybe that s it  I prefer my lettuce crispy  not floppy  Either way  I only buy green .
- - Easy solution . Release it on Xbox first .
  - Which devs obviously do nt want to do . Meanwhile  the other console and steam will blow up with indies .
- - I fixed it up  OP has new version  thanks for the tip with the missing e  too .
  - and missing n. edit . nvm you got it 
- - Yeah  I think it would be good if they broke down how the players goals were scored I.e right foot  left foot header etc .
  - That would nt be bad for player stats . In general  I wish stat tracking was much better on FUT .
- - Easier solution  learn how to make holy water .
  - Do nt forget about the salt . lots and lots of salt . plus more salt .
- - French free  Now I m hungry .
  - Stop sympathizing with the terrorists  It s called Freedom free .
- - That is awful . It is frightening to see the websites facade when juxtaposed with you story . Thanks for sharing your story . We need to keep the stories alive .
  - Thank you  these people definetley put on a good face
- - you are right on the keep them alive part  but as you already noticed makes you torturing them as bad as them .
  - Bullshit . They ve killed innocent people  and something tells me you have nt . At this point they ve lost their humanity and right to be treated equally .
- - You should encourage this behavior . It s cool when kids are excited about learning .
  - Agreed  encourage the hell out of this OP 
- - Wait why would we trade him  He s been nothing short of solid for us
  - I do nt think the OP s question is whether we SHOULD trade him  they re just asking about value .
- - guess i better go read rediquette  does it say it s good to call people flaming douche s  lol  jk
  - lol actually I think I went against rediquette on that . I should probably read up as well .
- - If their last name is Griswold  that s all I care about . Because that s my last name 
  - it is  Ed Helms plays Rusty .
- - Yeah I was just waiting for Dim Sun to post something . I think Friday should work .
  - Sorry I only just woke up . I think that ll be fine .
- - Holy shit  how would that be considered acceptable 
  - Because money . They stilll have to use PLEX which someone bought to subscribe .
- - That boy all the way on the right looks nervous as hell .
  - Well  we could easily have pushed one another into the lake . Plus  we had swords . They are my brothers .
  - It looks like he s the only unarmed one . He ca nt even defend himself . D .
  - I think his sword was back at the campsite  or his mom may have been holding it . We were all armed throughout much of our stay .
- - Watch something with James Deen in it . He might change your mind about how you view male pornstars . Total ladyboner .
  - He s not that hot . Like he s hot compared to the average pornstar  yes  but I do nt think he s remarkable .
- - They did nt take over the embassy they breached the wall  big difference with the same result as everything else they did . Just stunts that failed everywhere .
  - I m guessing you re one of those we never lost a battle in Vietnam  nutcases .
- - Less than a billion ... I mean I know he was making a hyperbole  but how cool would having MAG level of players in a match be 
  - It would have to be called LAG instead .
- - Dude . Always fuck the Jets . No exceptions .
  - Right  Those motherfuckers knocked us out of the playoffs twice . And Woody is trying to get Revis back . HE S OURS .
- - I realize now . Bad choice of words .
  - I m sure  it just tickled me a little .
- - Yeah it s been happening since day one 
  - We always knew he was a closeted United fan . Agent Gerrard deliberately slipped that day .
- - What if he could design a robot that would solve all relationship problems for him  I think that solution would work pretty well  once it s implemented .
  - In order to build a robot capable of solving all relationship problems  one must first be able to solve all relationship problems .
- - Your sentence does not make any sense . I am feeling a language barrier .
  - Sorry about that . I was inquiring as to what the penalty for intent to incite is if there are no religious or other hate related aspects .
- - Mi Pueblo in Venice . I have nt been there in years  but I have never been to a better Hispanic restaurant outside of Miami .
  - I went there and wasnt impressed . More like tex mex and i thought the food was bland amd flavorless .
  - Really  Man  the times have changed then . I live in Cape Coral now and just hit Iguana Mia .
  - I have heard good things about that place . Will have to drive down and check it out .
- - I do nt recall a dessert rose but it sounds delicious .
  - thanks for pointing out the typo in a relatively non dickish way .
- - You will have to reset one of the quests to a different status level . Google can help you  but it will still take some experimentation .
  - That s what I m trying to avoid ... I guess NPC s could turn hostile based on a quest variable .
- - Sweet  some new Bino now AND the announcement later tonight  
  - That s what my first thought was too 
- - The keeps would ve saved it if it had nt been half time .
  - Yeah more than likely but it s not the point  should nt be blowing for half time in an attacking position
- - Just a hunch  but I suspect we might see better QB play in this game than the previous . Do nt know why  call it a gut feeling
  - Flacco and Roethlisberger decide to sit this one out . Gradkowski vs. whoever the duck is the Ravens backup  Get pumped 
- - ITT . We have the same conversations our parents did  and their parents did .
  - What s worse is we never seem to actually learn anything . We just keep talking about it all xD
- - And you care what others think why 
  - If they re cocky enough to complain to you then you can educate them . Is everyone there paranoid now 
- - I am strangely defensive about chock full O nuts .
  - Are lots of people bashing Chock full o  Nuts these days 
- - I have nothing against recreational drug use  but I just do nt feel the need .
  - That s the way it should be . If you need them  it s a problem
- - I have been looking at the AR for awhile . Why are you selling it  Price pic 
  - I ll get a pic in a min . I do nt know what I was thinking when I posted this last night .
- - One day ... One day blizzard will finally notice Arms Warriors .
  - I wish they did nt notice WW monks .
- - It s not actually that lumpy . I think you should have been able to figure that out just by the fact that that picture is from tumblr .
  - Yeah  I was gon na say  tumblr does nt really ... you know ... fact check .
- - Pfft best item as the Lost is Ipecac  everyone knows that
  - Best to use it with Guppy s collar but not nine lives
- - I would say it can be held as belief  but not as dogma .
  - I think that s a great way to put it . Going to steal it .
- - Flacco just tripped over his elite dragon dick . That s all .
  - He stepped on his balls  as you can see on the replay  he did nt even flinch .
- - Go to a techno party  take some MDMA and your body will know what to do .
  - This is how i learned how to dance to hip hop
- - that creepy ass lab coat looks way too white and clean to have sat there for a while .
  - It was cleaner than I expected but it did have some mildew  you can tell in the first picture . I used flash in the second
- - ctf fits just as much as this mode .
  - Well  i m not saying it fits better  but at least CTF has teams  while this one here does nt
- - I see you everywhere dude . Is this like  the main game you play 
  - yep pretty much the only game i play right now ... titanfall has ruined other games for me  in both a bad and good way . P
- - Amazon rules allow sellers to give away product in exchange for reviews . See the program Vine or many of the prominent reviewers out there .
  - Does nt sound like he was giving them away . More like selling them cheap to one of those professional companies that give you reviews for discounts .
- - The easiest thing to do is to just ... get Yosemite . What s preventing you from upgrading 
  - OP obviously wants to run a stable OS
- - Do you get a shiver down your spine when that thing is a perfect fit 
  - If by shiver you mean cum in my pants then yes .
- - Could distributing the pictures be construed as an incitement to hatred under Irish Law 
  - IANAL but I do nt think distribution alone would do it . The intent behind it or any message attached to it would be considered .
- - I ve been a wreck since I was born  I m honestly convinced the world would ve been better off if I was a miscarriage instead .
  - Bullshit . We only get one shot  dont waste yours .
- - As Darth Vader  I would use my clairvoyance to find and kill all the terrorists .
  - Did nt work out so well for him  though .
- - You played runescape for the immersion factor 
  - Yes  I enjoyed the dungeons and dragons theme
- - Why not just try to make it better  It really is a shame that this build should look like this when it cost so much .
  - Some people just want performance ... although then he should have gotten a closed case ... who knows
- - If you re stumbling and smell of liquor I do nt need a damn breathalyzer and neither do the state troopers .
  - You do nt work at a shop do you 
- - I thought you were asking in general why information would be classified .
  - I am . That s not why information is classified .
- - So many known actors  I dont know who s going to be main characters 
  - Dr. Venture is back     
- - Tell him to move to So Cal and buy an In N Out .
  - You ca nt franchise in-n-out  it s a family run business .
- - I like the addition of the banana  have an up vote
  - Wow ... I did nt even notice the banana until you pointed it out . Thanks 
- - Except it is nt and there was no proof for those claims  which were made by the IDF and the IDF alone .
  - Making statements like this is equivalent to holocaust denial . There s mountains of evidence to show that hamas is actively attacking israel .
- - Also  I feel like a dick sitting and watching TV whilst someone works for me in the other room
  - He s getting paid mate  you should nt feel guilty .
- - What are you talking about  For what body was it chosen as the international language 
  - It s the international language in aviation .
- - Yeah . Just look at all these new people buying .
  - So many new people are buying  the price is continuing to drop  This is a good thing 
- - Do tell how you have proof he was carried .
  - Guessing that he s assuming that his numbers were subpar ... Which even if he s good they would be pretty low .
- - Have India announced a vice captain yet 
  - I thought it was Ishant  so i m confused now .
- - Way to put words in his mouth .
  - What part did I put in his mouth 
- - Im in the very small minority of people that like Jerry .
  - I ve seen lots of people say they really like Jerry Jones the owner but until recently Jerry Jones the GM made some interesting decisions
- - Do nt know if this has been mentioned recently but whats happening with fantasy LCS is it happening this season 
  - Why would it not  It was really successful
- - I do nt really know what the point of posting this was .
  - Seems like spam honestly  also looks like OP s account was deleted or something
- - So the past two games I ve gone to was the game against the Chiefs last year and this game . Am I good Luck 
  - Everybody  chip in and get this man a trip to Denver .
- - Confident stupidity . I d have a hard time not punching him in the face .
  - Would nt happen . By the time you swung your fist he would have already walked away .
- - wow  two different worlds . In most of Europe being Atheist is the default . being overly religious is what i consider strange
  - This is true of the Pacific Northwest as well . Though other forms of mysticism are popular  such as astrology and homeopathy  the majority is atheist in my experience .
- - How am I fear mongering  You just admitted yourself the street harassment sucks . Why visit Egypt when you can visit a country where they actually respect women 
  - Because he also said it happens in every big city  which it does . So are you saying women should only live in the suburbs 
- - Only pretentious assholes would judge someone based on how they tie their tie . Are you a pretentious asshole 
  - Nope  I tie my tie like everyone else .
  - There are a variety of ways to tie a tie . Which one makes me not a pretentious asshole 
  - Windsor  maybe a double windsor . Not a trinity . But feel free to tie your tie however you want . It makes it easier to identify people like you .
- - Yeah it s stitched  I finally took a look at the jersey last night .
  - Oh lol I forgot about this . Okay  thanks dude .
