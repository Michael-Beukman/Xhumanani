  - Exactly  except I enjoy his videos and stream .
- - It s more along the lines of they wont get our money until we re sure the game is in a working state .
  - Then pre-ordering is nt the problem . You can still pre-order and wait a couple days to pick it up or cancel it .

- - That s just the aspect ratio of that screen . no problem 
  - Thanks  I guess I done fucked up
- - No  we can be fairly certain they re making this shit up . Anyone with decent critical thinking skills could determine that .
  - But how do you know that for certain  What are decent critical thinking skills and how do they enable you to know a person better than they know themselves

  - You re probably right  I can be a dick sometimes .
- - Is John Carter really that bad  Would I enjoy it if I watched it with no expectations

  - Sorry  in retrospect it does seem pointless to say yes to the OP but not give a name . I swear I was nt trying to be annoying haha
- - So does anyone think Burkman will win  Lombard is a beast .
  - You never know . But I have Lombard of course . He may shock us all though .

- - but it does nt even apply . he did nt have a counterpoint at all  he was just plain wrong
  - I know it does nt apply  I just think that image is great . It would have been better if it was relevant  but still . I like it .

- - You still hold it against me that you got BTFO by half of ghazi .
  - I do nt hold anything against you but for my sanity I must refrain from being friendly with you .
  - So I drive people insane  Glad to know
  - I do nt know about other people but in my case  I m simply taking precautions .
- - Is that a fat suit or is that her actual body 
  - I think it s mostly her actual body with possibly some fat added . She s a hamplanet .
- - Nail biting . I once tried that shit you put on your nails to make them taste gross . I fought through the misery . I should go on Fear Factor .
  - I grew to like the stuff my parents used for me  but I think it may have just been pepper
- - It s his life  he can live or die the way he wants .

  - What do you mean by that  Was nt he on Charlotte and Milwaukee for the whole season last year 
- - It s moreso libertarian than Left Wing I believe ...

  - They did nt get invited  they got second in the qualifier that HellRaisers won and got the invite after they dropped out .
- - Why Is The First Letter Of Each Word In The Title Capitalized 
  - Because that s how you write a title in English .

- - do you have another power supply you can test with 
  - Not at the moment  might be borrowing my friends tomorrow .
- - I m Floridian so it s always hot and humid haha . I do nt really sweat so I just go with my usual routine .

- - That picture needs to be replaced with a flat screen  Then he d be ready 
  - Hes workin on it . Got ta convince the Mrs .
- - That s not even an issue that the majority of modern day feminist face ... This is why many POC look at the feminist movement and think wtf .
  - Because clearly we ca nt solve multiple issues at once  right  EDIT . That was sarcasm . SARCASM .
- - This is partly because the show was heavily criticised for the hindsight on real news aspect .
  - Then just have them make mistakes on the real news ; why they d abandon the premise like that is beyond me .
- - and now you know what it s like to truly be PCMR
  - one more day . this weekend gon na be epic .

  - I do nt think OP would be comfortable with a protein shake .
- - You should probably read up on Ancient Greece  pal .
  - How dare you let science and historical fact get in the way of political ideology

  - The US is powerful but they are not that powerful .
- - It was a retaliation attack . The asian was with a group of kids that beat up one of the kids in the video .
  - yeah lets repeat bullshit facts we heard on the internet as if they re the truth

  - i m with you on this  it just looks a little awkward
- - Awesome finds  I always hope that my local pawn shops would have that  because not a lot of people realize how valuable an old sports game can be .

- - Even with just the sheer numbers  it s fairly likely . I feel so sorry for the kid .
  - I feel sorry to but im hopeing they rise above the pit thier family is in and lives a good life
- - You have to pull the AI memory boards .
  - Pull the memory boards Each memory board controls a different part of the AI  take whichever ones you want
