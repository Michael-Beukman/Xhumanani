  - I think it sounds good . It has a little bit of surface noise between tracks  but its not noticeable when its playing .
- - We must ve watched a different movie . I watched a painful disease eventually drive two people apart over a couple decades .
  - The whole point was that the movie did nt address the truth  according to his wife s memoir .

  - And on second April EA takes every single player we pulled on first April away from us

  - FIFA is serious business and anyone who says differently has nt suffered the pain of losing coins lol .

- - My old range safety officer would stroke the fuck out watching this video .
  - I was waiting for this video to show up here . Safety violator 
- - Well ... there is one and only one key number you must know . Another hint  some of the numbers in the code are fluff 
  - So the key number indicates where the fluff spaces are 
- - Except the UK and France could import resources from overseas  which they did massively . Germany  however  was blockaded by the Royal Navy .
  - Look up meat grinder with reference to WWI . Aside from being debt rattled at this point  they were both running out of warm bodies to feed .

  - Maybe she s just clarifying that she s just one person

  - Well  if you re dead  you would nt really remember being murdered ...
- - I like wearing mine with plaid flannel  the textures play together nicely .
  - This too  such a comfy combo .
- - So much detail for N. I keep studying the picture and swearing it s HO . Actually being able to see specs of dust is the true giveaway .
  - Most defiantly N scale . Could take a pic of it next to a pencil or ruler or something .
- - Why do you have things to do late game  What archetype are you playing 
  - I assume he means hard casting the SDE s that he was supposed to be ramping into .
- - I heard he was once a child  too .
  - He exited the womb as a full grown man  man uggs and all

  - Seconded . This show is a gem .
- - That s normal  just do nt stand there like an idiot and get down .
  - He s not an idiot for not expecting a totally unforeseen bug to kill him . There s absolutely no indicator of this happening .

  - Right  I was kinda taken back by it
- - I m not implying you re complaining  just continuing the conversation .
  - Lol  not implying that you were implying I was complaining either . D just stating my opinion haha

- - Seeing that it does nt really effect gameplay  i do nt think its the highest priority right now
  - Obviously . I meant it as a possible addition in the future . I personally enjoy additional content .
- - Good Lord  you re a lot of fun . I bet you get invited back to parties all the time .
  - Well this was nt a situation where I had any intention of being fun . You incorrectly gave out information and I corrected that .
- - Too bad we ca nt go for both ...
  - Forma drop in the Void all the time  dude .
- - I m Vesper Evans . I m in Hufflepuff . What class are you teaching 
  - Nice to meet you Vesper . I m Professor Jackson  the new Charms teacher .

  - Well yes . It really is quite terrible  Miss  because the older students are the same way .
  - You re a first year  are nt you

- - I m desperate for a Beach Slang full length . I think they re the band I most anticipate material from .
  - I ve never listened to them before . I m guessing they are good . Who do they sound like 
- - Can you be a little more specific  Does the knobs or faders on your DAW react to your physical inputs on the controller 
  - Nvm I figured it out . Thanks for your response . Sorry for the trouble
- - Another trollx checking in and sending hugs . You can make it through this 
  - Thank you . This is my first time posting to trollY and I was nt expecting a response like this ... Thank you guys
- - It is accurate . Which is all the more frustrating . Do movies emulate real life or do people emulate what they see in movies  Probably both .
  - To be fair people generally stay and fight instead of running away and wondering
- - I know that used to be a common practice but I thought Yosemite and the Big Wall community had cleaned things up and made this an unacceptable practice .
  - Its not like where they are gets much traffic . They probably still shouldnt have but its more important to avoid on routes that are heavily used .
- - Yoshi Island is always one of the top games at AGDQ
  - I missed it last year . Am glad I did nt this year .

- - Hey I installed dream board on Cydia but no app appeared on my home screen  any idea why 
  - Some people said it was nt updated but I thought it was .
- - Man  that is NOT how I remember him  When you re a kid though  those things get by you 
  - that is so freaking wrong . you destroyed that movie for me now . my childhood is RUINED  may the nothing consume u all 
- - Okay  so  give me a few days and I ll put together a tutorial for everyone  I m happy to see so many positive responses 
  - Thank you so much for being willing to do this  They are SO beautiful

  - I can confirm this image has been altered  those green lines are created by photo editing software .
- - I wanted to become famous just so I could be interviewed by Craig . That s probably not going to happen now . That makes me very sad .
  - I wanted go to LA just so I could get tapped on a shoulder .
- - The difference in the heel drops between both shoes might be messing with you .
  - What is a heel drop exactly  I ve only recently started to actually read things about running  but before that I just put on my bargain shoes and ran .
- - Has this been confirmed from another source 
  - I ve heard this same claim repeated on the BBC news channel . This was just the first article I saw that mentioned it .
- - This also happened to me  except it was from a teammate getting out of his and it continued to blast forward ... right into me
  - So it did nt happen to you then  as you did nt run yourself over and you were nt sent to orbit because of it 
- - Did you accidentally flash the Verizon version of the rom 
  - ya i realised i accidently flashed the verizon version of twrp  nbd just reflashed
- - I m so glad to see you here 
  - Glad to see you too  I see a couple of people I recognize  Awesomeness 
- - Well  all of a sudden I find myself as a Galaxy fan and now I ll actually pay attention to the MLS .
  - As in look up how they are doing every other week .
- - I will definitely research some Chinese while making this decision .
  - I ve heard that it s a very easy language to learn as it s so logical .
- - well considering this is actually a song with vocals  this probably was nt hard to make .
  - well considering they re talented  this probably was nt hard to make .
- - i guess it should be then notified on wiki as participant in the budget with an asterisk
  - Guess it should  or maybe they re taking money under the table  . o
- - Really cool looking . Is that a dropoff on the sea floor  or something else causing that illusion 
  - From what I understand it is a very deep drop off and the illusion is created from the waves pulling sand down .
- - The day CIS teams slap LoDA s and Singsing s teams around with consistency is a day i never thought i d live to see happen .
  - CIS teams have been shitting on Alliance in scrims for months now .
- - Ugh ... I hate training new people . It s literally the worst part of my job .
  - I can relate to this so much ... Training people while trying to close the store is not fun ...
- - That has to be an ... interesting transition
  - haha . I honestly have nt thought about it till you made that comment . I m so removed with so many other regrets .
- - Okay  so RES is nt tracking new votes right now . This is a known issue . Thanks for clarifying 
  - Any idea when a fix will be released 
- - LOL this guy just bought my wand complaining about a dick bag on torment .
  - hope u had a better time with him
- - The League of Gentlemen  without a shadow of a doubt the funniest TV show we ve ever produced
  - I do nt think there s any way I ll miss that one . I keep hearing about it in glowing terms .
- - I d like to see Wiggins really start to take over this award and just blow everyone else out . He s so much better than everyone else on that list .
  - At this point  if he continues to play like this  it s definitely going to happen
- - Came looking for a picture of a Fox amiibo  was not disappointed .
  - So much fun to be had if you take a moment to enjoy the defects ...
- - I have nightmares of his power going off while working on his antiquated software and losing everything . Could you imagine if he had to start the book over from scratch 
  - For all we know  that could have already happened ...
- - Use your vertical thrusters in the turning battles to make tighter turns and end up behind your opponents
  - thanks for the advise Ill give it a try
- - My bad . The text size adjustment option is reachable by two mouse clicks
  - I see  I ll give it a shot  thanks

- - Because it s stupid that s why not .
  - I think u r the stoopid cus u dont get it  all the hackers with best unreal scores and the crew is not doing anything to delete or ban .
- - Dr. Boom is generally seen as the top choice  other than him it would depend on your class .
  - i play all classes . I already have Dr Boom .
- - Ford only offers these things to people who are vehicles  though which is nt all that deserving of ALOT to me but what do I know 
  - At first I thought Ford were vehicles  but actually you re right .
- - In fairness it was a Venetian mortar shell that actually ignited the magazine
  - Would nt have ignited anything if the Turks had nt decided to use the Parthenon as an artillery magazine .
  - Would nt have blown up the parthenon if the mortar shell had nt hit it . Storing gunpowder in something and launching explosives at something are different .
  - I believe it was also used to fire down on Greeks .
- - Dude  that Central Command coin is sick .
  - I see you are an MA . Have you been Mo SD 
- - And I completely missed all of that  like always . Awesome contest  you re a really cool dude . D happy new year 
  - Just commenting so you get better attention and a higher chance
- - I do nt ... I do nt want to click .

- - yeah ive been having the same issue since last night .
  - I finally got a guildy to port me to Dal ... That worked but I never could get the zep to do right .
- - That sounds great but I want to keep it special attack only so that way I can put everything into that and make its attacks hit super hard .
  - Sounds good man  it is your team after all 
- - Simply refuse to live in states with the laws on the books  Pennsylvania included . Have no business dealings with them . They ca nt sue without jurisdiction .
  - Actually I remember a post where the parents in question lived in Pennsylvania and the kids did not  but the nursing home for the parents was able to successfully sue .
- - Massive contribution to discussion pal . Why do nt you try and explain why you disagree  instead of being a petulant child about it 
  - To be honest  I was kind of having a crappy day
- - My father raised me to NEVER be a gentleman .
  - That s because nice guys finish last . Your sympathy will get you left behind .
- - You got nothing else so you have to resort to petty insults  Yeah we re done here sport .
  - Your argument made no sense . You are a moron .
- - Post removed ; could you be so kind to read the rules before posting  Thanks 
  - Will do  thanks . Sorry for the mistake
- - People are still equating anti-Israel to anti-semitism  It s absolutely not the same thing .
  - I swear man if hamas disappear tomorrow  they will find another reason to keep killing and grabbing land day after day while calling you anti-semite at the same time
- - it s like Australia is AFC but New Zealand is OFC . I m guessing where you are located geographically has nothing to do with this .
  - It was Australia that asked to be in the AFC . Not only does it give them better competition to improve but a far better chance to participate in the WC .
- - Yes . Start a Cleanthony Early fan club first .
  - Is it not too EARLY for that either  Ha . Ha . Ha ... can it be the offseason already 
- - Not a good call IMO . Lions lucky to get the call .
  - He never turned and located the ball  that s an easy call .
- - What socket and chipset are you looking for
  - I think OP might be over his head .
- - Congrats . You officially do nt work with those idiots anymore ... now you work with different idiots .
  - Valid point . At least I still have optimism towards the new idiots .
- - After seeing how bad Arizona s punter was last night  I have a new found respect for good punts
  - If you want to respect punts  go watch Bama s punts from the playoff game .
- - Is this that big of a deal 
  - Its in the CBA . When teams dont follow the CBA  its a big deal .
  - So the Philly players could have just flew commercial and got a reimbursement 
  - Reimbursement would make it not player funded .
- - What s up with your keyboard  Lol
  - Looks like a Kinesis ergo keyboard . The keys are concave in layout to compensate for your different finger lengths .
- - The Challenge Rating and associated XP is included on the stat block for every NPC in the section below their attributes .
  - Ah  I had nt even noticed the generic NPC s in the monster manual . Thanks for your help .
- - The title is incorrect  they also got Klinkhammer from the Pens
  - Which really only furthers my point  does nt it 
- - Looks like you put a lot of thought into this and that almost made me want to read the whole thing .
  - It s not worth it . Imagine this as a conspiracy theorist spewing his crazy thoughts .
- - You ca nt get better if you never challenge yourself .
  - I do nt mind the challenge if we could even do Conquest premade .
- - Please to meet you and I have the meat to please you . As long as I have a face  you ll have a place to sit .

- - I have an egg that matches your TSV . I d be grateful if you could hatch it for me 
  - Hey  Are you still around  I will add you
- - What about other races like Chinese  Japanese  Filipino and etc 
  - I love the Thai  but I m afraid I have nt spent much time with the other races . However I find Asian culture fascinating .
- - Do nt kid yourself  the raid is already a cakewalk .
  - Of course it is  but so was Atheon at this point in his lifespan as a Raid aka grenade cheese .
- - I do nt really know . But  does it really matter  Your profile will carry over and that s all that matters .
  - To the people with limited bandwidth  yea .
- - Still working on the signal path though ... I do nt know if I want the metal zone before or after the Altoids tin ...
  - I never got the altoids box  does it hold picks  Or do you have a circuit board in there
- - I do nt read comics  I ve just seen other peeps use scans  but if IIRC it was by someone looking like hawkman .
  - He was knocked back  not knocked out . Also it should be taken into account that it was magic
- - He does nt give reasons . My copy is nt paid for  and it s because I got it free on Amazon .
  - follow up tweet says this does not include Amazon Appstore
- - I prefer DC movies over Marvel though ...
  - I prefer DC animated films to DC movies .
  - Flashpoint paradox is better than most live action DC movies .
  - Exactly . I even like Justice League Doom more than the live action films . In fact I think I will watch these films later today .
  - Young Justice is better than any DC live action content . I would trade BvS for a third season .
  - Ah man I wanted to know how well Aqua Lad s psyche recovered after that whole debacle . He looked like he would have some serious PTSD .
- - I agree that if you can access the wifi settings  you should connect and see if the owner is trying to find it .
  - I ca nt access anything  but even if I could I would nt want to . Fees weird to poke around someone else s iPod .
- - It looks like it dusted immediately . Probably a vampire
  - Or the ghost of Aunt Jemima s clitoris . Edit . thank you for the gold  Glad someone had a laugh .
- - The people rising up and murdering the corrupt aristocracy .
  - Yes . Revolution . The violent bloody kind .
- - Satire of religion  a belief currently being used to limit the rights of others is absolutely nothing at all akin to making fun of people with disabilities .
  - I think you re missing the point . OP is demonstrating that it is nt cool to be a douchebag to a large swath of people .
- - You performing sexual favors for this or nah 
  - if you blow me away  I ll blow you today .
- - Thanks a lot  edit . I learned a lot  I hope to start writing some rails experiments soon . This got me kickstarted 
  - Awesome  I m glad you were able to find some use out of it .
- - and if they try anything funny  he ll crosscheck them into the next solar system .
  - I would love a David Backes comic where he cross checks aliens . Call it Captain America 
- - Probably better suited for our weekly Marketing Monday threads .
  - Oh sorry man  we just went free and I m looking to get ideas for websites . If I wait until Monday the promotion will be over .
- - This game is so beautiful . Just started eso and explored the red mountain yesterday . Sweet fucking awesome
  - Yea cant wait for the next zone im about to go into
- - That is sincerely beautiful . I d never heard this before . Thank you .
  - same here  Bravo my friend . Thanks for the post .
- - Or the new model may push prices down . Seems like a risk to assume you d get your money back selling an old version .
  - I doubt it . This is like the difference between a DS and a DSi . The DSi did nt immediately push prices of the DS Lite down .
- - Did you also know that actors are really not the character they play and are just acting ...  mind blown
  - We are discussing a character based on a real person . The role is host to a particular gravitas in British culture  so in this instance it matters .
- - A Naga that loses      OMFG we ca nt have that 
  - IG just lost with Naga twice in a row the other day  incidentally .
- - Sanctions that dont work are unilateral . When they are combined with most of the world  or at least most of the countries that matter  it can be very serious
  - I totally agree . Sadly however  it s always those ordinary citizens who usually suffer .
- - They all were . They were just lying .
  - Not likely . Single people tend to avoid new years parties for good reason .
- - While we re on the subject of preventing the promotion of unhealthy body images  the logical extension of this rule should include an upper limit on BMI as well
  - Ha ha ha ha ha ... you think logic has a place here . Thats cute .
- - And to think Bucky s spot was being questioned after the first test
  - People were vicious about it  too . So funny to me that those people are the same ones cheering him on .
- - Would love to  I got Spm this year and my English and bm is nt good .
  - Drop me an email and maybe we could arrange something . Do nt worry too much  SPM is nt intimidating .
- - Are you gon na open your world  Mine says there are no worlds .
  - I added all my Ally mode is on
- - I literally finished playing Fallout . NV two minutes ago  this is not what I need 
  - Just find a Vault  you ll be fine 
- - Steel legion lux s E is very hard to see . I believe it is banned from lcs for this reason .
  - That s the thing  it s hard to see not invisible . Besides the Lux in my game was using Lux s classic .
- - Why is there an ignore reports button on the option list for this post 
  - Hit it  because someone reported this post .
- - Why are nt we in on this  It seems like he d fix a lot of our problems and we certainly have the prospects .
  - i d say he fits our team better than any other team in the league
- - That is only one sample from one point in time . Not enough to come a definitive conclusion .
  - Yeah  I just thought it was mildly interesting at this time .
- - That last lateral play made them the worst team to play in a playoff game  I do nt know if it was worth it
  - It was just poetic in its own way .
- - That sounds terrifying . But I guess that s the point .
  - Oh and it was  But I took comfort knowing I was nt the only one scared .
- - So what are the details  How do you get the free pump 
  - You see the back fit details . The back says see front for details .
- - I just realized that it s weird that the Lost has limbs on his will .
  - It is actually signed as the lost  on the bottom .
- - is that from closing the door or from driving and it slid back 
  - Glass on the ground points to closing the door .
- - Had no idea Will Smith was a part owner .
  - Yup . Him and Jada . He owns like fractions of a percent like Jay Z did with the Nets but still .
- - I saw him face Brian Cage at PWG Untitled II  and shit fucking blew my mind .
  - It also blew Cage s mind . I ll get my coat ...
- - Is the case only up for local pick up 
  - Yea  I used the original box to ship out a different case LOL . I thought I would stick with this case and ATX but the mATX bug bit me .
- - Come on man  why did you have to use those cheesy Instagram filters 
  - Haha  Pic was taken before anyone heard of a digital camera .
- - Well  I liked the Offspring one 
  - The offspring is great for dancing around to and letting loose
- - Any chance we ll be seeing more performance optimization as well  A lot of people currently have a lot of problems getting anywhere near dungeons  or the outpost
  - I believe it has been said that the unstable builds are not optimized for performance . So perhaps waiting for the stable build if you are having issues there .
- - I really hope this was nt purchased just to make this joke .
  - No I bought it to walk my grey dog around the neighborhood . I m not crazy 
- - Was the d man alright  That looked pretty bad .
  - He was fine  goaltender was the only one who left the game .

  - Thanks  I would never go back if I could . She knows I always eyed it at the store .
- - Tried but he has said no  or tried but could nt get close enough to ask 
  - Given how it sounds like Horner had no reservations signing this  I think it might be the latter . Still awesome to see it done  however .
- - Jonny Evans looked woefully out of his depth today  he s a shadow of the player who filled in for Vidic a couple of years back and thrived .
  - It s because we lack a true  senior centre back . None of these lads know how to run a defence like Rio and Vidic did .
- - You pretty much have to already be dead to be literally devoured by fungi in the woods .
  - This is true . Just trying to paint the woods in its full glory .
- - Remember . Everyone finishes their drinks if Leggo loses his lunch again .
  - oh god  same ref as last night 
- - Coincidence . Yeah people are lame  but making funny faces is the best 
  - You will be swimming in that shirt . In other news  your girlfriend is pretty . Well done OP .
- - Killzone Mercenary is the best fps . Bought CoD Declassified thinking that would be cool  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND  Sly Cooper is cool if you like platformers .
  - I enjoy platformers  but somehow never touched a sly cooper . Also I noticed Killzone Mercenary I believe it was at the top of most downloaded games for vita .
- - Plot twist . OP s cum was the ingredient
  - Do nt knock til you ve tried it . He might eat a lot of pineapples . You do nt know .
- - She did nt want to be mean and tell you no but she s not interested .
  - This is quite plausible . Take it like a champ and move on with your life .
- - They will only grant them while they are at peace . If they are at war now they will grant them immediately after ending all their wars .
  - They ve been at peace for quite some time .
- - Knock on her door in a few hours appologize again  and claim you were sleepwalking or having some kind of diabetic episode  or weird reaction to a medication .
  - Just leave a note like a non-confrontational stoner would . But first put it off for a few days .
- - Hey  that s my car . Except I m assuming this did nt get into two accidents .
  - it s in near excellent condition except for the missing fog lamps due to road construction .
- - I m sure there s someone on this sub that might  but it always is kinda dead here .
  - That is true . Plus most would be at SB .
- - It s very well done  I am a bit confused  though  because I do nt see this piece on the DA you linked to  OP .
  - He just posted the finished version on Instagram this morning . I guess he has nt updated his DA gallery yet .
- - Do you have any advice for a young entrepreneur 
  - In summary  you just have to really feel passionate about and believe in the cream everytime you rub it onto someone s herpes .
- - wow  great map  would love to have some lore of it .
  - To bad there is none . Feel free to throw out some names and such and I ll add em to the sketch .
- - Going with Iron Man for both rounds . Arguably similar strength and durability  while Iron Man has vastly superior combat speed and speed .
  - What kinds of feats does Iron Man have these days  I haven ; t even looked at any of the new stuff  just curious
- - Mystery solved  He obviously showed them the body in front of their house  NOT in the Best Buy parking lot .
  - That s something a Serial Killer would do .
- - TIL . Canadian rock band groups are bros
  - Totally . Canadians are awesome . But I m biased . p
- - I see that you will be at Strand tonight . Entice me 
  - You can come heckle me in person  ask me anything  and get a book . Triple win .
- - You sure rust is anywhere close to high tier  People pay less for rust on knives already .
  - Nah I did nt really mean that  I m sure Volvo added rust to throw a lower tier at the poorer traders .
- - My weapon is a Water Axe . a fuckin water axe . called ... Pure Strength . dammit life .
  - Torpedo hair straightener named Golden Embers . I do nt know if that s awesome or pathetic .
- - DETROIT VS ERRBODY  CANT STOP WONT STOP
  - They run things  things do nt run tha D
- - Oh . Raccoon . I was about to question you .
  - You never know ... I was right there with ya .
- - The FCC s version of Net Neutrality includes the stupid Fast Lanes . They ve literally changed the definition to suit their own agenda ...
  - So you ve read the draft proposal that has nt been written yet 
- - Hope so  I just want to be able to walk around without fear of toppling over .
  - Please stop . My workmates are starting to ask why I m laughing so hard .

- - Rubber Its about a homicidal tire with telekinetic powers ... need i say more 
  - First glance  I thought you said Flubber . Glad you gave a description .
- - the real question is if the mastery point to reduce summoner spells cool down will lower the charge timer or the time between smites .
  - This was really the main thing I was wondering . It would def rearrange some masteries .
- - It s not direct damage  and it s not even your own DPS
  - I never said it was your own damage . You still deal amazing damage with it .
- - Got ta eat at the arena tonight . Anyone got a recommendation 
  - BBQ Nachos  the Chinese food is good  Chicken and waffles ...
- - I have to say cornelius feels more like a ferret name  but it is great as a bat name as well .
  - Hehe yeah  I can agree with that  but it s a sweet bat name too .
- - People still do nt get that bullets are affected by gravity .
  - That s why I always shot the ground to celebrate or just buy some fire crackers
- - Is it unusual that I clench my buttcheeks every time Bama does a handoff 
  - It d be weird if you did nt .
- - Fuck you all who said we do nt belong here
  - But did you see TCU play  You two should play
- - Hayden really made me believe he hated sand .
  - It s rough and coarse ... And it gets everywhere .
- - This just in . Suicide bombers are brave  context is not necessary . What the fuck is happening .
  - What s happening is you re cherry picking quotes to support your view .
- - I had a guy surf for hotels on his phone where he thought i couldnt see . THEN he falls asleep during the movie .

  - I m trying to find someone to go with me to the Chicago date  I m pretty hyped 
- - Please stop spamming the sub with these . Thanks .
  - I agree with you and do nt understand why you were down voted . If I m worried about speed traps  I ll use Waze .
- - By remembering the conflict it has caused between you .
  - I also decided that I will be going on a SOLO plan . Thank you all for the advice 
- - You look like a guy from MadTV I ca nt remember him  but if you look it up you ll know 
  - Hmm I tried looking it up but i couldnt find anything . Is it a good thing I look like this person

  - I think Locke and Rick would be interesting
- - Just the preaching . Nobody s gon na hate on you for having one here .
  - It s certainly a better group of people over here .
- - Just curious because I was thinking of maybe building a cabin one day ... how do you treat logs that you cut down from your own forest

- - You know they have allies  right  China would be obligated to go to war with them .
  - I dunno . I kinda wonder if N. Korea is just a running joke to China .
- - This shows VAC can ban innocent players .
  - Indeed it does  I would nt dispute that .
- - Exactly . If something funny happens  it would probably be a ref or crew and not the league .
  - Exactly . The whole idea of the NFL rigging games seems appetizing especially after the game yesterday  but it s kind of a long shot .
- - let people copy fits and then incorporate what they liked with that fit into their own style  there s nothing wrong with copying inherently
  - There is within the context of art ...
- - Here s hoping . It d be more interesting than ever before .
  - Maybe it ll be that one team .

- - Will she die if she does nt take them 
  - she may prefer to die if she does nt take them .
- - Can not find a purchase option anywhere .

- - I m a United fan  came here to say  MP has got your players fit and full of desire  what a performance  phenomenal .
  - Glad to hear that from the outside . I think we re all a little confused about these last few years .
- - Duh you pretend to have free speech . Then prosecute the hell out of everybody who disagrees with you . This is the situation in the UK right here right now .
  - Well it has nt been implemented quite like that yet besides in a few cases but it is worrying nevertheless the potential the act has to be a tool for corruption .
- - Dat ass  good lord I ve never seen an ass shaped like that .
  - Oh cmon shitlord  She s just extra curvy 
- - Thank you . Most people do nt appreciate the difference in my experience . Marketing Companies certainly do nt help .
  - I googled Metroidvania because I immediately think of Metroid and Castlevania for SNES and this comparison confuses me even more .

  - I always think it would be awesome to see Brady with the Denver WR corps just to see what he could do .
- - Nice to see some accountability from a vendor . Shit happens  and some people would just run away . Hope everything gets smoothed out 
  - Smoothed out . I see what you did there .

- - how does one find a lookout  waterfall or rock formation
  - Trail guides from the library  Google .
- - I never noticed The Hobbit has no women . Damn .
  - So  honest question that anyone can answer . Does this mean you re conditioned to sexism  or does it mean it just did nt matter 
- - That s what I thought too  And now that I ve heard good things about NARS  I may just try it next ...
  - There are some very lovely and unique colors 
- - Yeah it got really silly really quick . Evidently this sub does nt have a lot of Eminem fans .
  - I like his music but rape is not something to joke about ever

- - Your mistake was trusting stool instead of chair .
  - I ll make sure my children remember this lesson .
- - Why is that top button just slightly off center 
  - Design and manufacturing . Same reason Apple moved the button to the side .

- - Vikings qb developing just fine under their defensive minded head coach  that s what an offensive coordinator and qb coach are for
  - True but we have nt figured out who s going to be ours .

  - And all within a minute so they make they instantaneous launch window .
- - Born  live  die . Um . I guess that s accurate in a simplistic kind of way . Kind of a dumb cartoon IMHO .

  - I do this to my friend now but hes a dick about it .
- - Ya  you re right . The shot total clearly indicates that we are dominating and they are garbage .
  - Please highlight where I used the word dominating . I said we were outplaying them the entire game  which we were .
