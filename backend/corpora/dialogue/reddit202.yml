  - I thought the same thing ... I think he just runs awkwardly
- - Except the government is nt stopping the NSA . That s the problem .
  - Is nt that cuz the NSA is government 
- - They should definitely hire a sound technician this year .
  - I thought the sound was really good ...
  - The sound engineering was great  but the music was often so goddamn loud . It should complement a scene  not dominate it .
  - I thought that was more of a problem in the later RTD era . And even still it was nt too bad .
- - How much is it to ship to NYC  I ll pay for it . Let me know how much .
  - I do nt know . If you are OK with regular mail  it should nt cost much .

- - Glad to see that Support players are the ones that most likely will never leave . As a Support main it makes me proud .
  - Supports and tanks in general are true bros .

- - Fuck everything about that . There s no way anyone does that .
  - this is a bad thread for extremely OCD people .
- - Maybe Brendan could have managed him better like Lampard at City .
  - Lampard comes off the bench for City . That is precisely what Gerrard does nt want to do and why he decided to leave .
- - Not the original keyboard    You ve angered the Chiclet God  Heretic 
  - I think I wore out the original one since you can see that my wrists have worn away the paint .
- - Check the mods . They re the most trust worthy here

- - The American Dream ... well maybe just dreams in general . P
  - It s a dream because you d have to be asleep to believe it .
- - Game of War actually has TV commercials featuring Kate Upton  so they re getting money from somewhere
  - Is that the boobies on a charging horse commercial 
- - I ca nt even imagine that situation unfolding in front of me . It just seems too ridiculous to be true . How did anyone keep a straight face 
  - I see people posing all the time  what s the big deal 
- - Part of me wants to lose this game just so Dalton does nt get that pay raise .
  - Oh I m sure he d still get it .

- - Wow film stuff is cheap . When I get my next house I m making a darkroom to develop b and w .

  - Those small rings are probably worse than these 
- - We used to line rooms with newspapers while the dog is sick if putting her somewhere more comfortable is nt an option . Stuff absorbs pretty well

  - same thing happened to me now i have to wait forever for the game to install
- - He looks like he s having soooooo much fun .
  - It s deceptive . I know it seems like a waste of time to track a non-moving object but he can go quick when he wants to .
- - God dammit  I hate receiving the ball first half  Why have nt we deferred at all this year  
  - I like the idea of setting the tone of the game
- - How many unsportsmanlike penalties make an ejection 
  - Two . That s why the NCAA has put an emphasis on white hats pointing out a player s first UNS .
- - Saying we are better than those teams you listed really is nt saying a whole lot
  - But I m saying the Bears are better than those other teams  meaning based on talent  they have the best chance of going worst to first .

- - holy shit dude your a fucking badass . definitely mirin and definitely an inspiration to me

- - That regulation applies to civil aircraft  not models . It even specifies objects that would not cause injury are allowed .
  - True but the FAA is regulating the model aircraft world  so I was just playing by their rules .
- - It would be like IRL . No one really has any claim over their land . Its just for some reasons
  - So ... we re not changing the treaty 
- - Why are we passing so well with most of our guys out 
  - No one plays hero ball . They re playing real basketball now .
- - Right here . Looking forward to them doing more PC lets plays  especially modded minecraft
  - Same . There is probably some people out their who have made Achievement City replicas on PC already too .
- - they why didnt they wait with buffing him before fixing him  ...

  - thanks dude  Sadly im not the first one to think of it thought xD wouldve been cool
- - I second this  I am curious  but at work .
  - Racist sub that likens black people to monkeys .

- - What does the tool library have to do with activism  exactly 
  - Building community  right to access  making things affordable .
- - A great anchor and a true pioneer . I know I m not the only one who grew up watching Stu on sportscenter . He will truly be missed .
  - its crazy how just his sports announcing was so significant in a lot of our lives growing up
- - Using a crowbar kind of requires some sort of damage to the structure . The structure is the LL s property .
  - And that s why there are security deposits .
- - But he s so close to dunking  why would he risk doing that  I do nt think it was deliberate .
  - It s a good question . It seems ridiculously risky for little reward .
- - el teamspeak de hoy se va a poner bueno .
  - Ah cabron porque  paso algo relevante 
- - I ve done that before  but It s more like gambling than scalping is nt it 
  - Definitely but in the end  you re trying to turn profit on cards off of other people  so it is a form of scalping .
- - I swear we ll never get to see Bama v Oregon .
  - That s what i m most bummed about . Good season
- - how does isis treat people who are mentally ill and steal or do not fully understand what they are doing

- - I m too young for that to have come into effect .
  - Do you think you would really go through with it 
- - Agreed . He s not Cena or Ryback  it could well be natural
  - What  Are you saying Ryback is on the juice  NO WAY 
- - Of course I am interested  but I m not going to learn another language to decipher it .
  - And quite understandably so  which is why I offered to answer all your questions regarding it  insofar as I am able .
- - Every coach gets fired from Jacksonville  though . Otherwise they d have to look at the organization itself for a reason why they are so terrible .
  - I know . Just giving the guy reasoning as to why he went from the NFL to CFB . Because of course no one willingly does that .
- - Sweet Complexity is superb . Best Bananas Foster flavor I have yet tasted
  - Seriously tasty . Did not think it would be anywhere near as good as people said . I was totally wrong .

  - Putting us back in the AFC West  How would AFC and NFC west look in your scenario 
- - You can easily fly through black holes and end up somewhere else if the hole is connected to a white hole .
  - Can you elaborate  Does spaghettification and all the terrible things that happen when you enter a singularity just stop because a white hole is connected 
- - Can someone explain why this is not Backcourt violation  New to NBA
  - Ball was tipped . Ref made the tip signal .
- - My four year old nephew keeps asking my bf why he s brown
  - When I was little I thought black people had just spent a lot of time in the sun . I guess in an evolutionary sense that s correct though .
- - Why would a sporting clays edition have a Nordic tube on it 
  - It s his competition gun  I think
- - i imagine ubi will see this and sell one . if they can assassin creed shaving gel  they can far cry a watch
  - Assassins creed shaving gel ...  Please for the love of anything holy tell me your bullshitting
- - During the brawl in the beginning there was that older kinda fat security guard with long hair trying to break up wrestlers . Anyone know who this is he looked very familiar
  - I noticed him too . Maybe an ecw guy 
- - Well if you do nt know what happens when half a trillion in junk bonds invested in a now unprofitable business default I guess you are about to find out .
  - Mmm ... Aggressive expansion because of fracking . This will be some fun fallout .
- - Nooooo  Log hair girls for life .
  - Seriously  who would do such a thing . I also did a quick search for girls with log hair  but it only showed akatsuki
- - Yes  but those meds are actually to reduce mania symptoms  so it s definitely weird
  - Sadly  they do nt always work and usually do nt prevent all symptoms . I m glad ops roommate is going home  presumably for help and support .
- - Upload your picture to imgur and then download it again . Should reduce the size .
  - Yep . Bad way . But easy  they have good compression methods . Doesnt reduce quality .
  - why would this be a bad way 
  - They are better ways to do compression that you have more control . And probably faster .
- - I assumed the licenses already had a fleg and they removed it  rather than it being a new thing . So a non-issue became an even bigger non-issue .
  - They ve got the EU one on it .
- - You should do a documentary on failed Kickstarters and use Kickstarter to fund it .
  - Dibs on the documentary of the documentary .
- - I remember creating my own card game because i was too poor to buy pokemon cards like my friends . Creativity is a beautiful thing
  - Yeah  I actually made a few Yu-Gi-Oh cards back when I was into that .
- - No sexytimes  I believe ; I have all the DLC but I m following the FAQ s advice on when to play them so have nt got there yet .
  - Yes you can  right at the end of the dlc if i remeber correctly . I think it depends on what you have done with the other potential LI though .
- - You sound bitter like you must be one of those asshole customers .
  - I m gon na need you to send that comment back to the kitchen  it is nt done right .
- - You are very slow  my friend .
  - thanks for zero help  why even post
  - I could ask you the same thing  what do you expect anyone to say or do for you  Good luck
  - not be a douche is a nice start  i asked a simple question
- - No I ll do it . I got nothing else today anyways .
  - All right ... I do nt know your name . I m Peter .
  - Yes we people in the first are amazing soliders
  - Hmm . Maybe it s just natural then .
- - You re right - my examples were nt good ones .
  - well in some very old cultures without organized observation the gods  probably was an easier explanation than some complicated solar system .
- - It s my birthday too love to share it with this magnificent man
  - Happy birthday  It s mine as well  and I do nt know how I did nt know I shared a birthday with Tolkien .
- - Yeovil will eventually tire and we will capitalise . They re just super fired up at the start but will tail off .

- - So are you implying all Latinos are criminals  Why would the police shoot them  I know a lot of Spanish people that would disagree with your dumb opinion .
  - Since when are Latinos Spanish  I hear this said all over the place . You would nt call someone from west Africa French .
- - I really do nt look at other men in that way anymore . It s as though they ve all turned into dolphins .
  - That is the best way to describe exactly how I feel too 
- - I like how you call someone who reinstall the game an asshole .
  - He probably deletes his Steam account and burns his CD keys whenever he gets a new computer .
- - Have they tried shaking it  That usually works for polaroids
  - That s not a TV  it s an Etch-a-Sketch .
- - I m enamored by that egg . The edges look ever so slightly overdone but man that yolk looks incredible .
  - Thank you  I do nt know if it s a common method  but medium heat and lid on always yields the best eggs .
- - Diseases are a technology if you know how . Which we do .
  - Unless you ve posted to say you ve research a way to develop diseases from nothing  no you do nt .
- - Go-karting . Is there a track in your city 
  - I must find out  I know their is one somewhat nearby .

  - True  im still hoping for him but it doesnt sound like it will happen this weel .
- - FAKE AS HELL . NASA does nt allow any drugs onboard any spacecraft  and the astronauts are subject to monthly drug testing .
  - And they also make them put cotton swabs in their dickholes  lighten up .
- - Is this a tv show kind like of the office or is that an actual principle 
  - its tru tv  its probably a comedy skit show

  - I m consolidating to move  and this shooter did nt make the cut .
- - Jordan was the former  and also a terrible coach . That s the only data point I have  though  so he may just be the exception .
  - Pretty sure the GOAT is always an exception .
