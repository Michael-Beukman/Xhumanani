  - oh I love Jason Mraz . He s super cheesy at times but other than that he s like the coolest dude ever .
- - Is it bad I have nt been thinking about Big Al that much 
  - Unfortunately he just has nt been quite the player he was last season . More like the black hole all the Jazz fans said he was .
- - to be fair  in monsters it was more because it was super low budget and the director had to do all the effects himself .
  - Yeah  that makes sense . But I still believe he might have used that tactic in Godzilla in a good way .

  - If you re implying that s the first time someone s told me I m not funny  you re right . Good call  chief .
- - i do nt think there are any gay ones
  - sure there are  discrete or closeted maybe due to the conservative atmosphere
- - After investigating further  I agree . Mobile can be deceiving .
  - You guys are tripping  Just look at her personal Facebook pics  she is a nice looking woman

  - the facts are in  your hypothetical does nt hold up to them . the woman lived .
  - Yes  one anecdotal incident is all your need to draw a conclusion .

  - I do nt disagree . I m not sure what you mean .
- - I need one they are so cute .
  - They are not domestic cats  but rather a completely different  wild species . I do nt think owning one would be very responsible .

  - Thanks man  sorry I just woke up hahaha
- - wow not even np . ur gon na get banned
  - Breh I tried to NP  but the Url is so brawly that it did nt work
- - No . I m better than a culture that does nt allow women to drive or go out without a male family member .
  - No  I think you missed the point .
  - No  the point is wrong . Cultures all have issues  but they are far from all being equal .
  - I did nt say all cultures are equal . I said you missed the point . Which you clearly did .

- - do the mods turn off the flares to reduce bandwidth or something 
  - Maybe . Although  the steelers flairs have nt faded yet .

- - At the end  I wished Smaug did nt die and killed everyone  because he s the only interesting character in the series  the voice actor is really good .
  - Agreed . Dunno why they bothered to include the first scene with Smaug to be honest . Should have left it in the second .

  - Where did they say that  Its not okay anywhere . Question . does trolling get your dick hard or something

  - Lol what are you talking about  Nothing is permanent 
- - And that s what he was  another dead junkie .
  - I think we can all agree that these characters are not worth sympathy without deciding that their life was meaningless to everyone they knew .
