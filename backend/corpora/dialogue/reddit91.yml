- - Wait . So is OP addressing new players or young players 
  - He is addressing new players  I believe . It s a stupid word .
- - I do nt understand the benefit of this . The cars are just going to catch up with you anyway .
  - But now it s much more obviously their responsibility to give the cyclist room . Also  passing you down the road is much safer than passing you through an intersection .

  - I ll ask her and look at our list when I get home later . You are amazing  Thank you for your help 
- - A key that unlocks many different locks is a master key . A lock that is opened by several different keys is a shitty lock .

  - It s done in the round and then Kitchener d together  which gives it that look .

- - Glad to know that families are acceptable collateral damage to you .
  - I m trying to be sympathetic to people who tweet abusive  hateful GG garbage all day and have their employer listed in their bio . But it s difficult .
  - Not seeing this particular guy being hateful or abusive  just argumentative .
  - Disagreeing is harassment have nt you heard . I seriously do nt know how some of this people can actually interact with the outside world .
- - Hahahahaha stay angry bruh . I m seriously here for you if you need to talk about the root of your irrational anger  though .
  - Which anger is this  Is it similar to the anger you feel at your supposed oppression

- - Any idea what would work on black plastics in general  ie . black to white
  - Wont work  has to be light to dark .
- - Just posted two lesbian one s and one where I tried to describe the mindset more ...
  - Nice . New caps are so rare here
- - The problem is that sometimes bowlers bowl from behind the crease which would not produce a buzz .
  - I meant the whole crease area . If he bowls from behind the stumps I do nt think there is an issue there
