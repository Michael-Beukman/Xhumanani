- - What about damage to the car  Or is that something you ca nt tell from a description
  - Well it s certainly not going to go away on its own . You probably wo nt damage anything other than the tranny though .
- - Fascinating  What led to your dog being diagnosed  What does he do that you recognize as different 
  - I m not OP just posting some info on autistic dogs .
- - Wow . Sorry for the long wait . Facer is not working with me . I m going to try watchmaker to see if I can make it look better .
  - Hey no problem  I actually had someone else make one for me already though . Thanks anyways though man 
- - Toledo and Ark St. just what everybody wants to see
  - Toledo was more entertaining to watch this season than Michigan was .
- - Do you have a replay and did you see the damage display either in-game or showing in the post game damage report 
  - I have a replay . It shows one damage value in game and in the hit log . I do nt have the after match report anymore ...
- - if you were standing at the peak of olympus mons  you would not be able to see the base of the mountain from where you were standing .
  - Also  if you were standing at the base you would not be able to see the peak because it s below the horizon
- - Maybe your cousin is just a lazy piece of shit .
  - He was featured in an episode so doubtful . I can show you which one if you care enough .

- - Think you got the wrong thread buddy .

  - A fun  drug addled  new year s day commentary of course 
- - I feel like Greg Olsen deserved at least one vote ; . ;
  - Was he better than Gronk  If not  he does nt deserve a vote .

  - She ended up with the knife handle deep in her gut  idk if lucky is the word I would use .
  - As shitty as it is  a knife wound is still a hell of a lot better than getting killed .
  - Not for her if her goal was to kill herself .
  - What makes you so sure she was trying to kill herself 
  - If you watch the whole video the cop at the beginning says they were called there about a woman who was threatening to commit suicide .

- - In the leftist mind  opposing welfare is exactly the same as breaking into single mothers home and killing their babies .
  - Very well said . And avoiding taxes -- even legally -- is considered theft
  - Which is funny since if there s no private property how can that be theft .
  - Those are viewpoints from entirely different groups of people  and a lack of private property by no means entails theft being impossible .
- - On the inside  I have Rain-X on all exterior windows already .
  - It works on the inside as well . You can also use it to keep the bathroom mirror from fogging up when you take a shower .

  - It was supposed to be the CSGL destroyer .
- - Honestly though  I d be happy if they just continually churned out Uncharted sequels until the end of time - they are everything I want in a game .

- - Please take your shit posts to an actual sledgehammer forum and get the fuck out because it is annoying as shit seeing all you post this shit .
  - The game has major issues  theres not much else to talk about ...
- - Swatted a fly once and maggots fell out everywhere . Good luck catching em . Ill stick to tools
  - With the hand  you do nt splatter them . You just catch it and kinda kill it with just enough force .
- - I do nt think the doctor would let the second person into the exam room . It s kind of a privacy thing .
  - My sis comes in with me all the time . It boils down to if you give permission for that person to be there .
- - Where did she slap you  Face  Hands 
  - It was my hand and definitely not a love tap .  Haha
- - Let s not forget the No to AV  campaign  which should tell you all you need to know about the major parties  love of democracy .

- - It s ok  some people have bad taste in films . You  for example .

- - Natu used Future Sight  SINNOH CONFIRMED  Is it too early to start doing this 
  - People were using the shapes of clouds in the very first ORAS trailer to claim that Sinnoh was confirmed . It s never too early .
- - About the same as convincing anyone to give up their comforting lies  myself included .
  - The only people who will give it a second thought are those who were already doubting in the first place .
- - Man  Korver looks like an underrated defender . He did a great job of doubling on Gasol that possession .
  - I know its like classic white guy analysis   but he does apply good effort and his spacing is typically good .
- - This is the Muslim we need . Not some idiots which shoot down freedom . There should be more like this guy .

  - My first though . Here we go again 
- - I thought we were always drunk ... by default .
  - Definitely a difference between the drunk I am and the shitfaced I will become
- - For those who can stomach it  reading several books at the same time is another suggestion .
  - For those of us getting English degrees  we do nt have a choice .
- - Do you use the side buttons on the naga at all  If so that might limit you somewhat .
  - I do nt use them  they feel really unecessary since i can do pretty much everything on my keyboard
- - I think it s people like you who do nt know the difference between Whose and Who s Who s means Who is  Whose means belonging to someone
  - I know  iphone keyboards are nt exactly good for typing . I just make something that resembles the word and auto correct does the rest
- - Ah  I did nt catch that but that looks really cool  definitely use it
  - No worries  I d forgotten I d posted it before so it surprised me seeing it here

  - And her backup singers sounded way better . And she even had some of her track pre-recorded to lip sync too . Pathetic .

  - Does nt seem to be ISO related ... nothing fixed the problem I ll have to test the cables .
- - Oh the retaliation from them is awful so in some cases Id rather be late but I have left them in the past but I pay for it when I get home
  - Do the I drove around the block to pretend like I was leaving you  because then you can hear the back lash in the car
- - I think this is amazing . I suppose it s useless to analyze it -- just another inexplicable occurrence .
  - Well unless lucid dreaming technology is finally mastered .
- - While it is confusing  if you know what it looks like it could be easier to drive ...
  - Yup  mechanic is genius and intentional .
- - Yeah we should definitely be fine . We are fortunate to essentially have a fortress country ready to stop them though  thanks poles .

  - No I agree  I m having a hard time with this situation .
- - They had Del Toro  James Cameron and fucking Tom Cruise . The bastards blew it up . It should have been a project at Warner Bros .
