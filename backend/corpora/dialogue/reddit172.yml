  - If they do rattle I ca nt hear them because the subs are loud
- - Oda confirmed there s no connection to Kuina and Tashigi . We ve seen Tashigi as a kid and she looks nothing like Kuina .
  - Oh  well there you have it then .
- - Looks like it was taken in a cell phone store . Possibly trying to trade it in 
  - I do believe that she s boarding a plane at Ohare in this picture .
- - You do nt have one for me either  so MEH
  - I DO NT HAVE TO  I M THE OP .

- - You really need to stop spamming your product on here ...
  - I m so glad I m not the only one saying this 
- - Do you think he s going to settle as a SG or PG  Kind of tough to figure out given his size and current skill set .
  - PG who defends SG or plain SG is probably the plan . He should be able to play both once he learns a handle .
- - Friggin awesome . Tell him to do OK Computer or The Bends if he thinks he can .
  - I doubt anyone could pull off OK Computer .
- - I mean if you think that s all outside of a franchise s control then sure  but I do nt buy it .

  - What s the difference between subsidized and unsubsidized 
- - There are also hundreds of alien abduction stories that are strikingly similar spread across centuries . Does that mean that they are true 
  - Seriously  Alien abduction stories  Ok. Let s go down this rabbit hole . How do you know those stories are nt true

  - If there s one thing a business cares about  its staying around to make more money 
- - Love it . I meant the current one  but I m just generally a fan .
  - You re alright in my book  Terp .
- - no good comes from porn  only filth and sadness . Knowing that blocks my urges to fap .
  - Indeed  so to porn I say never again . Sadly life too is often filled with filth and sadness . But together with the nofap community we stay strong 
- - Then you are living in another dimension or something . Every time a friend got mugged or beaten up it was a muslim immigrant .
  - It s most likely a socio economic reason  instead of their religion saying go forth and mug .

  - Bad idea . Do nt . This is a bulking program . It s meant to increase muscle mass specifically .
- - someone has to be home with the cat

  - Flair up so I can make fun of ur favorite player
- - They re not drunk . They re high on Yorkshire Tea . It s like crack .
  - They re darts players . They re pissed .
- - I understand it being a choice . But this sounds like pressure and guilt to me .
  - Well  you should probably look into it before jumping to conclusions like that .
- - Guys  would be nice if you can comment on the Eng translation quality after watching the movie . Thanks .
  - I liked your translation  man . Good work

  - They have one goal each  I say they re finishing fine .
- - Get yourself some Mr Clean magic erasers . They work on everything and do nt use harsh chemicals . It s just melamine foam .

- - Let us know if you find him 
  - I definitely will . Crossing fingers . Thank you .
- - Translation . My greatest weakness is a lack of understanding of basic economics
  - Please  explain how any of this is technically incorrect .
- - Right after that he pushed Smith off of the court
  - hahaha what  I did nt see that . Did nt have it on TV in Va .
- - Me too ... More time at work than need be .
  - It stings a little more when you have your hand literally on the handle to leave
- - Stoning women for adultery is lawful in some countries . Is that murder

- - These are considered a C cup all day long in Australia . DD s lol
  - You do nt know how bra sizes work
- - Looks like the ham is so hungry she might eat her own thumb
  - I hate that pose . It looks so nasty

  - Having used ONA ... it can make your buds taste like you re making out with a bottle of AXE .
- - I want to ascend . Not allowed .
  - My wallet wo nt allow it . So does buying games haha
- - WOW . Turkey is a poor country  how can the people not be up in arms over this 
  - Poor  It s a relative term I suppose . In some ways yes  but I think defining them as a poor country is ignorant .
- - Damn ... You really want to write .
  - Maybe  maybe I have faith in those teams . Either way  it does nt look like anybody is taking me up on it
- - likely depends on style  but I d say you can store longer than a growler  but not as long as a normal can .
  - Why not  If it does nt have oxygen in it  is kept cold  etc it ll keep just as long as a can or bottle or keg .
- - So experience means nothing in your world 
  - The experienced will make very valuable advisors  ultimately though the younger ones should make final decisions .
- - dude seriously  Are you people like stalking this fat cunt  Pick a new target this horse is dead as fuck .
  - Yeah  this place is seriously starting to look like the fatlogic Ragen Chastain circlejerk with all these Tess Munster posts .

- - Why use the hammer in the first place 
  - Yes . Maybe this was nt the best analogy to begin with .
- - You tried so hard and got so far .
  - But in the end  it does nt even matter .
- - It s fine to be offended  but acting like that means you re entitled to something is retarded . Quit being a faggot and grow up .
  - Responding to a comment about being offended does nt mean I m offended  bro .
- - Do nt play Eve Online ... you might die 
  - When he described WT I was reminded of my solo days in eve . Amarr Victor 
- - Yeah because our current President is such a champion of the people and would never serve corporate interests over the masses .
  - You re right  all politicians are dirty to some degree but comparing President Obama to Christie is more than a stretch it s moronic fox news bullshit .
- - I know stuff about super guard people do nt really know about cx it s just too cheap so blehh I no use it . ; - ;
  - I mean what is there to know ... It blocks things ...
- - Fire marshal s concern was not being able to close the panel while energized . The ground is a hack job too .

  - I wear leggings everyday my legs are rarely shaved haha  Hardly any places are tbh 
- - You gave numbers for raw corn and wheat but for cooked rice .

  - What about if someone posts them to you 
- - why will they not give kadri and kessel an extended run together 
  - I think horachek is just experimenting for now  if he s actually looking at the possession numbers then its obvious that line was sick .

  - I do nt see a problem here they look right to me . I ll pick some up and get the evidence

  - the cases on the left and right are the OEM hard cases from OnePlus on their accessories store
- - The games store has it in real time for everyone now- do you want him to post a screenshot or something 
  - Can you post a screenshot  Some of us have no idea what you are talking about .
- - Is that the prices too the far right . Cause holy hell that mark up is insane .
  - I took my girlfriend there for our anniversary a few weeks ago . Boston is expensive in general  but this place even kinda sticks out from the beer bar scene .
- - The twist - I m in a moving vehicle right now . You move quickly  OP .
  - That I do . That I do .
- - I-I m glad I have a penis ...
  - My SO s penis is the reason is the reason I m doing this . I m sure he s thrilled as well .
- - Thank fucking god  but put that fucker back in the caves where it belongs .
  - Or so help me  So help me

  - Okay  let s say we do that . Congrats  unkillable beast . Pre-nerf status regained  Hooray ...

  - Knives in the kitchen  or steel bars in my room .
- - Does this only apply to devices purchased on the play store or does this apply to all carrier devices too 
  - Only Play Store orders . You have to contact your carrier about returns if not . I want to say LG also handles returns  but someone would have to confirm that
- - I just grabbed a trading paints one last minute . I think instead of paint schemes we re going to have to memorize numbers .
  - Good point . I always forget that we actually have set numbers since its not official .
- - I did nt know Boston had it in them .
  - We re massholes  but we re good sports fans .

  - The promo pic shows Falco so I m thinking he s gon na go with him for old times  sake regardless of if he s actually switched mains or not
- - Surely someone could just take the tower down surreptitiously . There would be no way for these boosters to know who had done it .
  - My guess is the server was full of new players who perhaps didnt know that theres no way to tell

  - But she gave her fins up for legs so she could get with the guy .
