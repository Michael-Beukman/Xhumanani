  - Is it recognized as a microphone or something  I ve done this and could nt find anything anywhere . May have just had it disabled is all though
- - I think the fact that any person around you can suddenly snap and hurt you or a loved one is terrifying .

- - i hate his face  yall know who im talking about lol
  - Would you like to partake in the complimentary crab legs 
- - My family drives from place to place . since it costs just about the same . longer yes . but worth it .

- - Graphics designers get fucked at any and every opportunity .
  - That s why I write up contracts as much as possible when dealing with clients .
- - It s going to sound stupid but consistently the best burgers I ve eaten are from Fuddruckers . They re not even gourmet burgers  but they re so freaking good .
  - Preach  They closed the Fuddruckers in my town and I had to settle for Smashburger - not even close .
- - I thought it was used bong water 
  - I m sure at one point it was . Would nt surprise me at all .

  - Hard boiled are the worst texture-wise  but I actually just hate eggs in general .
- - Yeah  I know . Note my edit  which I added moments before seeing your reply .

  - Do you have to put up with something similar 
- - It should make you unhappy because he keeps getting leverage for that next contract
  - We can give him the max for like four years  if anything I m not worried in the least
- - All these people crying about it are uninformed I swear . They just keep banging on about rape rape rape .
  - Funny that  when we re talking about a rapist  and the consequences of the rape ...
  - And as if to prove my point ...
  - My point is you seem surprised to see people talking about rape  in a discussion about rape ...
- - I feel like I m about to open Pandoras  box .
  - Yep . Half the time it s just someone saying yep
- - Is it hazardous  or is it something I can spray out doors with no mask

- - That was me  I love that stuff .
  - Thanks  And have you read the PC article on mineral makeup  It gave me some lulz . Very reminiscent of the oil cleansing article .
- - Do nt worry  I m casual too . I m so casual  whenever people talk about AC  I assume it s Animal Crossing instead of Assassin s Creed .
  - STORY OF MY LIFE  Animal Crossing is the best ... I have however been neglecting my town due to Fantasy Life and Omega Sapphire .
  - same here ... I m afraid to go back . They might be revolting .
  - At this point do nt risk it . Tom Nook has probably become the slum lord and will have you killed the second you show up .
  - but I miss my villagers ... you know  the ones whose names I cant remember at the moment
  - Only ones I liked were Eric and Julian
  - I like Nan and I think Alex was the other ... he was a lion
  - I only remember my two  I also remember who I hate . I got on the other day and stupid Sly still has nt moved out .
  - I do nt particularly remember hating anyone . Except nook of course .
  - Nook is just trying to run a profitable business . Do nt hate .
- - That s the point of every ARPG  to grind for that perfect roll on the loot . If you do nt like that  you do nt like ARPGs .
  - i enjoy the gameplay  just not the incremental stat progression and rng drop tables .
- - Explain  my frontpage is completely customized from my subscriptions I presumed . Am I missing something 
  - He thinks you do nt belong here because you do nt conform to his opinions .
- - nothing playing with moe  i ve lost respect for him

- - I would rather take cash  and I might have an offer so can I get back to you tonight or tmm 
  - Yea no probs ill be home so hmu
- - I figure this is a solid place to ask ... How do I put a picture in a comment  I m using alien blue for what it s worth .
  - Upload to imgur and post the a link to the picture .
- - Congratulations  brother  You have one solid machine there  I m sure you will be having much  much fun with that 
  - Thanks man  It was a lot of work but definitely worth it 
- - Minimalist  that s why I want to read Walden .
  - That s why i was asking . I think those are the two types of people that can get the most out of it .
- - Is this for school  I think it would be lucrative . The very reason it is not legal is because of morality .
  - It s not even morally wrong though There s no victim
- - Hmm . I played on nightmare and I thought the gameplay was fine . Then again I never used the tactical cam .
  - Really  How did you deal with the masses of fear demons  I m trying to close rifts but they are wrecking me by chain tp fearing everything ...
- - If it s a rhetorical question then how do we answer it 
  - I deleted that bit . I meant the other word .
- - I hate to burst your bubble  but that s not the way the world works  son .
  - Keep making weak quips  and you ll never have to worry about bursting anyone s bubble .
  - Oh please  please elucidate on how the world actually works  then  genius .
  - I believe you have the burden of proof in order to substantiate your initial claim .
- - On the other hand  I m pretty sure that last two pictures you ve linked depict afterlife .
  - We d have to ask the original poster about that  as there s nothing in the artwork that really shows it either way .
- - Eh  seems just as fast as leaving and going back  not to mention the spawn will still reset when the ship drops outside anyway
  - Stupid ships ruining everything on the steppes .
- - What did it say  He deleted it so it must have been something really bad .
  - Something about sending a message or how he is doing it to see people get pissed off . The usual internet bullshit .
- - Thank you so much for the guide .
  - You re welcome but i did nt make it lol .
- - Yes . I do nt disagree with the comic .

  - Would nt count on it . Alvarez has been setting up the play action all second half . That was his bread and butter when he coached .
- - why have nt they made the splash brother flip-flop 
  - Waiting to get a deal with the sock factory so they can do a combo pack of splash brother flip flops with socks .
- - That was actually insanely interesting . I get the feeling that the guy in the video is one hell on an engineer .
  - Watch his other videos  he is .
- - Ah ok. My friends are all still just getting married . Not really at the baby stage yet .
  - Or maybe they re all still within the first trimester
- - Crop your main pic a bit up because now it cuts off the top of your head .
  - Thanks - that pic kinda is that way in the original . I think I need to take some new pics in general . So I ll work on that .
- - Why do an interview  What are the good and bad things that come of doing that  in your opinion 
  - So people will understand things from my point of view and I could show them her character and maybe give insights on why she would so this .
  - What are your thoughts of this AMA so far  I hope you get a bit of catharsis  and a bit of a sense of support .

  - Pretty early on in my drinking I knew I was nt a normal drinker . Many events confirmed this for me .
- - Ignoring the girl for a second  I m amazed they had to add an explanation of what the red light means .
  - It s because this is a temporary traffic light for roadworks . So they add the warning because the light would nt usually be there and people are stupid .

  - The same type of people that would live in Minnesota
