  - Yeah  sounds like she got burned  lol .
- - The hunger games . I used to think I d be fine if I stayed fat my whole life  turns out I was wrong . Started training ever since .
  - Nice work . Most people do nt realize how capable of changing themselves that they are because you only see yourself from one perspective .
- - What should the majority that are not violent change  It s not like they tell other people to shoot stuff up .
  - The majority is actually violent  unless you mean the majority of the minority that live in the west .

  - Exactly  this quote is pseudo-intellectual bullshit . Sounds clever  but completely obvious to anyone who gives it a moment of thought .

  - Gotcha  parental block  or governmental 
- - I see some mods on the desk there ... so these tests were done by taste  It would be interesting to see the list of their findings .
  - If you were to look closer you would notice these are unused display pieces .
- - Yeah  any Batman written by Frank Miller is most likely my most hated Batman . Like All-Star Batman . He just makes the character a total ass .
  - Except in year one . Somehow he got it right there .
- - Best nights of music at a swing event  ever . I still do nt regret how much time I spent up at the bandstand just enjoying the show .
  - I tried doing that  but just standing around and facing the band I was invariably asked for dances more often than not .
- - And when you get more practice you can paint it mexican style .
  - That was the first thing I thought of when it was done  but I believe anything more than single color painting is beyond my artistic abilities .
- - John and Brian are the only two mentioned . Surprised that Ryan was nt already listed there .
  - Jon s still on CR  which is why he s listed  not sure it makes a ton of sense to have all the past hosts up there .

  - whats a roc playlist and i can for sure check that vault of glass up

  - Sometimes I feel like I m the only person in the world who loves potato salad . Even those cheap supermarket ones  I fucking love them 
  - Plenty of people love John Cena too  you know .
- - Did he just hand the next election to the Front National 
  - The response from these European governments on this issue is giving a serious boost to parties like the Front National all across Europe .
- - I was promised Mild language and Use of alcohol in that video and I got neither - I feel robbed  but also a little hyped 
  - idk  the language was pretty mild .
- - Steiner rly  They are the only fraction using this tactics  That must be the reason why they lost so many ground . First think  then start tipping

- - LOOOL the cop who tackled her may not have even seen the knife .
  - They said in the beginning that she was armed with a knife . But you could nt have known that unless you watched it from the start .
- - I find most ASMR videos creepy and cringy at the same time . I can never watch them for long because I just ca nt relax .
  - I suppose this would fall into a variation of asmr focusing on standard narration
- - My question here is why you were working out in underwear only . Why not at least wear basketball shorts or something 
  - My room  i would be naked if i wanted . D

- - it s kroenke building it  so it s the rams .
  - But does nt Khan want a team in STL too 
  - probably not  since he s invested a fair bit in jax ... like that big ass stadium pool .
  - He seems to value what the team does on the field far more than where the field is located anyway .
- - Great in EDH  maybe standard playable 
  - God no . Taking your turn off to equip is far too large a draw back .

  - Which link were you reading  It said there were hydrogenated oils in Jif

  - I ve been living in the States for some time now .
- - So ... exactly what the quote says 
  - No  it says that all religious apparel is banned in France which is just not true .
- - Can you just hold the grenade upside down 
  - no  the hammer is spring loaded so once you let go there is nt any going back
- - Apparently this helps you get a job .
  - Haha . That s what they want you to think 
- - I d pay extra for cosmetic upgrades  but that s it .
  - Cosmetics sell  and are better for the community than pay to win . I m all for it .
- - Dances with wolves . There was a time I did nt have cable and was trying save money by not leaving the house .
  - It is a very long movie so you chose wisely . No Ben Hur to hand

  - That and a link in the sidebar or something . Anything clear enough would do

  - No problem . My gates are open and I m adding you now 
- - I always theorized it was because he was the duplicate Harry Kim  the other Voyager crewmembers had a bias of some sort against him .
  - That s probably the same reason Naomi Wildman s mother seemingly abandons her to be raised by a borg in later seasons .

  - At first I too saw chihuahua . Then it morphed into a monkey .

- - how did you tack it to the wall  cool
  - I hot glued thumb tacks to the back so you cant see whats holding it up
- - Nothing wrong with higher criticism . It s a double-standard to apply it to every text in the world  but complain when it s applied to the bible .
  - A double standard is only a problem if the Bible is like every other text . But it is not
  - What would you suggest should happen to biblical scholars  Do you think the position should nt exist in our society 
  - Biblical scholars do tons of good stuff . Higher criticism is simply not a part of that good stuff .

- - That s what he s referring to .
  - I got my comment contexts all mixed up . I accept my shame .
- - I m sure men with botched circumcisions are just overreacting and should just carry on with their sex lives .
  - So now your talking about botched circumcisions  You did nt mention that before .
  - My point is that a man with a botched circumcision is nt overreacting or having silly priorities when it affects something such as his sex life .
  - Now you re just stating the obvious . I never said anything contrary to that .
- - I m pretty sure they just commentate the highlights
  - They re at the matches  if you watch final score they cut to the commentators sometimes

  - Nice  will have to try them then . Forgot they existed 
- - do you only play outdoors  i wouldnt use these outdoors  they d get thrashed real quick

- - You ca nt really have a complete sendoff because they knew that they were going to make movies .
  - Yeah it was weird for that reason .
- - I ve seen a few of them in the arena  they were worthless . Petty sure Copper is better .

  - We have tinfoil bowls for the patties and toppings  Alternatively  we also offer lettuce wraps .
- - I m really sorry that I ca nt help  but I wanted to stop by and say that your Inquisitor is gorgeous .
  - Hahahaha  She is  man . Gorgeous and ginger  haha  Thanks 
- - why did you only see him once 
  - He mentioned elsewhere that he was living in Missouri when the baby died .
  - Thats not a reason to only see your child once ... Why did put himself in a position to live far away from his child would be my next question
  - If you read the AMA  you would see that his girlfriend dumped him  found out she was pregnant  then moved away . All while OP became homeless .

  - Second this - cold compresses on your forehead and back of your neck . Unless you have the chills  might feel nice  too . Sending you healthy vibes .
- - Pretty nice . Very anachronistic considering the setting  but that s what makes it funny .

- - I bet their fires are more deadly than everywhere else  too .
  - Yes  they certainly are . Source . Australian . Am black cat .

  - Haha  yeah . Sorry to bum you out . Maybe I should mention that in the OP
  - I hate our import laws here . But after all the bills I have I would nt be able to afford one anyway  so I m not too bugged .
