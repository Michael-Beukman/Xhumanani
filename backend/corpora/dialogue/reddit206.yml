- - MRW I try to dislodge a chicken bone from friend s throat  and then we dance to celebrate .
  - Much funnier . The original was only passable because of the overall shittiness of the actual gif
- - The question is if we re getting the regular mystery skin or the premium mystery skin  Rito please 
  - News says classic mystery gift so that should be the regular one
- - I remember when that happened to us against FSU .
  - why  why did you need to mention it
- - Do they only do Devils jerseys there  One of the ones I want done is a Hawks jersey . The other is Devils though .
  - Afraid I do nt know offhand -- obviously from the location they specialize in Devils stuff .
- - Bladedancers run at normal speed ... They only seem faster because they slash around all the time
  - That still increases how fast they get around the map and how quickly they cover distance between targets .
- - That s the ultimate answer  not the question .
  - Dammit Marvin you knew the whole time and did nt tell anyone .
- - RDJ should start making more interesting album covers again . I have Syro and it s just solid white  while this one is pretty much just solid black

  - Well  I think Tim Raines should be in  too .
- - Mario is there family name . Mario Mario and Luigi Mario
  - Nintendo has officially stated that this is nt true  despite what it was in the movie . Their last names are unknown .
- - You can really see how they re the same family as peaches  I ve eaten them straight off a tree before  they re so good fresh
  - Yep they are . Except the innards of a peach stone is poison .
- - Definitely a failure from a creative standpoint . It s just a cookie-cutter WoW clone at it s heart . The class stories were the only BioWare got right .
  - The story was the creative part . And why is being a WOW clone bad 
- - It s clear the guy choking you is about to give up . Stay strong 
  - I could feel his arms weakening . Steady ... steady ... EXPLODE

  - Magnets . How do they work  
- - Expand this to include technical and vocational schools and I m in . Let s get more people learning skills and trades .

- - So are you saying I should open one more 
  - Yeah man  You re gon na get Messi and Ronaldo in the next pack 
- - Greece and Germany share a currency . Of course they need to interfere with each others politics .
  - A million times this . Greece s actions have an effect on the EU - I m surprised more countries are nt being vocal about this election .
- - Yep . Our system is messed up .
  - How is that messed up  It would nt apply to this non-consensual example that OP is describing .
- - Well I m sorry  I did nt see it anywhere .
  - It s okay man . We all mess up sometimes . It s cool .
- - I ve had one for several years and do not baby it at all and it still is nt doing what yours is doing .

- - I m going to give this a shot tonight . Thanks for the heads up .
  - Good luck  we re all counting on you .

  - When I commented the first comment I did not see the edit  my bad .
- - I do nt think you re crazy . I ll test your theory with you  Haha that is a pretty cool concept though .
  - I mean it is something they would probably do  If it was intentional then Fall Out Boy has more tricks up their sleeve then I thought
- - If I dream of a trick for years I usually actually react to finally landing it ...
  - but then when you finally get to film it you ve probably already landed it a bunch of times already
- - Brain interface seems like a reasonable point . A cyborg is not really an animal anymore .
  - We are already can replace limps with prosthetics that controlled by nerves . Well  usually we do that for amputees .
- - Exactly it . I fixed my Volvo by taking soldering gun and holding it to each pin for a while .
  - Yup  bad solder joints . I could make a KILLING repairing these .
- - GC  NC  What do these mean 
  - Check the pinned info for the full list . GC is golden child  SG is scapegoat .
- - My bag ripped within a month . The zipper breaks constantly . I m sorry but this bag is a piece of shit . Customer service refunded me fairly quickly though .

  - I think this is the worst comment in this thread
- - Wow I just realized how much of a pretentious ass hole I sounded like posting this . Oh well its just an opinion . Sorry if I offended anyone .
  - It plays like an fps riding a bike . I played a few races could nt get higher than third place  on normal setting .
- - No not at all . I m speaking generally .
  - Well  then in general terms  yes the idea of dishonour and evil come with it .
- - Like I said  encouraging people to be fat is bad  but most fat people are nt like that .

  - Oh  there are  Any name in particular  I could give it a try .
- - Again  this was run by an independent non-profit charity organization . Not the Danish Government . It was just stationed in Denmark primarily .

  - Nuts would be super easy  Not sure why I did nt think of that haha

- - So we are supporting the blue ppl or anything that is nt fed

  - Yeah  guess youre right . Eh  but now I feel weird . Feelings  gross .

  - That would be awesome . Could you give me a feedback on that  would be very helpful . Thanks in advance 
- - He s saying he s gon na kill you  or someone else . Why ca nt you kill him in self defence 
  - Because saying something is nt doing something . Are you a child

  - You could try crafting one . It s impractical and costs much gold  but it works .
- - Does the engaged dude have huge feet

  - Oh man . Throwing your Nova Bomb and then NOT seeing a message about the orbs you generated is pure public humiliation .
- - I do nt think any doctor wants that responsibility thrust upon them .
  - I would rather be in the position to make the decision than allow a politician and shadow money behind said politician .
- - So what are men entitled to expect out of women for whatever it is women want out of men 
  - An immensely enriched life through their mere presence and opportunities to play fetch .
- - They can ask all day long that s fine and encouraged but yeah they should nt be forcing it on to getting the stuff . Oh well .

- - She ran in front of a truck  dragging someone else into her mess . Kid deserves no respect or sympathy
  - I really sympathize with her struggles  but bringing that innocent driver into the mix really pisses me off too .

  - I can build fairly well . Not too bad with redstone setups . And of course  can help with ideas . Yourself

- - I ... I ... I actually feel kind of bad for Winston . That s such a freak  devastating play .
  - For real  I d just be sitting there in shock .

- - That picture of cartoon Jessie bent over on a table always gets to me
  - Not judging you . Just remember what Mordin Solus said about chafing .

  - DID SHE ASK FOR CC  No but seriously  she needed that criticism .

  - It does make it easy to hide bots in your spawn though  which is pretty nice .
- - I think Rand Paul has a good chance ... although I would love to see Amash get a chance .
  - Yeah  I think Rand is one of those that tries to pander to the libertarian base a bit  but really belongs in the GOP .
- - But at the same time he signed that deal with Edwin Jackson ...
  - Which looked good at the time . Nobody knew it would go so bad .
- - Wait what  I m not the only one 
  - Can we start a club or something  Make Mel s or something an official RBNY bar 
- - Really  I spent Friday morning collecting frozen bits of coke in my fridge from an exploded can .

  - Also the rapid pace at which human stupidity is catching up with human good will .
- - You look like you re trying to spew out as many words as possible in an attempt to look intelligent . It s not really working .
  - You look like you re using a desperate attempt to make any of my arguments invalid by drawing attention to their format . It s not really working .
- - I think I belong on the sword for a poorly executed joke .
  - No no  it was my bad for responding like it was a serious comment .
- - I did nt see that . Who would have it have been 
  - Vlasic got his stick up in ... I forget who s face it was but it was basically right in front of a ref and kinda blatant .

  - Maybe we should have purchased a vibrator for her .

  - Tumblr standard operating procedure . People are giving way too many fucks about random pointless bullshit .

  - The twins need joint anger management . It s getting out of hand .
- - Jimmy will be sleeping on the couch tonight .
  - And we all know what he ll be dreaming about
- - You do nt need an SEO expert . The first problem is that the whole point of a dev site is that it should be blocked to search traffic .
