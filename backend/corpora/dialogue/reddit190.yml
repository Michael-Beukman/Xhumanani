  - you can walk around a little in something like a hotel room . most is done with your ship .
- - Oh good  this same rehashed complaint .

  - Giroud reacted because Onuoha pushed him towards Robert Green whom were both running in a sprint thus endangering them both .

- - Like always  Just stop MM at supreme and try to play something else unless there s a ban wave or some shit .
  - I guess you are right . going to only play ESEA from now on .

  - Can you provide evidence that you do nt proclaim he does nt exist 
- - Still not grounds to assault someone even if it is true which I really doubt .
  - She assaulted him . I m sure he did nt consent to her cheating on him  getting herpes  and giving it to him .
  - Yeah it s not the same thing and there no evidence that even happened .
  - Viruses have extremely specific DNA . This can be proven forensically with a high level of accuracy .
- - agreed . and there s also a literacy factor . neither literacy nor media is the same .
  - Not that I am a poet . But I am both literate and socially awkward . A perfect formula for unintentional creepiness Hahaha
- - I am getting wet just thinking about that inside me ...
  - Got me hard reading that . Feel free to pm me .
- - And  what would make you think that 
  - Well she has nt been able to pick off the rest of her toenails .

  - Ok well they were breaking the rules or youre lying .
- - You write well . You make me wish for more languishing short stories in my NBA news .
  - thank you sincerely . i do not anticipate it happening soon because I am still practicing and this thing was just a little catharsis .
- - Wilson is fast and does nt suck .
  - He also didnt have any impact until pretty late in the season .
- - Throwing into quintuple coverage is always a bold strategy .
  - ah yes  the Rex Grossman playbook .
- - I agree . There was really no reason to completely lower the boom on him like that . A simple push would have accomplished the same thing
  - Exactly . Congrats on the win by the way 
- - That statement is so very relevant to the time that I spent working in food service .
  - I want to quit so bad . But the pay to actual work ratio is so good .
- - That s what happens when you feed your dog Old Roy .
  - I fed my greyhound some Ol  Roy one time and he had the mudd butt for two days 
- - Really  I had the disappearing spawn shadows problem  but I tried in incognito and the same thing happened  even when all extensions were disabled .
  - yeah it fixed when i disabled it and was fine for loads of games  but now it s back
- - You obviously do nt understand what its like to be truly suicidally depressed .
  - You re wasting your talents as a psychic .
- - And the non lethal ending for that mission is giving Lady Boyle to a Stalker . I do nt know how I felt after completing that mission .
  - It was my favorite level  there s a duel there I think 
- - And then nothing happened . Yay company events 
  - Yeah  the deaths literally mean nothing now  makes it hard to stay invested .
- - thats how these things go it seems ...
  - Eh  GT has plenty of game left to change things . That fumble is nt a determining factor imo  but it still sucks
- - should be easier now that they are nt sitting in my freezer staring at me .
  - The dumbbells I got for Christmas mock me but I have only used them twice and that was before the new year .
- - The Deutsches Kaiserreich comments that this is an absolutely insane move . Your leader is a tyrant and a snake .
  - Your empire has no place in Asia  this is not your problem .
- - If you are not a teenager or just looking for extra cash  and think you should be able live on minimum wage  YOU FAILED AT LIFE .

- - Deathstroke knows the identities of Batman and Nightwing and has beaten both of them .
  - Wait  since when did Deathstroke know who Batman is 
  - Wait  do YOU know who Batman is 
  - It s obvious . The jawline  the access to information  the obviously strong moral code . Batman is Clark Kent .
- - Alright  Lmk when you open and I will drop them off
  - k open  sorry for the delay 
- - I dont know what is scarier . The noted situation that the game has put you in or the double DC .
  - match took place when new year started  i do nt blame them . P
- - Not gon na lie I thought this was going to be a Pokemon joke .
  - Oh my jesus I wish it was

  - Oh why did you say Age of Eden 
- - I guess it s a typo for US .
  - Doh . That did nt even occur to me .
- - Anyone who wishes on sexual acts with a minor is a rapist . Minors can not consent .
  - lolno . That s not how you rape a person .
- - You . You make me very sad . I like you . You should write more .
  - I appreciate you saying that . I write as often as I can . Reinforcement like this means a lot .
- - I ca nt help but think about the fuel costs of having those fighters fly by .
  - Pretty low given recent prices I would think . Also  Andrews Air Force Base is pretty close by .
- - The Wire  because it is not only entertaining  it also explains the flaws in modern society pretty well .
  - I ll have to agree with you . I ve seen a lot of series  but nothing stuck with me quite like The Wire .
- - Are you connected online  It might need to be updated .
  - Yes I m connected . I m just so lost as to what I m supposed to do

- - You do nt ride a ladder you climb it .
  - Not if you re being carried by someone else
- - A Million Ways to Die in the West was great  and the steaming pile of shit that was Snowpiercer is nowhere to be seen . SHENANIGANS 
  - A Million Ways to Die in the West was funny but they needed different actors for Seth MacFarlane and Charlize Theron s roles . They both really did nt fit in .
- - Yes . And Coke Zero is NOT the same as Diet Coke .
  - I actually like cherry coke zero a lot . I ll take diet coke over regular coke zero though .

  - Heh I feel ya  I would be so scared losing it . Such a cool looking skin 
- - Yea but starting goaltender is a coaches call . Unless you have a source for some alternative  torts wears it .

- - How bad for your car is drifting in the snow 
  - If you are on a slippery surface and not hitting anything it s not bad at all . Make sure to clean the snow out of the wheels afterwards though

  - Hmm im gon na ask a silly question . Reboot as in set to factory 
- - And I told you why I enjoy her and you just dismissed my opinion be cause its le crap music ad she s a slut that makes cRap
  - I m looking for the reason why a bunch of people enjoy her  which is something objective . Your opinion helps me narrow it down  I guess .
- - A weakness that is job related that you have overcome
  - If you have overcome it  it is no longer a weakness .
- - Then you do nt understand slapstick humor  and you re not the target audience . And that s okay .

- - Its a sophisticated  interlocking brick system ...
  - But we bought it at the toy store 
- - The shot is so professional and well put together ... then theres a cup in the middle of the windshield
  - Nice picture yes . Professional no . The rule of thirds is probably the most basic photography guideline and this photographer did not follow it .
  - Rule of thirds is a mere method for easy photography . I m impressed when I see a photo that is pleasing to the eye and does nt follow conventional rules .
  - Not really . Following the rule of thirds gives you a pleasing image to look and leads your eyes to see what is intended to be the subject .
- - The funniest part is you looked up how to take a screenshot
  - and yet OP has utorrent ... which i feel like not an everyday user knows how to use . or at least one that knows how to take a screenshot ...

  - Nope at that point they all lose and the bow gets disenchanted .

- - I m all good know . Thank you
  - Definitely  Let me know if there s any errors or features you want 
- - Look closely at where the little wires coming from the case buttons go to your mobo ... Make sure they re in the right place and seated all the way
  - Well  I managed to turn it on by pushing the cables into  but it is just a temporary solution
- - The message just means that someone reported you in that game  nothing more .
  - you sure  i ve only ever seen that message once and i find it hard to believe i ve not even been reported twice ...
- - This sounds go good  do you put anything else in the roll 
  - i havent experimented yet but it stands to reason that ham would go well and if you feel adventurous you could use pizza toppings in the roll
- - Sweet Mario . Is this your footy 
  - Yes  that s my footy . I m glad you like the video 
- - I love how they added the manning face to it .
  - He looks so apathetic and it always makes my day .
- - Thanks . I was wondering why he would turn on his own people .
  - He s actually a police detective  and he s undercover in that episode .
- - I hope that a Japanese team gets to worlds and beats a Korean team . The amount of backlash that team would get .
  - Wo nt happen . Their best team went to play in Korea in NLB last season and lost in the first round to amateur an team .
- - That Roma ... I ca nt tell if I like it or hate it ...
  - It looks like an ice cream brand .
- - ZJ  if you want someone to talk to about this I d be happy to help .
  - I d appreciate that . You know where to get in touch with me . And thanks  it means a lot .
- - This video contains content from SME  who has blocked it in your country on copyright grounds .

- - I like the idea would it still be manage by the current mods 
  - No  It would be independent from this sub .
- - Chief is also much faster than Voldy and could kill him before he knew what happened .
  - This really depends on how far apart the two start from each other
  - He could pull out a battle rifle and start mowing him down .
  - Voldemort could flick his wrist and disarm him with ease .
- - Our first son was a C-section . They allowed me to be in the room with my wife for it . I do nt remember such mood lighting .
  - Same here . I do nt remember it being so insidious .
- - Eternalenvy . Someday he will actually win a tournament .
  - what about the time when he won Dreamhack when was on No Tide Hunter and MLG Columbus with Speed gaming 
- - Spectacular fighter  human trash as a person . And still .
  - He is a fighter  why does everyone expect him to be a kind hearted person  His job is hurting people
- - Woolie does nt want them  but he does nt want YOU to have them either 
  - YOU did nt win  YOU did nt get to eat the pie .
- - Wait . Does he give a tiny wave with left arm 
  - na that s a bush or a tree in the background .

- - You said you do nt play an instrument  so if you could learn to play any instrument  what would it be 
  - I wan na learn to play the bass guitar I own .

- - You re a better man than me .
  - Yeah really  if it was me I d be like who cares it s the internet . OP is definately a bigger man than me .
- - He is a Colt  will go in the Hall of Fame as a Colt . Stop this stupidity .
  - He is a Bronco  and he is still playing . Why do nt we stop speculating either way and wait until he decides for himself
