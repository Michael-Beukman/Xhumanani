  - It really was nt . But at the time I thought it was the coolest  just because nobody else had it .
- - Prospective buyers outside of the ecosystem may not be entertained . They re wondering where the floor on this thing is and we have yet to find it .

  - I had to set mine to run in xp compatibility mode . Everything worked fine after that .

- - HTC One man  eh  They will never know our struggle .
  - Camera fucked up  Because my case made my back camera useless . Nice axes 
- - They would probably be sb favorites with palmer . Still amazing what they have done without him
  - haha I would nt go that far . Betting favorites over GB and SEA  No way  especially if Cards were on the road
  - With Palmer we would nt be on the road .
  - Regardless I doubt they would be betting favorites over GB and SEA
- - If Catholics can believe that the father  the son  and the holy spirit are the same thing  why not all of them 
  - An angry God and a loving God are contradictory . The concept of the trinity is not .
- - Have you read the Constitution of the United States 
  - The constitution is nt some infallible  perfectly written document . Its hypocritical in the way it treats physical property versus intellectual property .

- - hahahahaha that was the ugliest shit I ve ever seen Shaqtin
  - Just now tuning in to this thread ... This has to be in response to something Tony did right 
- - no . you ll have to wade through it all like the rest of us .
  - Clicking a mouse and reading a screen is a terrible burden . If only an online dating site did nt require that ...
- - and ... if you re still giving away keyboards ...
  - I already gave away two Model M s . I have one or two as backups  but that s it .
- - Being a racist can be fun though .
  - i suppose  but it s not really my cup of tea
- - Same with the dentist until it really really hurts .
  - i just ignore the pain and think of motorcycles
- - Got ta leave room to sign Zlatan .
  - I was under the impression Zlatan was going to be the owner  manager  captain of MLS  first Swedish club .

  - Haha . Fair enough  but I think you can do better than that

  - This is one of the many reasons we do nt give freebies .
- - He s as rich as the US government is nt trillions of dollars in debt .
  - This is completely incoherent . Wan na proof read and try again 
- - This looks like a pretty good build then .
  - Thanks  I m researching for final adjustments  but if it seems good that s cool . D

  - Sure thing . Can you please edit your post with the information asked in the main post 
- - Or he was nt . They were drinking together  she was naked  her boyfriend heard her moaning from outside and kicked in the door .
  - well obviously that means she s an evil slut letting the poor innocent man be beat up  thank you for opening my eyes
- - It s almost as though comcast does nt wa nt you to use your own wireless by obfuscating every channel with metric fucktons of xfinity noise ...
  - Man  this internet is SO SLOW  I better upgrade .
- - Have you made up a story yet 
  - This is real you can search TPD records for my arrest if you really care .
- - Just wondering out of curiosity  but why does it seem like putting down dogs is so common  I feel hear about it a lot .
  - Because animal lovers love their animals only when they are young and healthy .
- - And that s why we mash B when we catch Pokemon .
  - It makes the pokeball work better  and there is nothing you can do to change my mind .
- - That ... took a surprising turn . Did she marry you for your great problem solving skills 
  - Lol not at all  it was nt until years later that we got together . Pretty sure she s tried to just block that memory of me
- - Pope  Russian meteor  marathon bombing .
  - Yeah . But then there wasnt anything much other than that . Like this year there was a lot more going on
- - What was the impetus for the leadership transition

- - As a person who does nt follow the BPL ... this is fucking hilarious .
  - almost as hilarious as your form ayy lmao
- - Have you ever felt guilty about being one of those people that posts song lyrics in their status updates 
  - Never done that  i dont post much

  - Panda s new album is absolutely amazing .
- - Welcome to the town with the highest suicide rate .
  - Hey  My windows phone never closes apps rand
- - And that s how you get charged with threatening assault and banned from the doctor s office .
  - Not to mention being charged for carrying a prohibited weapon . Few places allows you to carry brass knuckles .
- - Using different sugars prevents crystals from being formed . Basic cooking chemistry .
  - Interesting  but I do nt know if I buy that excuse  considering many brands just use sugar or just use corn syrup .

- - Hear that  girls  I m criminally hot .
  - I m so hot it should be considered a crime .

  - Rams fans should be interesting top watch next year .
- - I see . Thanks for the insight 
  - Not a problem  Always happy to answer questions

  - Yeah  a spree killing would never happen in good old America 
- - The scoreboard on the bottom of the screen is sooo much better than the one on the side IMO .
  - I think the one on the side is easier to read  and is less obtrusive during the course if play .
- - Your comeback is as old as my asscrack .
  - YOU RE as old as your asscrack  ...
- - The damage it loses in yellow  precision shots is made up for in the explosive white  damage . So no damage is lost when choosing this perk
  - If it s the white damage that kills them though does firefly still activate 
- - Never before have I decided so quickly to fap .
  - Fapping is only a matter of when  not if .
- - I m sorry for the terrible joke . I m drunk .
  - It s ok  we still love you .

  - No  Razer  and it s wired .
- - If you were here right now I d high five then punch you in your dick head 
  - You d try  at any rate . Keep exercising your right to free speech  maybe one day you ll once again say something of value .
  - OOOOOOO good one  Dem feels  Such sad  wow
  - Your sarcasm needs more practice . You re too subtle  most people wo nt get it and think you re sincere .
- - These are not Frenchmen  but Belgian sympathizers and spies . They do not have that right .
  - Because they sympathize with us does not mean they have no rights . They are likely french citizens who yearn to be Belgian ones once more .
- - I always end up eating the entire packet in one sitting  then spend the rest of the day feeling sick D .
  - I eat mine here and there through out the day  but its always gone by the end of the night . Then I m sad until I can get more .
- - If you press the home menu on the wii u you can take a screenshot and upload it to imgur right from the web browser .
  - I actually had no idea  Thanks for the tip 
- - HOW DO YOU LEAVE THAT MAN OPEN     
  - That s called a good out of time out set .
- - i was entirely sure you were going to end your post with something to the effect that you made all that up because it sounded cool
  - What I described is an actual technology im not sure what this is with Obama .
- - Of course . Just stay behind your shield and you wo nt take s lot of the damage .
  - Alright  thanks for the all the in-depth advice . Ca nt wait to get started on this run 
- - I m already married and he s too young for me and I still feel your pain .
  - That s the comforting thing about imaginary boyfriends ; we all share this loss together .
- - What the fuck is wrong with you I still have to poop later man .
  - Oh god  I never thought about a peeking hideous face from inside the shower before . I guess we re even .
- - Or  easier yet  just watch through youtube or free .
  - Where on youtube  Got a link  Would be great if someone reliably put a HD video of the show each night up  but I ca nt see it happening
- - God damn hybrids ... They just sneak right on up at ya .
  - I drive a hybrid squad  can confirm . Its about the only thing they re good for ...
- - What was written on his left index fingernail 
  - Does nt look like any japanese character to me  but I did nt find a great angle to look at it . It may simply be an accidental mark .
- - Fantastic  Thanks for sharing . What was your vantage point to shoot this 
  - I do nt think he shot it . Not unless he works for Disney .
- - Agent Thompson  do nt address Agent Jones by his name in public 
  - Guys  I think we might be onto something here 
- - Let s keep taking out our decent TEs in a playoff game ...
  - Allen has been struggling these past couple weeks . He had some awful drops in the Cowboys game  and just that drive he had two false starts .
- - Who is this fucking idiot and why do they have that twitter handle 
  - Twitter handles are not assigned but are registered by the first one there . This should be understood by all twitter users to prevent imitators .
- - Funny you should say that ... I have a huge crush on Toto . Haha 
  - Hahaha  Perhaps if we work together we can split them up  ROFL
- - Damn that sucks  thanks for your reply . How did it turn out for you 
  - We eventually stopped talking and I started seeing someone else .
- - Are you bisexual  This is caused by a lack of testosterone while in the womb .
  - I  unfortunately am not . Mind posting the article s link here  I m really curious .
- - Oh neat  I ll have to look into it . Have you ordered your UCS version yet 
  - Not yet  but soon . SOON .
- - Could take longer due to the holidays . Just keep waiting
  - At the same time  we may get a lot more because of the holidays .
- - I was there last night and it was pretty intense . A couple punches thrown and escalated to this pretty quickly .
  - Was it just one guy that got overzealous 
- - I can say on the latter the lions player was pushed into the Cowboys kicker by another Cowboys player so that s why that one was nt called .
  - Yep  blocked into the kicker is no foul  rule is clear .
  - And the Dallas running into the kicker could have easily been roughing  as the Dallas player hit the punter s plant leg .
  - Yep  technically should have been  although that ones not so much of a difference since even the running into  was enough for a first down ...
- - It s too bad you were nt being very fun .
  - I mean  they came at me like it was real lol . I m not just gon na get killed by ladles and live with myself . . P
- - My kanji is nt so great  so if someone can give a better translation  it d be much appreciated .
  - You ve summed it up nicely actually . They say they ll start selling it again as soon as they get their hands on more curly goodness .
- - are you happy with your vacation time tho 
  - Lol  yeah I ca nt complain  and it allows me to make more money if I want to
- - You should watch Bronson if you have nt . Great film with Tom Hardy in it
  - Saw it when it came out . Brilliant film .
- - My Tuesday evenings will be filled with drunken laughter once again . I m much excite . Really  you guys always surprise me with your wit and creativity .
  - Thanks  Be sure to say hello 
- - Yeah  why would the corrupt gaming press want to have a discussion at all  They would so much rather just slander us .
  - You want to talk  they reveal themselves . Even if not productive people see who they are  and that can be highly productive .
- - Far too many to mention  also depends on categories as it could be environmental history  world history  sport history and many more .
  - I was intending it to be world history  sorry if that should have been clearer .
- - My mom uses a similar product to great success .
  - My mom bought me a similar product for Christmas . I have nt used it yet .
- - I have fully leveled plan C but I can just level murmur .
  - Plan c is very good  sounds like its up to you and your personal preference . They are all good guns .
- - This is the exact reason that people argue that core takes more skill . Reaction time  gun skill  etc .
  - I think both take skill in a different sort of way  as they are two different types of play style . . D
- - Because I solo queue d a lot  thinking I could uprank myself .
  - People solo queue to global all the time ...
- - Because I would nt want all my Instagram photos on my website . I do nt use the square format and the compression rate is repulsive 
  - True instagram api is not for photography .
- - Wut . I m an environmentalist but not a feminist . What is this person on . Oh wait  they drank the populist kool aid
  - kind of love how they do nt say how these issues are connected .
- - Wow  my first reply from blue 
  - Shhhh  Do nt get too close  he might run away  Beautiful is nt he 
- - Go online on PSS so that we can see your third pokemon
  - uh ... trying to now . Think I am online .
- - How about Raichu  Everyone wants a Pikachu but nobody ever wants a Raichu . Poor guy .
  - If this thread was about Gamefreak s most forgotten pokemon  it would definitely be Raichu .
- - Not to take internment camps and such things lightly  but it is a couple magnitudes below slavery .
  - Well they did nt happen in the same time period so I m not sure what you re comparing .
- - I m not huge on old retired coaches coming back to coach . I ca nt think of one that has had success recently .
  - I do nt think he is retired . I think he just took a year off like Lovie did .
- - At the very least link the correct damned video . Seriously  A WMM lyric vid  And who needs lyrics for Never Gon na Give You Up 
  - It s poorly synced  too  with the occasional lack of capitalization and apostrophes .
- - Carle has been pretty damn good lately . I wonder where it s coming from .
  - Mars . It s coming from Mars .
- - Very very beautiful  Great job  I got ta ask  what do you do for a living 
  - I m an Electrician . Glad you liked it 
- - Pokemon Alpha Sapphire  but then again I m waiting for money for Pokemon Bank to fight Rayquaza .
  - Got to buy this and Omega Ruby for sure .
- - Well they fucked it up for mouse first  but after the rollback  well its back to normal ... right 
  - Mouse did nt change . The latency display however got corrected and polling should be better on some systems .
- - Can we bring back the Occam s Razor posts 
  - Well I did nt mean to write this one really . I actually only did because someone on that Occam thread said they d give points to anyone who did .
- - YOU RE THE SADDEST BUNCH I VE EVER MET
  - BUT YOU CAN BET BEFORE WE RE THROUGH
  - MISTER  I LL MAKE A MAN OUT OF YOU
  - TRANQUIL AS A FOREST  BUT ON A FIRE WITHIN
- - Not as far as I know . I messaged the mods about creating one  they said a moderator would set one up  then I heard nothing .
  - Sorry  my computer broke and it s still getting repaired . I ll be making it sometime this week
- - Bluetooth is the last thing to load so you re nearly there . Try to disable virtualization in BIOS .
  - I dint see any option to disable virtualization in uefi
- - I heard that Dr. Dog was playing and I had to go
  - I was about to travel to New York to see them play together until they announced the second leg of the tour .
- - I want my fucking gift card back 
  - Hahaha . In the very very rare even that you are that kid . Lick my nuts dude . If you are nt then good joke and have a great day 
- - Thanks for the heads up  I was just going off of first listen
  - haha what d you think it was before 
- - Fuck man  at least turn Kessel over if you guys are going to put him on the grill . Holy fuck .
  - we all know he has flaws ... we dont need to read about it every other day . this is why we cant have nice things
- - Bun butts and feet are the best parts of a bunny 
  - The soft squishy cheek bit right behind the whiskers is pretty awesome too .
- - Power Forward is really a crapshoot today . I m going with Markieff Morris and Cody Zeller .
  - Thanks for the Zeller recommendation . I was nt even looking at him  but he should be strong today .
- - Definitely Jeff and Annie  I love them together and I hope that Harmon does nt forget the end of the fifth season .
  - Yeah  me too . I really hope that Jeff ends up talking about that end and admitting who really saved them down there .
- - What about Ed s speed  Both are bullet timers  but Ed s movement and attack speed are portrayed as being greater .
  - Ed is a more slippery fighter but it s kinda hard to tell who s faster .
- - Can you imagine having sex to the theme from the Bunnings Warehouse ad 
  - I won a candle set by spinning the wheel there once
- - You have a Fighting type safari with Meditite and Throh . Connect to the PSS and I ll be able to tell you what your third one is .
  - I added you both  please add back . I m not sure which Pokemon I have though .
  - You have a Fire type safari with Pansear and Slugma . Connect to the PSS and I ll be able to tell you what your third one is .
  - Ah thank you  Hmm I connected to PSS but I think it says you re offline 
- - I am really glad you posted  Thank you 
  - Hey you re welcome  I was just flexing the knowledge learned from the cinelli coffee table book I have haha
- - Hard drives should be the new standard for clarity measuring devices .
  - I ve upgraded my clarity drive to SATA though . IDE just does nt have the throughput for high SRM beers .
- - The hookah on the left is a Shika drogo . Beautiful hookah
  - No it s not . Below the photo there is a description .
- - Fantastic  though they d look better on a bluer background .
  - Thank you  I went with green because xbox  but most of my stuff is with a bluer background .
  - I meant the PS art  they should ve had that shade if blue like the cases .
  - Oh  Oops  Yeah I like more mellow colors  but I can see what you mean .
- - Banjo  I thought we were friends    
  - What would ve the other outcome have been  You flaming banjo for stealing your waifu 
- - When I first thought about it I thought of Asami as the Beast  and Korra as Belle  but I thought this fit a little better .
  - Yeah when I thought about it afterwards this works better . I may or may not have had Something There on loop all morning .
- - You should have grabbed it  texted her boyfriend the truth and then returned it .
  - How old are you to believe this is even logically possible 
- - She also has a great book on suicide .
  - Really  Whats the name  I guess I could just google it ... lol
- - how are we winning what just happened  was it klay again
  - We have the best backcourt in the league .
  - well yeah but only because the cavs traded dion
  - what the hell  no . They have been best since last year .
- - I m shocked that there are women OFFERING free blow jobs .
  - There are none . There s been like a dozen of them .
- - Solid  So I m assuming weight is no issue . The Leatherman Surge is honestly the most solid multi-tool I have come across .
  - Weight does nt bug me  I like to carry things with a bit of heft to them so I can feel them in my pocket or on my belt .
- - And only a few hours behind eastern Australia for any online games .
  - Ooh  right . I forgot about the poor Australians . I ll remember to include them when I search for players  thanks .
- - Is the lack of Dwight love because of the blowout factor 
  - Yeah . Just not feeling his minutes tonight .
- - You should keep some things to yourself haha
  - This is the internet . Anything is worth mentioning .
- - Billy Bob Thorton s character from the Fargo series ... before he got mixed up in the Fargo business . Loved that character .
  - The world could definitely use more Lorne Malvo .
- - i personally think it s amazing how we have some of the best players in the league  yet we struggle so hard to beat almost every team .
  - you do have new pieces you recently picked up that need to build chemistry with .
- - Surely you can make your argument without resorting to Skeletor or Nazis .
  - A burning cross tattoo or a fist inside a star of david would have the same effect
- - That Bama punter is something great . It sucks the punter represents giving up but damn  kid s got a leg on him .
  - Honestly if we have to lose I would be ok with it if they gave him the mvp .
- - I guess the question is whether it s better to be publicly denounced or privately denounced .
  - Well racism is for the most part unacceptable publicly . I personally prefer that outcome .
- - A old friend of mine is using his drone to photograph high school sporting events and other events in general . No idea what he s charging .
  - Waiting for the day I see a headline about a drone crashing onto a sports field during a game .
- - If you came here for the comments  turn back now .
  - Eh your comment is in the middle so I saw most of it ...
- - I think all my jeans have metal grommets  zippers  buttons .
  - Oh  yep  Did nt think of that .
- - I have a question ... If you make one of my pokemon shiny are they still nicknameable in my game  Like does it still count as my pokemon
  - Nope . I can change it to my info and nick name it for you
- - No no . SNL needs to become kids in tge hall .
  - No one could be Kids in the Hall .
- - Do you use the same size pond basket as you d use pot 
  - No  you d use a bigger one . You re after growth .
- - Smart passenger  get out of the street asap .
  - dumb passenger ... did nt wear his seatbelt
- - The same horrible Obama economy they have trashed for years 
  - Yep  that s the one . How does this guy look at himself in the mirror everyday without retching 
- - Funny  during the match I was thinking Tanahashi was in the heel role . What match should I watch to really see him as a heel 
  - Tanahashi vs Nakamura Invasion Attack . Or Tanahashi vs Okada at King of Pro-Wrestling .
- - You re a month too late for me to give a shit about your idiotic ramblings . Enjoy your life of arrogance born of stupidity .
  - You should learn the definition of words before using them . Misuse of words just makes you look stupid .
- - Sure . In my opinion the hoodie looks grimy and dirty and the shoes are childish and ugly . The pants do nt fit to my preference either .
  - Well at least I have a nice looking ... belt 
- - Love it  Just watched Blink and Angels take Manhattan the other day .
  - Those are some of my favorite episodes  They totally creep me out and I love it .
- - If a country speaks English a property owner or representative can probably ask people to leave private property .
  - Again  we have no idea why they re being asked to leave . I m sure that s relevant .
- - wicked bike  Edit . what s the foot retention 
  - the all city double leather toe straps . I ve had these pair for over five years and still going strong .
- - You can cherry pick a few examples  but jaywalking  speeding  noise ordinance are a few examples that do nt fit your narrative .
  - None of those are issues in my community . Maybe you should get involved in yours .
- - Although you got ta admit  the cheekweld with the Magpul stock was pretty awesome huh 
  - It s heavenly . I hate shooting guns without it .
- - So ... They re a girl now because they re nuts were crushed 
  - Nuts were crushed is a really shitty name .
- - You must have misread  kook  he said someone asked him to ban someone .
  - Even still it would just mean the same thing only for the other person  also he asked HIM to ban the person .
- - Remember gopro battery life is utter shite .
  - carry an extra battery  they re relatively inexpensive . that s what i do .
- - And right now you fund it if you have a TV but do nt want to watch BBC  and the poor fund exactly the same per year as the rich .
  - how much money you have shouldnt make a difference . The programming is the same no matter how big a TV you watch it on .
- - I find it hard to believe that YOU did nt already know that .
  - I thought it was a rumor . But even priest says so . Lol
- - Gundogan or Moutinho  anyone  Wouldnt they be decent enough in the pivot 
  - Gundogan would be so cheap as his contract expires soon  but i doubt he d want to play backup .
- - Ah . That makes a little more sense to me . Lol . So I can copy and import to my tasked 
  - No idea . Simple enough to recreate . Phone Off hook is under phone  BT Connected is under Net . Phone lock is under Display .
- - I do nt care how Karlos Williams did for the rest of the season  but he is doing better than Dalvin Cook today .
  - He s got the yips in the second half . Great first half though .
- - Go go gadget dick  Whip that shit out and ai nt no doubt about it . It hit the ground  caused an earthquake and power outage 
  - Jumped up with a broken back  thank god I was smokin  crack  all day  and doped up on coke and smack .
- - tbh I felt like Gleeb baited the team into a lot of the bad situations . It almost felt like there were two shot callers shouting in different directions .
  - We did have really poor communication and absolutely awful teamfighting
- - The guy on the right  he eats pussy for breakfast .
  - Lol roadhouse is a big softy who likes to take his guns apart and bring me the pieces ... I did nt become a tech by choice
- - I thought the sign was photoshopped  as it looks like there is a thin person behind her
  - Could nt move fast enough to keep that one out
- - Well  I can not imagine how the responses could be anything but universal acclaim .
  - Seriously . The people who do nt like it are wrong .
- - Recently  maybe Tropic Thunder . A lot of funny movies just get a smile  a nod  or just some air pushed through my nose . That got laughs .
  - This movie gets a pretty decent rap and it s still underrated . One of the funniest movies or the last decade IMO .
- - I do nt know why we do nt have Philly as our return man
  - Well Philly was shaky at times back there too and I think we were probably saving him for more snaps at receiver but that s just a guess .
  - He was possibly worse than Bersin at catching punts .
  - He WAS worse than Bersin at catching punts .
- - Also  people witnessed Sirius and Cedric dying . You ca nt change that .
  - Buckbeak was executed and they still saved him  Did the executioner just walk around all confused because he remembered killing him or what 
- - The problem with trying to remove the CP  is that if you could you then could remove the political activists . Either everyone gets privacy or no-one does .
  - I think there are consensus mechanisms and trust network mechanisms that could be utilised to ensure evil gets marginalized without risking suppressing freedom of communication .
- - Did you have Eels in your aquariums and what s do Eels taste like if you ve eaten them 
  - I ve never eaten an eel  but I did have a moray eel as a pet when I was a kid which was pretty cool .
- - My name is Chris too  we have to share the cake now .
  - We shall fight to the death . There will be only one Chris .
- - Oh sure  blame it on the kid 
  - this was already in the public restroom at our local park . Told him to hold it until we got home .

- - You ll have significantly more success writing a coming of age story if you find these answers on your own .
  - Everyone needs a little help  sometimes .
- - Seagal s secret wrist lock looks coincidentally similar to an arm drag that you learn early in your Freshman year of high school wrestling .

  - I work for a large property management company .

- - Balin was killed by the orcs  I believe  not the Balrog . The Balrog did the damage to Moria when it was ruled by Durin .
  - Oh he was definitely killed by the orcs but the orcs were led by the Balrog whom they worshiped as a deity .
  - I do nt think they worshipped the balrog  in fact they were scared shitless of it . It was more of a stay out of my way kind of arrangement .
  - That s what it looked like in the movie but more or less I try to abide by Tolkien s original writings for which they say they worshiped it .
- - Why did you screenshot the picture on your phone and then upload the screenshot  rather than just uploading the picture itself 
  - The picture is on Facebook . I was unable to copy the picture from Facebook to my phone . Hence the screenshot .

  - If you sit in the machine gunners position on an enemy craft  you re committing treason
- - Obstruction  and the guys in the front of the formation are offside and interfering with play
  - Right on the obstruction point  wrong on the offside one .
- - Some people say sorority girls ca nt even . I d say they can two .
  - At some point in the not-too-distant future  I m going to steal this joke and hate myself for it .
- - Now I m thinking about the Arduino kit I got for Xmas and how I might MIDI control my Vortex ...
  - Wow  You have to let me know how that goes  I ve always been frustrated with the fact that the Vortex did nt have MIDI

  - I m sure most of those did nt even have names .

  - Idk ... Dildos have always been different to me . Like a dick is a little more forgiving haha
- - California is imposing a new carbon tax on gasoline starting this month to punish us for all of the luxury driving we do  to work and such .

- - Not trying to attack you  but what are your reasons  What do you think he excels at 
  - Not OP but Poke  Poke  Poke and some sustain .
- - A list of movies that long and you do nt even put Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on it  
  - I do nt think a lot of people would have it as their movie of the year .
- - Been there for a long time . So probably not .
  - Then again skins do take a long time .
- - I m going to be That Guy  but is this a sequel to Xenoblade  Is it a remake 
  - It s a spiritual sequel . The story and universe are unconnected similar to the Final Fantasy series .
- - Do you know where I can watch or 
  - Not worthy of a response i guess ... lol .
- - Clans would just kick anyone who bothers them .
  - Does nt a near unanimous vote counter that 
- - It s the same one that people were sent codes for . My only question is . Is it unlimited  or did they put a play limit on it now 
  - I think it s unlimited  but I m not sure .
- - I heard that his Wu Tang clan ai nt nothing to fuck with .
  - I think I ve heard of them . They rap a lot about karate right 
- - aw none of my friends are using their lilly  do you have one i can borrow 
  - Sorry for late reply . you want one 
- - I personally want us to draft Kevin White of WVU and sign linemen in FA . I m not keen on trying to draft linemen since they are boom or bust .
  - Ditto with drafting linemen but our WRs lately in the draft have been a crapshoot also . Who else was really  REALLY excited for Jon Baldwin from Pitt 
- - or better  a user dedicated to identify random scenes from tv in picture form like this . if only ...
  - If I m not mistaken at some point there was a bot that did this . Or maybe it only worked with ST . TNG .
- - If hypothetically that guy never showed up to the house to try to kick them out they could eventually claim ownership of the property . Such a weird law
  - That really depends on the jurisdiction . That would nt happen anywhere in Canada .
- - I am well aware of that actually  but I could care less .
  - I  too  care a great deal about this topic .
- - If you get a skin for a champ you do nt have  will you get the champion too or can you only get skins for champs you own 
  - You can only get a skin for a champ you own .

  - Oh thank you  College students unite 
- - haha soooo plug ingles into all of my lineups you say  how about Love s value given Kyries return  Any impact

- - That gif is getting old too so you should just stop
  - yeah it s a bit of a dead horse now .
- - nope  not bullshit . i say this because i dont want it to happen ; i dont even own a gun . but i have been charged by a black bear
  - Aside from the ears  it looks so unlike a bear that I ca nt figure out how you arrived at that conclusion .
- - Or you could just put a pic of your grandfather when he was a kid through it .
  - Do nt be silly  they did nt have instagram back then  where are you going to find that picture 
- - Ask for a cup for water but get soda
  - Ok so theft is an obvious answer to getting kicked out at any establishment . Haha
- - Could also work for veteran at the gym
  - Yeah  but you d use the black angry duck since they should know better .
- - DAMN  Hotel California s an excellent choice  probably better than Stairway .
  - I might not get into the rock and roll hall of fame given my last four contributions ...
- - Early Access  or as I see it  an excuse for the devs to sell their game without bug testing .
  - Also a great way to involve the community in the development in the game  and a way to fund developers who are in a tight economical situation .
- - Just get him to keep a photo of the box on his phone maybe 
  - This one has her thinking cap on 
- - I ve used arhd since I got my phone . Any specific things you want to know 
  - By chance does ARHD support Wi-Fi calling  I searched the forum  but could nt find a definitive answer .
  - Nope no WiFi calling . Only T-Mobile based roms have it .
  - Thanks . That is what I thought  but just wanted to make sure .
- - Relapse has fairly priced records if you re a fan of any of the bands signed to them .

- - Wow  the white privilege is strong with this one .
  - How incredibly racist of you to assume someone is white

  - Hahah ouch  I like this idea . Will do 
- - I like gallade . Thunder wave  flash  false swipe .
  - Hypnosis  false swipe  mean look  taunt is better
- - They re antiquities  not urza block . Urza s Tower and Mine . Japanese is right though .
  - Thanks for the help  appreciate it .
- - Dave Nonis is bad at his job .
  - The simplicity of how true this is made me laugh  then get sad .
- - You do nt know what the word shill means do you 
  - Not driving Saturday night either  Tell us more about your booming business .
- - Chargers kicker was a better punter than this scrub .
  - It s to the point where fans saying they could kick better than that is nt necessarily hyperbole .
- - You could see a city states border next to Russia i would have captured the city state s worker instead
  - I would much rather steal from a civ to set them back .
- - Why the hell did you not click on the nexus so we can see how much HP it survived with 
  - why the hell cant you find the answer in this thread

  - She s a post op centaur you insensitive troglodyte 
- - Republicans believe that militant gays shouldnt be allowed to force innocent Christians to participate in homosexual cultural events .
  - Yeah how dare they ask for equal protection under the law .
- - If you sucked off a guy against your or his will  yeah it would be assault .
  - Nope . I m not a prude to not enjoy sucking off a guy . Cum tastes good . Get off your high horse and just admit you re a whore .
- - Good discussion . Thanks for your thoughtful response 
  - Certainly was  and I would nt have thought of it if you did nt reply in the first place .

- - How to maintain a healthy relationship with a bear using nothing but blueberry pie and a shower curtain .
  - Tie it down with the curtain and stuff the pie down it s throat until it dies of asphyxiation . Then you have a healthy relationship . p
- - Looking great  buddy  Ca nt wait to see how the final product comes out .
  - Thank you  And I ca nt either .
- - Wish I had friends to do stuff like this with  Looks really fun 
  - I was wishing I had friends to do this stuff with too ...
- - Their version of iced tea  As a Canadian I was truly taken by surprise when I ordered one .
  - As an American lover of iced  I m curious now . What s different about Canadian iced tea  and is it better 
- - Oh  true  Yes  that is a critical piece of the apocalypse .
  - The vault dwellers will write of this .
- - Totally allowed . Now the real question is  do you have to reveal the card as it goes into your hand 
  - The rule is that you must reveal any face down card when it leaves the battlefield or the game ends . Ixidron  Manifest  and Morph all apply .
- - Ovi not with Gillette anymore  Looking scruffy 
  - I ve noticed that recently . I like it 
- - I have a butterfly dress and a floppy hat
  - I have someone helping ... thanks though

- - Same here  Bay Area  Mine became half Wells Fargo and half Pizza Hut .
  - Haha . Not even close . Indiana .
- - Okay cool . At least it s getting handled .
  - yeah  he s a good guy  happy with how he is handling this .
- - No one wants a military . It s an unfortunate necessity .
  - I agree . Its a necessary evil . My issue is about having a military force we can afford rather than one we aspire to be .
- - Any game that still uses health bars and hit points . It s a dated system and time to move on .
  - I agree that most single player games should use a different system than health bars but most multiplayer games would be completely broken
- - Or when the only comment is nt gilded . WTF is up with that  ...
  - Yeah I KNOW  Well I tell ya with negative comments such as these we will never make the front page .
- - So anyone think the Colts can upset next weekend  I want to believe so much but I know how fucky they play outdoors  in January ...
  - I ve seen enough Peyton Manning playoff football to know anything can happen .
