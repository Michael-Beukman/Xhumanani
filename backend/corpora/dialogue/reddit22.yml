  - Thanks  Congrats on your weight loss as well  Keep it up . D
- - That guy was nt the thread OP .
  - I m aware of that  but he does provide a somewhat very slightly remotely funny tangent . I also answered the thread OP s action .
- - How did you get it on the notebook  That is REALLY well done 
  - Thank you  I make this kind of notebooks myself . I usually have some of my illustrations available  but these ones were especially made to order .

  - I ve posted the solution in a comment above . Hope it helps .
- - I think you should advertise to your future roommates that you are a psychopath . Just so they know what they are signing up for .
  - well  thankfully i live alone now  and will live under a bridge before i have another roommate .
- - they do ... but often times they re the boss  are nt they  Like a shift leader at burger king . Or a manager .
  - The doctors definitely have superiors at hospitals though  like the people who actually run the hospital .
- - do nt forget they have priorities . For example eu servers took ages to get fix it and finally they look good .
  - a large customer base s player experience should be higher on priority list
- - Will it be on Hulu for Xbox 
  - I do nt think so . Last I remember  no archer episodes were on Hulu . I have nt had it in almost a year  so has that changed 
- - what happens if you play one after one jaraxxus already took over 
  - it resets the life and weapon s durability .
- - Skip Bayless may be a better coach than Flip Saunders at this point .
  - I know Flip is bad  but please do nt get Skip involved in this . That would be my nightmare .
- - how come when i do this in aoc the scout stops at the first flag  is there a way to fix this 
  - Hold shift to set the flags  and let go of shift for the last click to initiate the path .
- - Assuming you can connect a screen to the mobo  try taking the GPU card out and booting without it .
  - There are nt any ports we can plug the screen in to on the mobo  unfortunately .

- - cheese  cucumber  salad cream  beetroot and salt and vinegar crisps
  - Honestly  I would kind of want to try that
- - Well push your luck  but do nt cry when force is met with gun fire .
  - The whole point is that they were met with gunfire before they used force .
- - I just realized I was blown away by common sense being used in a video game .
  - However its counter balanced by the fact he walks slower than you run

  - But do you love all kinds of diesel trucks 
  - Sounds like a question only a damn Yankee would ask 
  - Nope  A Canadian  Is that better or worse ... Eh 
- - And burying his own company s belt in the process and calling it a toy . THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS BELT IN THE WORLD . For fuck s sake  man .
  - At no point did he call it a toy .
- - Ok but where do I get wine samples sent to me 
  - Thank you  for asking the important questions
- - Well in the US guns are far more prevalent so police have more reason to believe suspects are armed than do police in other countries .

  - Yup . You will always find asses  just got ta hope you get someone that s not . RNG right 
- - Looks like a scene from interstellar  silence and all
  - I think if I edited out the star streaks out it would look even cooler
  - Could probably achieve this by going into a dark room and pointing a flashlight at the camera
  - Yeah  the only reason this happened was because it was WAY overexposed . If I did the same thing with a flashlight  it would look very similar .
- - his has NO orange ... how does that add value 
  - it should add value because they are usually orange
- - I do nt know what sort of army your country has but dissenters regularly go free during wartime . A civilian refusing to bow is not a crime even during war .
  - They go free  Where do you live  Treason is punished by firing squad in pretty much every military in the world .
- - Exactly i agree with you on that man they need to relax
  - I m Dr. Proctor  it does nt feel like I am in a position of respect though .
- - This is nt true . He untapped time vault every turn after the flips  so it obviously was not done to save time by not having to untap time vault .
  - But with five free turns he only needs to untap time vault once  not five times .
- - Does killing Trevor remove Ron as a character entirely  He could still be relevant or have clues to give ...
  - This could be interesting  do you know if either Franklin or Michael have Ron s contact details 
- - oh snap looks like Lance Storm forgot wrestling is not real and does nt understand what a heel is .
  - Or he just has respect for those that are icons in the sport and revolutionaries  such were the Road Warriors . Unlike yourself  obviously  kid .
- - Gay  I think it s more likely that they re transgender .
  - You may be right  I especially agree after seeing OP post in another comment that his friend claims to like role playing as a girl .
- - Guardians of the Galaxy was a godawful movie  that s why . It s ONLY redeeming quality was its groovy exploitative soundtrack .
  - What did nt you like about it  I went in expecting to hate it  disliked half thr characters  and still found it enjoyable
- - Being in an anime means nothing . Thats not evidence
  - Neither is being in Avatar . A cartoon .
- - And the internet must be obeyed  That is a damned fine beard  sir 
  - thanks maam  i thought it was getting a little long and getting ready for a trim . but not with this weather ...
- - What s Ragecenter  and are there any codes going around  Would love to join
  - Good streaming . Keep an eye on the comments for people with invite codes .
- - Youre right  I guess I will condone his attempt as being healthy . Drinking less  and ... drinking less .
  - Reportedly  he s switched from whiskey to wine  but he s still drinking way too much of it .
  - Dude drinks it by the bottle . His liver is a beast or is currently in an extended state of confusion .
  - Lemmy ai nt a mutant . His metabolism works the way everyone else s does . He s killing himself and we re watching him do it .
- - I like ESO  but that s just me . Most people hate it .
  - I liked it a lot . Only stopped playing it because the player count was dying off .

  - At the bottom of the left pillar I see a cat  a mouse  and a bunny .
- - What a stupid  odd way to say he s fat . Who talks like that 
  - Why was nt there a trigger warning when you called me stupid 
- - I like that CB is wearing the new hunter helm ...
  - I like that you typed CB instead of just typing Charlie Brown  because we re all so used of making acronyms out of words on these forums lol
- - I would nt be surprised if his inventory is from a weighted loot table
  - Yep . Hence why we ll never see the Gjallarhorn again lol
- - I often try to insult peoples intelligence to prove my points too .
  - When the point relies on your understanding of a word and its implications ...
- - so what about the muslims pressuring local governments to install prayer rooms and feet sinks in public amenities and institutions  where do they fit 
  - I have no idea  frankly that s not a massive concern of mine and I do nt think installing feet sinks quite compared to beheading people for apostasy .
- - are you serious  I have never met a person who liked any yoshi game other than yoshi s story .
  - Say what  Yoshi s Island is revered as one of the greatest Nintendo platformers ever . Yoshi s Story attempted something new and bombed .
- - I ll have to try your second and third ones  that looks so good .
  - Do it  Root ginger is my hero .
  - Do you just add the chia seeds for protein 
  - Yup  I put them in or on lots of things .

  - Most do nt stand up without supports anyway . . V
- - What s the prettiest pc graphics upgrade mod 
  - That was kind of random  this is an Xbox sub
- - Not the only carriers dude . And they re only really famous in the US .
  - As Ryanair does nt even operate in the US  I doubt it is only famous there . So what are you talking about  Air Bosnia 
- - What a coincidence . I ve been binge watching Wonder Years on Netflix for the past two days .
  - So have I  and oddly enough just today I was talking about will visiting my mom because an actress on the TV looked like her .
- - Cats fucking climb on my car and other cars in my parking area because of the warm engine .
  - It makes me sad that some cats do nt have warm  safe pizza boxes to sleep on .
- - Mainly because of misrepresentation . Hurts their image a lot saying that he was NYCFC player on loan at Man City  not a Man City player who will join NYCFC .
  - and so much of their promo material was about Lamps .
  - In whatever store in NYC selling jerseys and shirts your options are Lampard and maybe Villa He s been it on marketing
  - Correct . I was in NYC three weeks ago and saw a few Lampard jerseys in stores .
- - It s genetics man  just keep letting it grow
  - alright then  maybe the blank will see what the others are doing and catch up .
- - Do you think you would be able put font over a wooden back ground like that without it getting too lost in the grain lines

  - That s cause everybody wants to be black .
- - Hard light . I called no burn valus earlier  let s see if I can keep it going .
  - No burn valus was nt a surprise . It was what was expected . The order of the Nightfall s with the exception of Omnigul has stayed the same .
- - Really unlikely that they would choose another criminal case . The format was intended to be more omnibus .
  - Why would nt it be a criminal case  that s partly why it was so popular . At the very least it will be a mystery .
- - Is there anything u can do against a full build mundo and seju while they both have thornmail xD
  - Botrk bt vamp sceptre furor boots mercurial and janna support with mikaels and frost Queen and locket shield and ardent censor has never failed me yet ... Otherwise buy zhonya
- - That is because its called Vaseline glass .
  - Vaseline glass refers to a specific colour of uranium glass .

  - The only fixer-upper fixer that can fix a fixer-upper is
- - Great  Thanks so much  this has been super helpful .
  - No problem  good luck building your pc 
- - You literally play members of a non-canon house who rule over a non-canon land made up by TTG .
  - Aha  Fair enough  my bad for not doing the research .
- - He s pretty harsh on it . I thought the art design was really cool to look at and the gameplay was serviceable .
  - the combat was subpar though . not being able to combo into different enemies was an ... odd design choice
- - That s possible too  but it s just wires and contacts  so most likely no  unless you accidently did something to it .
  - reinstalling drivers worked  CS . GO runs  Thanks so much 
  - np  enjoy your system  nice build .
  - found out the exact issue . It was nvidia shadowplay the whole time .
- - The first week of my cut I usually make strength gains  after that they stagnate

- - There s also the Dyslexia trait  which scrambles the positions of the areas .
  - Where have you heard that  According to the wiki  the game  and anywhere else I ve seen  dyslexia only affects text and is only a cosmetic trait .
- - Any notes on if this has been completed  I would like the details if not .
  - Hey  This is still available . I ll PM you .
- - I never heard anyone person tasting with their nose it sounds odd . You smell with your nose .
  - Smells lead directly into tastes . Ive seen things where chefs get their nose covered while they eat and ca nt tell the ingredients .
- - What need do they fill  JR Smith is a less talented Dion Waiters .
  - Shumpert perimeter defense . JR bench offense that Dion was nt really giving consistently .
- - Yes  the only reason medieval knights did nt fly .
  - Well it was also because of being accused of witchcraft would end you up on a nice little bonfire .
  - Assassins Creed taught me those bonfires only make you go higher .
  - I believe that in the Christian belief system  they do in fact send you up above .
- - Now the real question is if that works on engrams as well . I d love to see a purple drop turn into three .
  - No  shoot to loot does nt work on engrams .

  - Let me check with her . I am new here but I will attempt to send you a direct message with that info .
- - Depends on the look your going for really . Oh and the vibrate on the steel is a bit quieter yet just as powerful from the results ive gotten anyway
  - Good to know . If it boils down to looks it s not too much of a concern . Just worried about specs .
- - It s basically almost a finished game as is  and the devs show no signs of giving up on it .
  - No . It is NOT finished . It has zero optimization .
- - That s why you have to go check it out in person .
  - Well I am in Chicago and it is in Madison Wisconsin  not worth the trip for a big maybe in my mind
- - Doing it wrong  sit down when you have to pee next time it s glorious  Take a load off  check your phone  standing is for suckers .
  - Not worth it half the time . Either drunk  in a rush  too cold to sit  or just want to take my chances with the aim
- - theyd arrest her but she s too fabulous
  - she really is you know . takes a lot of confidence to pull that off .
- - I tend to hum  often Twin Peaks theme .
  - I hum all the time  never tried the Twin Peaks theme though .
- - Luke is honouring his father by accepting the blade  hence my comment about the Christian cross . Neither of them are honouring the death itself .

- - You re just as bad as terrorists .
  - Could you explain yourself instead of just making a bullheaded comment

  - There s breaking down a door  and then setting a door on fire and mailing the splinters to the carpenter who built it .
- - It s like I m talking to a brick wall 
  - But wait  Fangio at HC and Shanahan at OC is the only thing that ll work with this situation we re in . I m joking I got your original post
- - its a bit different though when you re there and witness it and then have to walk away from their dead bodies in order to get help .
  - Pretty sure I would see that and lose it and just sit and cry for hours . Even as an adult .
- - That s no true  plenty of retail jobs that are nt close to being automated yet
  - I did nt say they did nt exist . I said many can be automated . Learn to read .
- - Tell me you ve seen Last Holiday 
  - It is literally my favorite movie . I ve seen so many times I can recite the dialog at will . Between that and Rent . filmed live for Broadway
- - Why worry  Opportunities like that do nt come along all that often . I would have rolled with as many of them as possible .
  - Lol  it was more of a joke . I have rolled with all of them before except Travis  and always appreciate the opportunity .
- - Can you hatch an egg for me please 
  - Certainly . I ve added you back and am online .
  - Ok  I ll get check your FC and get online .
  - Thanks for the egg . Enjoy the Scyther

- - Pretty sure he insisted on a UFO as in an alien spacecraft .
  - I understand that part  I was just saying that the incident regarding the White House would have different context to what a UFO would entail .
- - Three is hardly a sufficient sample size to be making any generalizations about atheism .
  - Yeah  but keep in mind that he s trying to make Christianity look better by making atheism look worse . Intellectual honesty left this conversation long ago .
- - Lmao  this is the first time I ve seen this . Twice in one day  seems like new year s is nt kind to some .
  - you mean people posting porn to nofap 
- - Tip for your MIL  she should have a couple listings on her etsy page so people can order from her

- - I have a few invites to Ragecenter if anybody needs them PM me .
  - yea man I could use one i ca nt find any streams that work

  - That sounds horrible  I hope he was reported .
- - Depends if Kohli is thinking about the win
  - Well he was pretty keen on chasing in Adelaide  that probably will make Smith bat longer I think
- - if you still believe the two parties are different  then you re going to have a bad time .
  - If you still think in memes  I have no reason to listen to anything you have to say .
- - Pretty sure spices are the most tightly controlled and regulated resource
  - Very few religions have specific rules about spices .
- - I agree about the rider in black  and yes my estimate was pulled directly out of my ass . But the other rider had zero chance .
  - Absolutely agree  nothing the guy in the very back could do about that  and sad to see it happen .
- - If you only read the top third of the flyer first  it seems to imply that De Blasio is having people killed .
  - If you only read the headline of anything than you have nt read it .
- - I understand  good luck man  I think trying some more cotton would definitely help .
  - Thanks for the advice  Have a god one .
