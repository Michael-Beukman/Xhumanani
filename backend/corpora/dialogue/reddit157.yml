  - Logic . She has never lost a game of tic tac toe in her life .
- - Not to make light of this situation but those are the absolute best last words for a man killed defending a satirical newspaper . What is your source for this 
  - There was a video of it on Liveleak . It should be pretty easy to find  but I m on mobile right now and do nt have the link .
- - Riot is playing the long game . They will kill CLG and Gambit slowly
  - yeah it must be a top priority for them compared to the teams who qualify for wcs

  - It s down for everyone  friend .
- - I have started to just leave games if someone AFKs .
  - Get the other working player to leave with you . Leaving the afker to sit alone .
- - We can not handle success and are melting down . Our playoff in experience is definitely showing .
  - This is what I was scared of .
- - It looks like it is alive . Good for that dog .
  - For now . edit . That came across a little darker than I intended .
- - It does nt work if it s a private person sending something through the mail . But that is good advice
  - Always require a signature  or get a PO box .
- - I appreciate your reference to ASoIaF  OP .
  - Thank you  It only felt right  to name a dead dragon after a dead dragon .
- - This is so awesome  I saw a bigger version of this a few months ago and told my SO I needed it  Haha
  - Yes  I love anything photography so this was perfect 
- - If only they knew the amount of Happy Birthdays my restaurant sings to its guests . Suck it Warner .
  - It s quite likely that your restaurant has already paid for a blanket license . Many do .
- - You ve got ta be proud of what you are with or without the approval of others .
  - Sure  but do you think that telling people they will never be accepted as normal is helping at all 
- - I smell sacks edit . wait a minute
  - Nobody is judging you here  son .
- - How is Blightsteel hard to remove  Swords to Plowshares takes care of that really easily .
  - With exile  yeah  but direct damage and destroy effects wo nt do a thing to Big B
  - Unfortunately that does nt work  Blightsteel s replacement effect makes it so that it ll never hit the graveyard .
  - And now I m one bit wiser  thank you sir 
- - oh god the last one is spot on
  - That s what made the article for me 
- - If you ve never had a Reese s . they re salty as all fuck  even by American candy standards .
  - Salt and Chocolate go together like peas and carrots . I do nt see the problem here .
- - Given that valve own steam  the chances of this happening are nil

- - What the fuck  If a sink hole opens up I d say meh
  - You re watching The Dark Knight Returns .

- - You dont get that much ammo from crates
  - I ve picked up more than one crate in a session .
- - Yes but if you read the article  no suits have ever been brought forward in this city .
  - If you read the article  then you can see that there has been a lawsuit in Hamilton from tobogganing . The Calgary bylaw is there to prevent future lawsuits .
- - They re actually called Frost Roses  and they re beautiful
  - it s very nice with the blue background  and taken with a phone camera of all things .
- - Tipping . JUST PAY YOUR STAFF PROPERLY OHMYGOD .
  - They get paid more with tips usually . If they paid the staff more the price of the food and drinks would go up  so you re not losing money .
- - My question is  if Quinn or Bevell or Cable get hired as head coaches what other assistants would potentially go with them 
  - I do nt see the assistants leaving . I see them sticking around for that sweet promotion .
- - I m really surprised that there is nt a low wall or something there . Or does that drop down to another elevation on the roof just below 
  - For real . This picture gives me that tingly feeling in my legs .
- - I dunno  I d be pretty pissed off if my wrists were fucked up this badly .
  - Well so would I . He should ve stayed Falcon .

  - She has to pinky swear to be really really double plus good from now on .
- - Let s frame this in another light . what actually makes humans fun to fight against in multiplayer games 
  - You ca nt exploit the same tactics or tricks over and over again .
- - When I eat ruffled chips I nibble away one ruffle at a time . I do nt know why .
  - I do this on occasion . It s kind of one of those things that you do when you are nt really that hungry  but you keep eating anyways .
- - It all depends on side content  did you check out secret bases at all 
  - I did my first playthrough . On my second one I decided to just burn through the story and catch up on all the side stuff after the Delta Episode .
- - Might this be better suited to a wiki page 
  - Perhaps  but for now I figured we would create a list and if anyone wants to put it onto a wiki page then they are free to .
- - It s very rare to be able to chain precision kills effectively in the crucible so it s usually not very helpful having those perks in the tree active .
  - But even one precision kill is a very noticeable reload speed increase .
- - Maybe there is an extinct race that used congealed dragon blood as a building material a la oily black stones .
  - I was actually thinking that the oily black stones were the blood of sea serpents in the same general family as dragons .
- - A used Wii board and a USB Bluetooth adaptor 
  - That actually works  Wow  What software are you using and how precise is it

  - Obviously I did  what points you to think that way
- - So you speak Simlish to them . Do you ever find yourself trapped in pools with no ladders 
  - i love the sounds of simlish . but actually it ends up sounding more like korean gibberish
- - Cardale looks like he could play Nose Guard .
  - He probably could play nose guard  or at least OLB
- - Just look at the posts in this sub
  - Oh I did nt know there was a sub for him . Thanks 
- - If it s an article about a fake skull  then it s not really that interesting of news ... This is really an article about Schrdinger s cat .
  - They sent it to the Alameda County Coroner  so we ll know what the story is soon enough .
- - What gets me is that there is no rear sight . A front post is pretty much useless without one .
  - The carrying handle is almost narrower than the size of the rear sight on the service rifle though .
- - There is  but the two refined meme refers to the stout shako .
  - Ohhh ok . I was nt aware of said meme
- - I love the flat heads instead of the balls . This makes a nape look more appealing .
  - Thanks  It s a lot less prone to bumping and snagging too
- - maybe in their self driving car department .
  - Yeah I agree  most likely use civil engineers who focused on transportation engineering
- - sounds awesome . Will make some tonight . It s so expensive to buy online .
  - There is something therapeutic about waiting for something to cook and then not using it right away . Its a good investment .
- - I m American  but I have nt yet been to Philadelphia to try an authentic one either . I also want to so bad .

  - Are you serious  Philadelphia is an incredibly historic city
- - Japanese does nt really have an L or R sound . They have something inbetween .
  - Japanese has an R sound similar to to the Spanish R sound . It does nt sound like our L at all .
- - Something screams we re not getting the full story here ...
  - I was skeptical because there is an essay where a meme should be .
- - Where did you get that imitation benchmade balisong  Or did I read that wrong 
  - Yeah  it s a clone and I m pretty happy with it . I got it fro DH Gate  I think .
- - I mean  he d be a decent back up for Montolivo . But those wages  man .
  - Until he slips and cost us third place . I rather not take the risk
- - Oh yeah  well I live in Whiterun
  - Honestly  this whole thread sounds like people talking about Skyrim lore .
- - Hey  he did it . On his own account .
  - I watched it last night and what a stroke of luck ...
- - Depends what your needs are . Do you actually need more modules or are you just itching to fill the empty space 
  - Just filling the space . I wanted some feedback from others who might have some interesting things .
- - Yes  you are truly an uneducated and ignorant rube .
  - I could nt possibly counter that excellent and well thought through argument . Your debate and discussion skills are just too advanced for me to compete with .
- - People being complacent about extreme government surveillance  and One Direction .
  - Coincidentally  the two are entirely unrelated .
- - Is taking the wither on as a community really necessary 
  - Not really  but I ll see if people care .
- - Ya  except those wo nt eat you alive if you fuck up and fall in with them .
  - Neither will piranhas unless you have an open wound .
- - Illegal immigrants are getting SSNs  drivers licenses and welfare .
  - What s wrong with anyone getting a drivers license

- - I ve been to Kyle Field  and they sold out of corn dogs .
  - Wow . I ca nt believe they would stoop to such levels to employ such dirty tactics in an effort to destroy LSU fans  morale .
- - Maybe you have to think of a memory that makes your emotions so the ring changes to the right color and pops your item out .
  - That s what I was going for . Would probably be a better fetch modus for a heart player
- - To be fair I do nt think females thank you for the speed of your erection .
  - No  they re more interested in how long it takes you to use  it . For the record  the gals call me two second Ben .
- - The opiate epidemic is up there  for sure .
  - This for sure  it s bad I ve personally known to may who have died from addiction . Not to mention those your read about each day .
  - Just to be clear  they did nt die from addiction . They died from overdose . You can overdose and not be addicted .
  - I suppose if they decided to wake up one day and use heroin injected himself and died . But the underlying cause is addiction .
- - Is there any piece of actual information in this thread or should I bail 
  - Nope  full of jokes and sarcastic alien and government coverup comments . Turn back now .

- - Nobody knows about it but those who do expect too much . We re going to hear it s repetitive with bland environments  watch .
  - Yeah  I guess . I really hope it s a good game . I like the idea behind it and the game s ultra lifelike aesthetic .
- - Keep it civil . You already posted your opinion  which you are allowed to do  but reposting it over and over is spam and against the rules .
  - It was brought to my attention and i politely conceited and stopped unlike certain individuals who are getting personal and being harassing towards me and insulting me
- - They can come out at the same time  OMG . I ve never had this happen to me . That would be amazing .
  - No idea if they can but from OPs statement I would think he meant that
- - Definitely . Some people seem to frown upon those who take advantage of government programs . But not doing so would be plain stupid IMO .
  - I ve yet to hear someone talk about it negatively yet . Maybe I hang around the wrong people  or people just do nt know about it 
- - At first I thougHt it was clever . Then I realized it may go over the heads of a lot of people ...
  - It ll go over the heads of Americans  but I think the target audience are Europeans who know world flags a bit better .
  - I know all the flags  but it still took me a while . That it s clever does nt make it a good ad .
  - There is a difference between a cool idea and an effective idea .
- - I think you are super hot  Love to see more

- - Just curious what does him calling cheats in game have to do with him doing overwatch 
  - If you believe bigfoot exists  you re more likely to see bigfoot .
- - No  I think he is referring to backwards  uneducated bigots like you .
  - So people who point out the systematic rape of a group of women are worse than the people who actually rape them  That s some logic
- - but it has been changed that way  it be ART btw its a frog not a bug
  - Picky picky  I still say they made it into a bug .
- - Do I need to buy aftermarket thermal paste or is the stuff that will come with my noctua cooler ok 
  - Noctua s thermal paste is really good . Also the differences in temps between good and exceptional thermal paste is nt massive anyway .
- - I have this annoying habit of defending my opinion . I did nt attack anyone else s  but I ll defend my own when it s attacked .
  - I actually fully agree with you  I was being ironic . Yeah  I m the same .
- - Im confused on what to do now . How are you ment to do stuff  i brought some design but cant figure out how to actually gain design and see it
  - It seems like the game does nt do anything if the menu drop-down is open . Same thing happened to me . Close it and you should see progress .
- - You should look to invest in lahm man . I can see his price going through the roof in the future
  - He ll be the highest rated RB with the best links . Pace might hurt him but I still think he ll be out of my price range
- - Thats when you swallow your pride and use your socks
  - Oh I have I work in construction . Port o John never have tp and as you can tell I have a problem remembering to check before I do my business
- - Did nt see that coming . Also  I m pretty sure Justin is more heavily muscled here than Elliot usually is  and that just seems wrong .
  - Was nt it in one of the earlier back story comics where it was implied that Justin ended up going to the dojo a lot more than Elliot 
- - With all these skeletons in my closet ... I d be asking for a terrible trip .
  - I kind of feel the same . At this point in my life  I do nt think I could do a large amount and not be afraid .
- - The Artist . It s a silent film though .
  - It s not even a foreign language film ...
- - Thank you for the enlightenment . I assumed they were just trolls .
  - It s usually used as satire but some people try too hard
- - Okay  forgive me because im australian  what the fuck is a canuck hahah - usually an NBA fan giving the hockey a watch .
  - Canuck is a term for a Canadian . Kinda like saying a kiwi .
- - I m not sure if I m looking forward to Black Desert or Gigantic more .
  - BD for sure . An experience that wo nt be ruined by a single player s shortcomings for the most part  is the better game .
- - I LOVE THE BENGALS . UNIFORMS ARE SCARY AS FUCK .
  - They remind me of some sort of cheetah BUT WITH STRIPES ... LIKE A CHEETAH IN PRISON 
- - Their food sucks but they have messed up grills . What are they eating that we do nt know about  
  - This is obviously your perception and not an actual fact .
- - Quoting Tone is like quoting the bible . It does nt mean anything and its a crock of shit .
  - I believe everything in the Bible  even the bits that contradict the other bits .
- - That seems like something you really do nt want to happen ...
  - Why  This is clearly in a grocery store and not in a hospital
  - I did not notice that ... I m dumb
  - It s okay . I had the same thought as you first .
- - How much were the tokens  They look sweet .
  - They were about a dollar each converted to Philippine peso
- - wait ... they make liquid soaps now  
  - I m sorry  but what rock did you just crawl out from underneath  They ve been around for at least two decades .
- - Mmm I want to be filled up with intellectual richness by a guy from every country .
  - Well  I like to hookup with hot guys also  lol  but that s not what I was referring to 
- - Damn man . You left some of the hardest quests for last .
  - You kind of have to  if your account is newer anyway . I m going for quest cape as well and have all the above quests remaining .
- - This is already a really impressive drive .
  - Impressively bad by the Cowboys . A stupid penalty  and terrible missed tackles
- - Appearance is pretty broad . I think it s important to dress appropriately and look neat  clean and tidy but I do nt think being physically attractive is important
  - I agree  it is broad and can mean many different things . Attractiveness can mean something different for each person as well  it is nt concrete
- - Check on my patients regularly  Wow  you do nt say .
  - I was kind of laughing about it . But  its sad that he even has to say it . Indicates there is a problem .
- - If I am in the alpha  do I get closed beta automatically  Will there be a full wipe too 
  - Closed beta is automatic ; you re in if you re in alpha . They do nt plan to do a full wipe again .
- - What are the usual desert boot complaints 
  - Little to no traction when in wet pavement mainly . I m sure others have their own .
  - I just ca nt find cdbs that fit well . Either I get heel slip or my toes being crushed . Or both .
  - Mine slip like crazy or else they re too tight around the laces . I feel like another lace hole would help . I still wear them all the time though .
- - I was expecting to see something genuinely offensive here  not this kind of mild criticism . You guys really do get outraged over some trivial bullshit  do nt you
  - Yes I take offense when people say I m sexist and so is the art and media I consume . I guess you got me .
- - Um we have pets with spell interrupts ...
  - I do nt know about you  but mine was always on cd from a previous wave ...
- - Why was this down voted so much 
  - Jij and Unidan made a bunch of alt accounts ...
- - Oh  you re one of those ...
  - Shh ... Do nt make eye contact and no sudden comments that could be vaguely construed as male privilege ... It s going to be ok .
- - Why is there skin over the guys dick 
  - It s called foreskin and since the majority of the human population does nt hack off parts of their infant boys  penises most people have them .
- - Why is this so under used  Im seeing Melo  Amare  Hill  Watson
  - I m just worried that since the game is late Watson could end up playing which would hurt Sloan
- - I tend to assume zero dependencies unless explicitly stated otherwise . But in retrospect  I suppose the polyfill notice could ve been placed in a more appropriate location .
  - I never make assumptions  I d rather know some info for certain .
- - Is Calvin Johnson still on this team 
  - Shh  do nt tell the Cowboys .
- - It s unreasonable to force him to participate in extra educational stuff  but if he has the interest  then go nuts .
  - Guess I should have been more clear from the start . But then again  I m not the one pretending to have the end-all answers .
- - Who we got  Castillo or Felder 
  - I m hoping for a good bounce-back fight from Castillo  more because I liked him on Embedded than anything else .
- - So do thunder fans not like reggie jackson 
  - Too much hero ball from him . He s like Westbrook after the Monsters stole his talent .
- - That s the point . Buy when it s low and in shit .
  - I own Honda shares . We ll see how this works out long term though .
- - Yes Victini is in my AS but now it is illegal so I cant get it into Y to change it
  - You should have a backup save state before making it shiny . Just reload it and trade it back .
- - I do nt even know what that means
  - It means you have to pull back the bit near the end until you hear a click .
- - I wish you were nt so angry .
  - i wish you would recognize why i m angry rather than dismissing it without cause .
- - What do you mean participate  I joined yesterday and the next war has nt started yet  so how would I participate 
  - Oh ok never mind I thought a war started as in participate just make sure you attack that s it
- - Is it the image or does that tiger have golden stripes 
  - He does seem a little more blonde than orange . Could be the image .
- - why did I look . I am ruined now
  - Your season is over now . It will always be over for you .
- - New or not  most bape tees do nt have a high resell value fam
  - That s fine but I would not like to lose money on a shirt . So that s why I may end up just trading them .
- - NO I DIDNT OMG THANK YOU  ARE YOU FREE TOMORROW 
  - I will be available waaaaaay late tomorrow night . Does Friday work any better for you  Or even tonight 
- - I d love for them to return  it s a damn shame that they re gone  they added much needed variety .
  - I agree . Along with the DLC maps we d have a good selection if they put them all in rotation
- - That kobo is an anagram for book .
  - so is nook  Ah wait  not quite ...
- - Everyone knows you re not supposed to apologize when you are involved in a traffic accident  cops will accuse you of accepting fault 
  - I thought that was a Chinese thing  Although driving in Markham ...
- - My birthname is the same as yours actually . I have multiple co-workers with the name so it s been easy to associate others with the name and not myself .
  - I know a gazillion people with your birth name . Just  like  a gazillion .
- - Emotion is just as powerful if not more so than logic .
  - But it is nt just as accurate .
- - Intense laps of the pool . Mind is clearer underwater .
  - So true . All it takes is a mile or two of swimming and I m stress free .
- - Glad to hear you re still around  you just sort of disappeared on me 
  - I disappeared on a lot of people . It was sudden and I m sorry . I miss playing with you guys though 
- - A lot of people argue a lot of silly things .
  - It s certainly not a bad tank  it s unmatched gun depression can make the tank very flexible  and has a decent hp pool as well .
- - Ebola is a terrible viral bomb though . It is nt that contagious .
  - maybe  but that does nt mean they could nt give the ebola victims real bombs too in hopes of spreading their body fluids all over a crowd
- - I ve never used one and you have never gone without one lol Two pieces of a different puzzle I guess 
  - Guessing you re American  It s a pretty standard thing here in the UK .
  - Traditional vs Simplified English at it s finest maybe  lol
  - I personally use filters on all my blunts because i feel as if they pull better . Also  it prevents anyone from getting it wet and closing it by accident .
- - Rutherford does nt fill me with confidence at all  oh god this might get messy .
  - Get MD Craig in  he s got a better defensive technique anyways Remember when Vettori opened a few times 
- - As a Saints fan  I feel kinda weird liking a Atlanta team so much .
  - i feel the same way about the Pelicans
- - I ve thought about that . I think finger tapping would be so much better if it was randomized .
  - It s because you come to expect a certain pattern when you listen and then because of that  it s more boring and drones on .

  - His Majesty Professor Sir Dr Mr Lieutenant Inspector MD  esquire  the fifth
- - Look no further than Prague . Beautiful city  very easy to get around and a pint is generally cheaper than a bottle of water .
  - Most beautiful city I ve been to . Also great beer  art and interesting history .
- - Extra up vote for being a Pats fan .
  - And one extra on top for presumably hating the Jets .
- - In that sense  the computer program IS the simulated world . Not a contradiction of course  just what seems a rather unconventional view of God .
  - And it can take actions . Which is that point of that thought experiment .
- - today s awesome  walked into work  and they tell me they re sending me to india 
  - By force and with a one way ticket ...
- - It took me way too long to realize there is a second dog in this picture 
  - Did nt realize it until I went back to look after reading your comment . Even then  it took me a long time ...
- - i m just interested in the frame rate on xbox
  - We re talking about HiRez here  not Ubisoft .
- - Make small goody bags for nearby neighbors and introduce yourself . Gives you a nice start to a warm relationship . Neighbors can make or break your time at the apartment .
  - I did nt think of this . Thanks for the tip  though im kinda scared of knocking on a strangers front door .
- - Someone posted the same video already and has citations for them . I think I m going to delete this thread .
  - All these things are either debunked or anecdotal . Run away .
- - Would nt this also mean he probably did nt send out a gift 
  - I do nt know . I was wondering the same thing .
- - Somethings wrong with your system America . Pay your employees  do nt rely on the customers to do it  because they wo nt if they do nt have too .
  - That s also the fun part about it . Sometimes you ll leave work with gas money . Sometimes  you ll leave with rent .
- - I think that s mea nt as a joke since you said stop bullying me  but who knows lol
  - Maybe  but it came a a second or two after i said it  so he was most likely in the process of typing it .
- - The entire game is still downloading . Hover over the game Press Options Go to info Look at download status .
  - Do I have to leave the system in rest mode or can I turn it off 
- - I play a lot of nickel  I m still learning schemes and how to play better D
  - Dafuq are you having troubles with  Your team is awesome .
- - Is this one of the clips on the Malcolm in the Middle intro  or is it just very similar 
  - As far as I know it s something from Godzilla
- - Bought it online  More than likely they had a lot of these left over so they sent you one along with it just to get rid of the stock .
  - Yeah it was bought online . Either way I m chuffed  Not opening it at all now .
- - Haha because the question is nt about emergency funds it s about mooching . You re stupid
  - Dude  my finances are great . I am not stupid . Have fun with your leech mentality .

  - I have plans for what to do with them if nobody wants them  just wondering if anybody did .
- - Are the Danes gon na pull this kid  Like do nt make him sit out to dry for another whole period  God .
  - I think it s his last year of eligibility he might want to stick it out  may never play a game in this atmosphere again .
- - I literally just signed up for the year subscription right before this and no I m so choked and do nt know what to do .
  - Finally a real MMA conspiracy . how convenient that right after boxing day and the year long subscriptions they bend us over .
- - If I were ten I d care about children not agreeing with what I say .
  - oh no  Someone on the internet called me a child  whatever shall I do .
- - That dude looks way too determined for the task at hand ...
  - Yeah  he looks a little too tight .
- - Where s the incentive to form a long-term relationship or even a marriage  The future does not look good .
  - Almost like people should do those things out of love and a desire to be with someone  instead of out of a need to survive .
- - Pipe the fuck down . It s just fucking frozen .
  - But ... Why s it that colour 
- - What restaurant  I ll be in that town soon .
  - It s at adventure park  at the top of the tram .
- - Length is fine - its the one degree of upright difference vs my normal clubs that im curious about
  - Then get them bent a degree flat .
- - shoulders and lats doubled in size . not sus at all there
  - Obviously you do nt know the difference better having a pump and not .
- - The beginning is so haunting . It s amazing how something so easy to play can be so captivating .
  - That s the great thing about coldplay . They take the simplest stuff and they compose it together really well and make it all atmospheric and aweosme .
- - Moving to guard was my thinking yes . Though he could play either tackle spot too imo .
  - He seems a bit big for the guard position .
- - We were never trading up for Mariota to begin with
  - I can always hold onto my wild dreams
- - These are adorable  Please tell me you take orders 
  - Thanks  I would nt mind taking an order . I enjoyed making these . D
- - Well  they took it down now  so ... hope you got a screenshot of it .
  - How might I post the screenshot to this thread  I have it saved as a.pdf
- - Yeah  I m definitely not a fan of the puffing out . Not on myself  at least . So I should round off the corners to avoid that 
  - Yup just barely round off those corners it s amazing how much so little will do in the overall shaping
- - I like it . I did nt listen to Venom s discography yet but I will probably listen to that album when they release it .
  - This song is nt bad  but if you have nt given their first three albums a shot that d be time much  much  much better spent .
- - Fine  I will keep trying How about The Verve
  - so long as you dont link bittersweet symphony i suppose
- - Man  I missed having SVG in the league .
  - I miss having him coach my team .
- - You make an excellent observation . I agree .
  - That is nt to take away from the article  of course 
- - But there was no lesson  you idiot . Go ahead and educate me . Something tells me you re talking out your ass  though .
  - Read again  try taking notes . Use a dictionary if necessary .
- - I wonder if there was ever an easy way to fix it  even temporarily . I got one sitting in the closet .
  - Yes  there is . If you are willing to connect to the board s serial interface .
- - Never seen that before . Those Browns fans are assholes
  - Really  They seem pretty reserved and polite considering what just happened . The guy is pretty much rubbing it in their faces  too .
- - I feel the same way but about Smash .
  - When you land the killing blow with King Dedede s forward Smash  you feel it in your soul .
- - dont kid yourself ... theyre watching it too ...
  - Maybe some . Got ta be a FRACTION of men .
- - You also need the permission of the songwriter  or whoever owns the copyright to the song  which was Sting in this case .
  - You only need the copyright owner s permission . It does nt matter who wrote it or performed it .
- - To be fair  it was assumed that the bomb card would not draw another card and if that had been the case then Jugg would be game breaking .
  - Even if it negated your opponent s draw it still would nt be game breaking IMO . It would probably still see the same amount of play as it currently does .
- - That was such a beautiful period . Just fuck . That was so great .
  - LA looks exhausted from trying to keep up with us on the breakout .
- - You said that you get feedback  but also mention buzzing . Are they two different problems 
  - Feedback may not be the proper term to use  but it sounds like a buzz .
  - Does your turntable have a grounding wire and if so  is it attached to a grounded connection 
  - It does not . I also noticed that the buzz gets worse when I turn on the TV  which is connected to the same box of outlets . Something there 
- - And again  wanting that comes off as less about striving for a better game and more about not wanting to enjoy a game that has dick jokes .
  - You can say that again and again but if you ca nt point to anything as proof  you re not going to convince anybody .
- - I dunno . Would it be fair 
  - Actually scratch that  everyone else is doing new characters  lets keep it that way .
- - That looks amazing and I m super jealous  Excellent work 
  - Thanks much  Was a lot of fun to make and the end product is totally worth it .
- - Are you sure yoy ordered an item that was in stock 
  - They were in stock at the time I ordered . One of them is showing an eta of tomorrow now . Who knows . It s fasttech . ; D
- - So Driver s Ed is going on right now . Benefit is that I can do whatever . Downside is that the school blocks imgur
  - Download hotspot shield if you are on mobile  it automatically opens a vpn and unblocks websites . D
- - How would you say Anna gives the bread to me 
  - Anna gibt mir das Brot . Das Brot gibt mir Anna . Mir gibt Anna das Brot .
- - I d go with option a ... schweinsteiger at cam is brutal because of pace
  - i guess you could put lewandowski at right cam and put gotze at the center cam
- - You re making an app  Thanks  I ll take one 
  - Ha . Brainstorming stage right now . Seeing if it s worth the time .
- - If you re on windows the phone just shows up as a camera device which holds all the photos and videos in that camera folder .
  - Doh  Of course  Thanks for reminding me 
- - Good . I wonder if this might mean less kids having packed lunches and things . That s probably a good thing .
  - Less time consuming for the parents  less costly and the school can enforce healthy eating policies . Good all round it seems .
- - I hate it when cashiers comment on my purchases . Just ring my fucking items up and leave the small talk for someone who cares .
  - I m a cashier  congrats on being part of the dehumanizing population . Honestly this comment irks me so badly .
- - Possibly not the kills but the fact you took the jet that the admin wanted too many times .
  - You re probably right . Regardless  that would also be admin abuse .
- - In a world where so many kids hate their parents  some justifiably so  some are simply entitled  ungrateful brats  you really are a good kid .
  - I d say it s always the parents  fault if their kids hate them . How could it not be 
- - F to the a to the k to the e. That spells fake now cut one open for me 
  - I did nt even bother to find out prices . I may go back Friday .
- - You must have been kicked in the noggin instead because Presti has done probably the best job possible given his orders from Bennett to not even sniff the luxury tax .
  - Nonexistent orders . He just has the prudence not to .
- - how does that help the problem with too many recorded rounds at once  at all 
  - Well then more people can not play in that specific round . Eventually they just stop the round
- - I wan na see class photos with lines connected .
  - I want to hover over nodes on the graph and see yearbook photos .
- - OMG I did nt realize it started already  Yay  How is it so far 
  - Pretty good . Funny in some parts . Totally musical .
- - All this trouble from a dirty air filter .
  - Truer words have never been spoken ... I for one have learned my lesson .
- - i can be a janitor at my school after school ... should i do it
  - I would  I absolutely loved my job  it s easy and a great after school job 
- - You could try a magic eraser if nothing else works . I would just be gentle when using it because I ve never tried the magic eraser before on joysticks .
  - I would nt use magic eraser  I d keep it simple . Qtips and rubbing alcohol .
- - Let em rip while the toilet is flushing .
  - Ooooh I should ve  I start my period in a few days though so a bit more than the typical frequency .
- - Definitely Shaq . Poldi is good and all but Shaq is younger  has a higher ceiling  and IMO is much more skilled
  - plus Podolski s only there on loan  Shaqiri s is a permanent deal
- - My car broke down and will be in the shop the day I m supposed to start my new job .
  - Somehow I read that as your cat broke down ...
- - Idk  how does dark matter work  And does our pineal gland act as an antennae as some say 
  - If our nipples can cal Tokyo  anything is possible
- - Jesus  kid . Stay out of the pool until the tattoo is fully healed .
  - She said I could wait a week . The only reason I m going to the pool is to workout .
- - Did you add the censor bar or was it in the magazine like that 
  - The magazine editors did it  I presume . Was weird to see  since it does nt seem that the model has much to be showing in that picture .
- - Charles Cross claimed a lot of things in that book that are flat out wrong .
  - That s why I m so hesitant to read that book . I do nt understand why people go by it like it s the end all be all truth .
- - he really did have a good career but that shank to tie the game in the playoffs was really bad ...
  - there was also a miss vs the dolphins in overtime i believe .
- - What exactly is a chaos draft  I have nt heard of it before .
  - Draft with a bunch of random packs from magic s history  rather than one of the official draft formats .
- - Do nt forget that Tobias is an albino black man .
  - Or just a black man with a skin condition . Also that was sort of an aborted subplot .
- - I think this could be awfully taxing on the poe.trade servers ; You might want to consult with the Web Dev about it .
  - Second this  actually ... I would nt be surprised if it limits robos actually . If it did nt  it will soon .
- - I m Canadian in a Canadian educational system actually  and that s acting like I m not allowed to enjoy history and look into this shit myself .
  - If you had an interest  and were nt an ignorant fool  you would nt have made  an ignorant comment . Get fucked
- - I clicked on here  and nothing happened
  - You re supposed to click over it .
- - Wait  should nt hasbro teach the lesson with their satanic legal team 
  - Definitely  I will file the complaint 
- - Anyone happen to have a ROOT Sports stream  Only been able to find Tampa feeds  I need my Drunk Errey fix .
  - People can hate all they want  but he entertains me .
- - I loved ScHoolBoy Q s set there 
  - ScHoolBoy Q performed at the Sherwood Court .
- - This song has come a long way from when he first showed it . I really like it now .
  - Really  I like his live version much more than this overproduced thing . The raw tone of his shows contributes a lot to the humor IMO .
- - I m super busy with trades  possibly two European trades tomorrow  but since our trades only take an hour I ll let you know if there s a window .
  - Sure . I m not in a huge rush right now  so we can take our time . Just let me know if you end up in a window .
- - The source is the top comment Mr. Mathers
  - I would nt trust Mr. Matthew s porn reviews  he just announced he s gay on an interview with Dave Skylark .
- - I m sorry that other people here have been mean . If you would be willing  we d love to have you write some impressions on people that need them 
  - I am not the best at impressions  but it is worth trying 
- - Just wondering what civilian attire compares to an ABU . The wording seems unnecessary .
  - Casual and work cloths I would guess . Not somewhere that everyone is very dressed up .
- - Thanks for the rewards guy . We should be the pne thanking YOU for making a great game 
  - Remind me I owe you gold  I m only on mobile  Apologies
- - Kansas City Ice Center in shawnee serves beer .
  - They have an outdoor rink too which is kind of nice .
- - Has Tate been in for Pittsburgh after his fumble 
  - Yeah he was in on at least one play after that
- - It s totally possible we missed that . I ll look into it after lunch .
  - Thanks once again for all the hard work .
- - Not only because he stopped  but also because he had a hold of the defender s facemask .
  - The defender also pulled his jersey prior . Clear pass interference .
- - Seems like a bit of a drifter to me . Maybe he does nt want to be found .
  - Well he found the perfect place to disappear into . He looks like half the people I see around San Diego .
- - Pretty sure she would have mentioned that when they said goodbye to one another .
  - Could be that you were only conversing with just one of the fragments she split off shortly before that scene .
- - FUCK I MISSED BORDERLANDS THE PRESEQUEL D .
  - better to just wait  i assume that in true gearbox fashion they ll be milking that game with dlc until all that s coming out is dust and blood .

  - Excellent  Report back when you do 
- - It was actually a girl though who made the tweet .
  - Oh that explains why the person who replied found it confusing .
- - Sox season ticket holder or Bruins  how s that work 
  - Bruins . It was just an added expense for that season .
- - Boyhood is so overrated it should be illegal .
  - I m replacing my original comment with this . How was it overrated  By whom  What does that word even mean 
- - Would nt it be easier to make an imgur album 
  - I did  actually . Want the link 
- - I like that  so would it collapse back into the road after charge  or fly home 
  - Yes  and then it would zip back to its starting point to wait for another car . There would be multiple ones so every car gets a turn .
- - He later broke into a nearby place for some clean underwear
  - That poor old Japanese man is probably asking were his briefs are .
- - This has spoiled my opinion of Kyle .
  - I m sure this will greatly affect him
- - Is there a formal way for declaring a language to be Turing Complete  Or alternately  declaring one to not be Turing Complete .
  - Generally  you write a program that simulates a turing machine .
- - I agree with all of that . Just pointing out why the OP said it . And this girl sounds pretty immature  regardless of her field of study .
  - Immature is a crime we can accept  racism  Not so much .
- - OpTic was hosting every map  OpTic is fresh garbage without them rigging host to be relevant
  - neutral host on feature station  which is why you could hear one caster telling the other to start the game repeated times . It was players hosting at Columbus though
- - Very well composed  I like the implications of hampered freedom as well  not sure if that was your intention however .
  - Thank you and yes that was my intention  I ve been working with that concept of limited freedom for some while now . I m so glad you saw it
- - Who the fuck is spanking their kids for no reason 
  - Given that research shows that spanking your kids does nt do anything productive  anyone who spanks their kids .
- - Apparently  the fact that I am not arrogant .
  - Attitude will take you a long way in this weird world  brother .
- - I d like to come if there s any left
  - sure  lmk when you ve add me .
- - Casts stones all you want but HIPAA is the law .
  - Pretty sure nothing here was a HIPAA violation .
- - Say you re older lol . . D Grow a beard if you re able to .
  - Those college girls would have never knew i was in high school if i didnt have to get my mom to drop me off at the coffee shop .
- - Being as the spinoff looks like shit already  it would be a huge mistake . Besides that they have nt really stuck to the books .
  - I agree . I thought I was the only one who hated the look of the new show .
- - South Korea  Have a safe flight 
  - Thanks for participating  That would be a nice place to visit one day
- - The awkwardness in the room as that donation was being read off ...
  - C U C K B O Y S
- - Great half from Le Coq btw  really impressed with him
  - the only slight against him is his passing  but it s compensated for by cazorla and rosicky . he s doing great in the back
- - Can you still run the ball in football 
  - We definitely should have ran it a few times there .
- - are those comments from in development  i ca nt really make sense of them .
  - Not sure  the Halo Wikia does nt have any extra info on it .
- - Can someone explain what is going on here 
  - Some heathens do nt like the feel of the wiiu discs .
- - I did nt mention cyclists cycling on footpaths once .
  - Eh great  but the article does . perhaps read it next time .
- - ca nt you just admit it was a really bad call that changed the game  seriously the picked up flag was a huge momentum swinger .
  - No chance a Cowboys fan will admit to that  my God I can only imagine what they d be doing if it was the other way around .
- - Why are you doing this anyway  I suspect it s not necessary .
  - Just because I have some libraries that are rarely used  I didnt want them bogging the site down if they went unused .
- - He d make a fine beer pong partner .
  - Except he shooting from the other room to make it fair and everyone just says you re getting carried .
- - So what about Jay s recent interview in which he essentially admitted perjury  I guess that does nt count because he only tells the truth under oath .
  - It s always helpful when you can cherry pick evidence in support of your theory .
- - Unless you re talking about afl footy  does nt it cost about the same to buy all the padding for gridiron as well 
  - Football pick up usually consists of two hand touch . There s not really a lacrosse equivalent to that . It s all or just playing catch .
- - Very nice overall . My only thought is that the tent comes out like a blob . Either illuminate the tent  or do nt include it at all .
  - I ll look into not illuminating it  thanks for your input
- - good stuff - grats on the Kickstarter too 
  - Thanks  We re very proud of that 
- - Id be okay to trade . Do you have any particular requests  I live in North Carolina .
  - my only request would be something local i guess .
- - does nt really matter  nowadays ROBLOX will actually take action against stolen games  especially if the game is getting massive revenue .
  - Can you please give me an example of ROBLOX taking action against stolen games  I ve never seen that happen before .
- - How do you decide which one to use 
  - Maybe it depends on his mood . Like a necklace that changes color depending on the mood of the wearer .
- - Maybe one day our paths will cross again on IRC ... you on Steam 
  - course I am . PM d you .
- - Someday  I will be that father . That dude sounds awesome .
  - Well  he did raise a valedictorian .
- - That s mainly what I m looking for . I just need to get used to the actual buying and selling .
  - TD does give you paper trading on the TOS platform . I would check into that for sure .
- - When did Jerry buy the Cotton Bowl 
  - He did nt ... however  they ve been playing the Cotton bowl in Arlington for a few years now .
- - In other words - if you re going to spend a pile of time in a foreign country  make sure you understand and follow the rules involved .
  - This makes sense because it s something Canadians should ve been doing anyway .
- - That s what I was thinking as well  the beam lasers just overheat too quickly and their DPS drops below the pulses once they run out .
  - Yep  beam lasers are for burst damage and pulse lasers are for constant DPS . That s what I ve found anyway .
- - What the fuck Crawford  How come you play like shit against other teams but kill us Yotes 
  - He has nt been great since the injury .
- - I m here for the the QB battle . I m a bucs fan .
  - Welcome to fun football  like I said before .
- - A real human body would bear that impact or it would explode like an egg 
  - I m guessing there would be a red stain  followed by a wet sack of pulverized meat and bones .
- - What part of Jersey  I m up in the Clifton area
  - Lol me too what car you do you drive
- - You do realize that scientology is dying right 
  - L Ron Hubbard s Grandson pretty much debunked everything recently  as if we could nt figure it out for ourselves .
- - Gary Jules  cover of Mad World . Makes an already good song even better and makes the tone and message of the song a lot different .
  - Gary Jules did not cover mad world . He wrote it and originally performed it as the lead singer for Tears for Fears . It s his song .
- - Ebron was a bad pick . Imagine Aaron Donald standing shoulder to shoulder with Suh .
  - Or Odell Beckham Junior across from Megatron .
- - the catapult sprint attack is fun to use and quite effective when followed up with the finisher
  - I use it as a form of procrastination and protection . Getting overwhelmed  Donkey kick your problems away
- - Bright and early for their daily races Going nowhere  going nowhere
  - That moment literally made me so sad that it felt just like that song .
- - My only complaint so far is that the network logo is three or four times larger than it needs to be .
  - If something happens you are going to see it ... except if it s on the lower right side of the screen .
- - The Medal of Honor is a military award only .
  - Yes  this is what I posted before

  - Sadly it does nt have one  i had already checked to see if that was a valid option
- - cool  ty . what s the end prize 
  - I do nt think there is one . Maybe if you are doing your own league you would come up with a prize .
- - Oh yeah I bet curls and humidity can be a pain . Mine is just kinda wavy frizz most of the time .
  - it s a pain  but sometimes worth it
- - But what if my finger was just a hill  Would it be able to pet a dog then 
  - As well as kill it  yes .
  - I was just tryin tah pet em  George
  - Lennie . infamous among mice as a genocidal god of destruction .
- - Are you in the telecom business by chance 
  - Sounds to me more like oil and gas . Good work though  from OP  for having the emergency funds available . I m working on that myself currently .
- - Awesome picture  Also  is your is your username a reference to the McCarthy trilogy  If so  that s awesome too 
  - Yep  I m a huge Cormac McCarthy fan . Dude is an absolute master .
- - It ll be completely fine on workboots . I never liked waterproofing spray . I d just leave it after mink oil .
  - Natural conditioning boot oil and creams have Mink oil built in  so that stuffs pretty cool .
- - Really  They let Heath come back out too  Pathetic medical staff
  - Seriously . That fumble is enough proof he is nt all there .
- - There s a mini game for spray patterns 
  - Yeah  I m away from my computer atm but there s a flash game to learn csgo spray patterns .
- - was nt he in Cop Land  that was quite an ensemble cast
  - Maybe  I have nt seen that movie in a while
- - Well  thank you for notifying me of my lack of cinematic taste . I was previously unaware of this affliction .
  - Everyone eats slop every now and then . Ca nt have surf and turf every meal .
- - He was also probably drunk while doing all of those things too though .
  - If he users alcohol an excuse it s even worse  it s failure to acknowledge choices that are absolutely his to make .
- - That was a young kid . There s no excuse in the world for that
  - Except if the guy who did it was a young kid  too  right  Right 
- - Do nt think he was gon na stay regardless of marrow .
  - Sure  its just the timing of the two is all .
- - So cute  Did you make the pattern yourself 
  - Sure did  Hand sewing the stars was the hardest part .
- - Is nt the bigger spoiler here that Jon is LC 
  - That s true  did nt notice that actually .
- - I think Cashman wants to out tank Phil Jackson . What is this 
  - Lol girardi could manage my college team to a decent record
- - I think original is a bit archaic . Its easy to forget how bland the NES games looked . I d take an All Stars version any day .
  - Sorry  of course . All-Stars is the only version I ve ever played .
- - He is about to fuck shit up .
  - Haha  he does for sure  But he keeps his cool . Kind of .
- - I think it d be cool  however  I figure it s just a rumor . ME in FOX engine would be damn sexy .
  - Playing infiltrator in a ME game with GZ s mechanics is my new wet dream
- - maybe posting location on where did you find it helps
  - oh  good call . I found it while in Virginia City  Nevada

  - Lol . Moving around too much for my camera .
- - TYL most people have more than one friend .
  - you play LoL with friends  compared to what LoL did to my friendships  I d say Monopoly was a bonding experience . P
- - Hey  you miss every shot you do nt take .
  - Unfortunately this person misses all the shots they do take  too .
- - So ... did you take pictures of said booger  Because somehow this is something that I want to see
  - I wish I did . My phone corrupted last month and I lost all my pictures and data I had on it
- - Indiana Jones in Star Wars or Han Solo in Indiana Jones  either is amazing 
  - I can picture Han watching a guy swinging a sword around and then simply pulling his blaster out in response .
- - Quand on pense que certains pays ont dj le double Royal Cheese avec bacon  mais que fait Manuel Valls bordel .

- - But  but then they have to go outside to shit .
  - YES  that s the beauty of it 
  - But  but  but but then they ll be outside and bark and ruin your day .
  - But  if they train their dog like a responsible person would then wo nt be a problem
- - Surprise Fran appearance with the short shorts 
  - This is the golden age of basketball in the state of Iowa . And this video will be its legacy .
- - Can someone please explain why this matters so much  I mean  people vote them  so thats what people want  right 
  - You feel that our elections are fair straight up and the will of the people  Really 
- - And to just add  the friction between the car and ground is lover than the force you push it with  causing it to accelerate .
  - I wish my friction with the ground was as loving as the car s . I m just jealous of what they have together .

  - Too busy celebrating a gold medal . . D
- - Which episode of Table Flip is this from

  - Not quite at that level haha but thanks 
- - Run the game s exe directly . There s no need to login to battle.net .
  - Yeah I just realized that clicking on my WoW desktop icon is nt running the exe but rather taking me to Battle.net as well .
- - I have no idea what I m looking at
  - Disposable chopsticks  the kind you snap apart .
- - I feel like most of the time Booker T had no idea why things were happening and I agreed with him
  - And he was still the best one on the announce team .
- - I like this thing where Blake s in there with the bench guys .
  - I prefer the thing where the bench guys stay on the bench and the people who know how to play basketball are on the court
- - The average score of teams which bat first and go on to win 
  - Right  because that would exclude all the low first innings scores that did nt win . Gotcha .
- - PSA . I made pizza fries . They sound and look better than they taste .
  - Oh . My . God . I hope you made enough for me  I m on my way
- - Ironic . How Euphoric are you right now 
  - how many mosques have you set fire to today 
- - So what happens when a take a hearty dump and the toilet seat is already down 
  - I m afraid there is nothing you can do . Just close that bathroom off forever and pretend it never happened .
  - Idea has flaw in it . How about every time you put the LID down
  - The lid and toilet seat would activate flush I suppose .
- - It s like she s seen into the future and then has made predictions trying to be as bad as possible .
  - She is taking the piss . Tottenham champions  fascist wanker a manager to watch   What a crock of shite .
  - they ca nt win horseshit  but winning against chelsea was ok for them too i d guess
  - That lot can be quite tricky  I bet Mourinho wishes he was playing Wenger instead .
- - Oh  cool . That d be a nice adaptation for all humans to have 
  - Honestly  after enough repetition  you learn to deal with it . There s probably some health repercussion  but who cares about that stuff 
- - Aw I hope you see him and have a magical romantic evening

- - I do nt think any of us did before this post haha .
  - I actually did for some reason haha . We had the most ridiculous revolving door at second forever
- - Are nt zucchini kind of ... big 
  - They can range from laughably small to probably unsafe to go in any human woman large  although the latter are generally poor in flavor as well .
- - Not being able to help other people with their problems .
  - I would agree . The only difference for me is that there s usually a hint of helplessness behind the frustration when I REALLY wish I could help a person .
- - I just think that the cheesing method is more fun  I m the guy who puts the bubble on Crota while the sword guy goes to town .
  - Lightbulb moment . No idea why I did nt think of that before . Suck it boomers 
- - You just let it go  WTF 
  - I am about to let go  of a completely incorrect upper they sent me
- - I think it should be saved for the best of the best weapons . However that is just my opinion .
  - Well  that would certainly be a good place to start .
- - Honestly I do nt care if the gov is snooping through my fb . If they want to see some travel pics of mine be my guest .
  - Why do you got to be the case study on why democracy fails sometimes 
- - Russians being scared of Canadians  did you go full retard just now  Good game from both teams nonetheless .
  - I was just messin around obviously . Why  you Russian 
- - Cupid is situationally very very strong . Xbalanque is situationally not complete  unusable garbage . That s the difference .
  - Whys it come off that you just regurgitate what comes into your ear . Why would you suggest putting Xbalanque with Odin anyways . They dont have real laning synergy .
- - I m not sure  but that was one of the cutest displays of Ferret play ever and I want one so badly 
  - Yeah it s definitely adorable . No debating that
- - I absolutely loved Pineapple Express and This Is The End  but it just felt like a middle schooler wrote The Interview
  - i totally enjoyed the movie  and also enjoyed This Is The End and Pinapple Express .
- - What a glorious life to live . Carpe that diem  yaknow 
  - On mine and your s dime I m sure .
- - No auto fire . Takes some of the skill out of it . Making people frantically pull on both triggers would be hilarious good fun .
  - the problem is that the hipfire critical is glitched  it doesnt work all the times .
- - Keep running it with Murray . Let him take over .
  - The defense is finally starting to wear down a little .

  - I disagree good sir . as I  my father  my uncles and my cousins all use the dick slot .
- - I bet if Denmark scores  the crowd will cheer for them . I would
  - I would too  especially if it was by Ehlers .
