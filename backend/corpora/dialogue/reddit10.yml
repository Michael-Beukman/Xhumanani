  - Honest question . How would you word it 
- - Sweet . Looks like it s missing some images though  including the image of Pearl in the driver s seat .
  - Oh  whoops  I must ve forgotten to upload that one  Anything else missing

- - Children are awesome  its when they grow up that they become a problem .

  - Does nt need to . The ink is nt where you mentioned . Also  the paint stroke does nt show up there either . Nothing frustrating about it .
- - I have this thing against mass murders  to be honest that s par for the course for US presidents though .
  - Clinton was nt that bad . Aside from Kosovo
  - you re also forgetting about the huge amounts of military aid he gave to Columbia which was used to massacre tens of thousands of civilians .
  - Yes ... yes I did forget about that
- - Maybe you have and just did nt know it  because he is such a chameleon

  - What happened in the movie that was unrealistic  when not factoring in how fucked up Chris Kyle actually was 
- - i have a feeling that either acy or early is gon na outplay tim hardaway
  - Acy maybe . I think Hardaway s percentages are going to be really ugly to look at . He ll be a one dimensional pick-up for threes and points .
- - I like the photo but I m bit sure I like the post processing . Look a little overdone and underexposed . The composition itself is great though .
  - Yeah  I ll keep playing with the split toning ... it s not right yet .
- - the only thing worse than someone who s only here for cool pvp is someone who tries to morally justify it and absolve themselves of all blame

  - I use it for both language and engineering in the same way  but I never bother with converting handwriting to text
- - The blue arrow is different from the others because it points to the only balcony without a broom . I believe OP did this because it s easy on the eye .
  - I think you are right  I found the balcony without the broom really fast because of this .
- - I take it you are one of those people who I caught making stuff up about what Zen Masters say

- - I think that s an amazing idea  even if I ca nt join in .
  - Sorry hun ... glad you like the idea though
- - I was surprised nobody else had said him 
  - Not sure even he himself can say him .
- - So if with Virgin there are no charges  I m assuming with Bell there wo nt be any as well 
  - Your best bet is to try it a couple times and then check your bill and see . I have nt heard of anyone being charged for it though
- - So you have to post to be included or just comment  Either way  I d be happy to be added to your over stuffed ENFP pool .
  - Comment . I edited my post to reflect that .
- - Right  but I think the idea is you wait for the next one .
  - And I ll definitely make a note of it . Will do . Thanks .
- - Ohh this is great  It gives me hope  I m really scared of having to wait for months or a year D .
  - I am glad it was nt a year  I would nt have been able to make it that long

  - im not saying it doesnt happen  i am saying there are ways to sort it if it does happen ...
- - That would be the best thing to happen to this country .
  - until everyone has a degree  and nobody has jobs .
- - As good a batsman as he was  who do you drop for him  Though this is why these teams are so hard . Really only no debate selection is Bradman
  - I would nt drop Hammond at all  but maybe Lara to fit Viv Richards in
- - No  the best thing they could have done is break up without invading the other person s privacy . The ends do nt justify the means .
  - The ends do nt justify the means ... I do nt think you ve put any thought into that statement .
- - No just no I beg you please no
  - It s not your choice ... I ... I m sorry . It s just I think the green apple sucks  C ... Ca ... Can you forgive me 
- - this game is a masterpiece . ca nt wait for the next episode  hope the GwG will help to make it sooner .

- - I think he s also a pretty good golfer .
  - He actually said that he had to actively relax his attitude toward golf because he was still Uber competitive about it and was nt good enough to back it up
- - I am pretty sure Prince of Persia would win . He straight up does ridiculous things like running on walls for far longer than any of the other characters .

  - Yes  I have too but it it s very difficult if they keep moving . Much simpler to just LMG it to death .
- - Typical conduct of someone who is enslaved to form
  - Nothing wrong with form . Nothing wrong with a stapler . Use a stapler on a screw  and you re gon na have a bad time .
- - make me an xbox game  and I m in
  - There should be a way to convert it . Let me check
- - Good points by all accounts . The region is very naturally defensible .

  - Nah  I could nt find my microscope
- - I hope his karma catches up to him son and he can find out how hard Bubba will let him know he is a jerk .

- - Think it s OBIS or OBIS redone  I get those but do nt have the other mods
  - I have both of them  I love them .
- - Well whatever you do make sure to get a strain very high in CBD and low in THC .
  - THC is still an important compound when dealing with the side effects of Chemo  makes them feel better and less sick from the chemicals . CBD is still important .
  - That is true . I only have very general information that may be wrong .
  - i mean cbd is good for cancer but high thc is very important and you cant really get a half and half strain on cbd  cbd is usually very low .
- - Yeah ok I ll post pictures and info after I wake up .
  - You actually posted this while sleeping  Wow

- - Remind me why you do nt work for Blizzard yet 
  - Because by your logic every big fan would deserve to work at blizz 
- - Spike had blood frequently when he was chained in Giles  bathtub
  - Well if that was enough to keep him around till the end of the series  I logically would think he might be near obese from all that blood lol .
- - Thank you for the compliment . I just wish I knew what was going on .
  - Try asking him  he could just be stressed out or something that is on his mind which is blocking his sex drive
- - Whoever is doing the organ is a badass . I heard the Game of Thrones theme earlier and I just heard the Zelda main theme .
  - Every game that s at the dome somebody says this  he is pretty great .
- - For clarification  Grimm did nt threaten to beat up the reporter  he threatened to kill him .
  - Lol  even worse and they still voted for him
- - They used to look like a spellcaster trying to render them  now they look like what you get when you cast the spell .
  - and I much prefer the old look it fit more with the deck being your spell book .
- - I was agreeing with you I was just doing it in a joking manner . I guess my sense of humor does nt translate well into plain text .
  - My bad dude  i usually have trouble distinguishing sarcasm . Not your fault

- - I do nt get it what s so special about it  It it an event Pokemon 
  - They re referring to the Hidden Ability that it has
- - Cincinnati probably has a better chance to beat Denver right  Are we routing for Cinci  Help
  - I do nt think either has much of a chance against Denver but I would imagine the Bengals have a better shot  at least if AJ is back .
- - Do you get a black screen  or is the OS visible and just completely unresponsive 
  - OS is visible  and has happened while on the internet in chrome  and also happened while playing a video game .

  - Corner to corner on a hex is twice the length of one of its triangle s sides .
