  - Unrealistic only in the sense that in real life you would nt be around after crashing to complain about how unrealistic it is .
  - Unrealistic in the sense that it does nt behave like a real airplane .
  - It probably behaves very close to the genuine article . You probably just do nt have the skills to fly the genuine article .

  - Yeah  Where s the birth certificate   WAKE UP SHEEPLE 
- - Fair enough as it s an opinion  just saying  for me  Gerrard is nt at his peak anymore but he still offers far more than Balotelli .

- - TOO BAD I NEVER DIE I CA NT DO PUSHUPS I JUST GET FAT GG
  - That s what happens when they keep feeding you .
- - When i roll  i have moments when i just want to dance and not talk to anyone  and moments when i want to talk everyones ears off .

  - AH  thanks  I feel dumb now .
- - It s pretty clear that the majority of people talking about American Exceptionalism do nt realize that we are not statistically exceptional .
  - We are in number of atomic bombs  there s only one other country that comes close .
- - Well lebrons clearly extremely smart  but your point stands .
  - I do nt think that is clear at all . Dude was reading a book aimed at teen girls before games a couple of years ago .
- - I have no respect for the baby boomer generation . They accomplished nothing  and damaged everything .
  - And have majority of the wealth because of it .
- - Kid walks in and takes case of beer  no one says anything
  - Because it was blocking one of the shots  mad funny though .
- - Wow  they did a great job . Like  damn . I mean  even the eye color matches the actual characters .

  - That actually made me chuckle . I know I ve heard that somewhere before though  but I just ca nt put my finger in it .
- - I m pretty sure it was an impersonator bro . There has been a guy going around impersonating him .

- - Outfit is fine  though I d drop the tie .
  - Alright  will do in the future .

  - I should get a Sultan but I have too many sportscars right now
- - TIL I m the equivalent of a flat chested woman .
  - I ve got like an A cup .
- - Terry is going to die in a Chelsea shirt . Plus he s arguably the best CB in the league currently .

- - It s OK  he s not Julian .
  - hahahaha yeah too bad he is nt julian casablancas .
- - from someone who does nt even drink coffee  what s the deal of drinking the bong water 
  - No idea . Bong Water is disgusting smelling  no idea why anyone would want to drink it  it literally does nothing for you .

  - It s also handy for knowing if your kids are getting into your pills .

  - Fact checking is persecution for some groups  not taking them at their word is literally saying you want to round them up and put them into camps
- - Is this about vodka or about Russian drinking habits  Because I only drink vodka  but i dont drink it regularly .
  - The post is likely about drinking habits . Most things in moderation is fine .

  - I hope if we get a robin he would use his complete Bo staff
- - The one I like is the best one .
  - That one is OK  but the one I like is better because of random feature that your favorite does nt have .
- - The team is perfect the way it is . This would not help .
  - I love this team  but we are not perfect .
- - Why make things more difficult than needs be 
  - I feel like it s simpler since you re just transferring where you screw the base on that you have detach to clean anyway  but to each their own
- - Also  those skates are frighteningly sharp . Ever seen blades of glory  That s what happens .
  - I think the Iron Lotus is against the rules in short track though .
- - It posts the source in the thread .
  - or else it gets the hose again .
- - So she said you could mess around with him and offered you both her bed . What the hell was she expecting

- - Dragons  swords  and sorcery are off limits . Racism and bigotry A-OK 
  - Is nt that racist toward dragons  A bit bigoted against sorcerers

  - I d be ecstatic with just a sealed shed with power . Ca nt even afford a concrete slab  and I m not jokin .

- - You did nt happen to buy that at uncle lees closeout sale did you 
  - No I bought it from a guy I work with
- - His footwork and poise at his size is a massive fucking advantage . He reminds of David Robinson if the Admiral was nt built like a house .
  - Give him a few years and he will be Admiral AD . He s already got a wide frame . I think his shoulders will be huge before you know it .
  - I ve always said his play style mimics Robinson more than KG or Duncan despite Robinson being absolutely ripped .
  - KG made a living with the turnaround fadeaway .

  - We just want it to be better .
- - Lol Iran  You realize it s been Sunni terrorists  what does that have to do with Iran 
  - Because that s where ISIS is  conveniently ...
  - Uhh you mean Iraq and Syria or did I miss something saying that Isis is now a Shia movement based out of tehran
  - Syria and Iraq are neighboring Iran  Iran is the real target .
- - Those in power have learned that unhappy people make for poor slaves . The best way to prevent a revolt is to pretend you are doing people a favor .
  - Which sounds good but does nt really address what I said .
- - I wholeheartedly agree  it was just an observation .
  - Still puts us at an equal number of leaders of a warrior nation . Pretty impressive  considering each clan likely follows only the most revered warrior .

  - Yeah true  but stealing a crop report is illegal  one way or the other .

- - I like you . We should be friends .
  - I dunno  I m pretty much a dick . Not many can handle my bluntness
  - There s a difference between being a dick and being honest .

  - No  you were nt  he s just an idiot .
- - When have they had lean times  Not for a damn while
  - These are older fans im thinking of .
- - Bryz is not exactly inspiring confidence so far
  - Really  He s been in great position just needs to work on the rebounds . I m pretty pleased .

  - That s not something I m super worried about so it works out in the end hah

  - She will not be winning grandson of the year .
- - I have been thinking about this story all afternoon . I still do nt know how you did nt stumble upon it yourself during that time frame
  - My freezer is a pretty grotty place . Things at the back stay there for a long time .
- - Why the fuck is everyone in this thread acting like they know the rules  The ref got it right . That was  by rule  running into the kicker .

  - Stock injectors actually just lots and lots and lots of fuel filters haha
  - Wow that s impressive  What do you run for fuel filters  Do you put any ATF in the tank 
  - I usually run AC Delco or Bosch filters . No i havent run ATF in the tank . Whats the benefit from it 
- - Justin has explained before that the reason he picked Rufus was to get out of his comfort zone .
  - why  his performance in sf is garbage . pick a top tier
  - because he received a lot of flack from the fgc for his playstyle and he wanted to show that he can play a more offensive style .
  - Well did nt work out so well .
- - Ca nt stand anything that Jai Courtney is in .
  - He is such a poor cast for Kyle Reese
- - It s more to do with infant mortality than birth rate

- - This is really cool . Too bad it s going to be removed by the mods for its irrelevance .
  - Is it some kind of reference I m not getting or 
- - no  i think anti-vaccine supporters should catch the diseases that they help spread by not getting vaccinated and die .
  - or  you know  we could not be sociopathic and just try and set a healthy precedent of educating the masses as well as possible
  - yeah but if someone is crazy  fuck em i cant make them get vaccinated so let them die . Darwinism
  - They objectively deserve to die but it s probably more beneficial to society in the long run to value human life a little more than that
- - The problem is that the verification email is not sent from your email address  so there s no way to get access to the verification code .

- - They are a vassal  not an ally .
  - So the USA controls Pakistan does it  You dont know what that word means LOL

- - How do people drive for two miles with a blinker on  Not looking at their instruments .
  - That at least makes a clicking noise .

- - At least my season tickets might be cheaper next year  right guys  ... Guys 
  - Not after Jeremy Jacobs re built the concourse

  - Selling contact  Or what do you mean 
- - That gif is horrifying . I love it .
  - It looks like he just farted in a crowded room and everyone is trying to guess what that smell is .
- - Mad Men is incredible . Second only to Six Feet Under for my favorite drama shows ever .
  - I ve tried both but have nt made it past the second episode for either .
  - Mad Men is a slow burner . Give it the entire first season .
  - I work in marketing  so I m sure it would appeal to me if I got into it .
- - Costa  I guess he s fine as long as you only go in a straight line but he s like trying to turn a transport truck
  - He s not a ballet dancer . He s a tank .
- - It s not in the set . Ugin s collector number makes it impossible .
  - Ghostfire was with the red cards in Future Sight .

  - Orange is what you wear when you support a Dutch team . I think a full orange suit would have been a lot worse . p
- - Right up there with hungry  but ca nt be arsed to make anything .
  - or worse yet  hungry but not in the mood for anything you have in the house
- - You are a fucked up individual if you believe that what he did was right ... You need help .
  - i think hes saying the reasons behind what he did were legitimate  not that was he did was right
- - Why is it Anon always has to take a big shit  Anon needs to see a gastroenterologist . These big shits are always getting him into trouble .

  - Crucify this man  This is serious business 
- - I d be worried they d fall off as you re passing the bag around
  - Unless you are violently throwing the bag around  the velcro would work fine .
- - Smashville and BF are both very neutral . I think that comes down to preference  SV is more like FD if it had a platform .
