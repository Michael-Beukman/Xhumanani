- - What are your suggestions to prevent it 
  - I think a circle or zone around the spawn that blocks enemy fire or tanks from going inside  personally . But no firing inside spawn from friendlies .

  - So close the chat and enjoy the stream  I can live with that .
- - I do nt think they actually believe this right now  but that s how it develops into something serious .
  - That s the thing . There is now a giant online community that supports their choices  and that validation during puberty is going to land them in a hospital .
- - so its safe to turn on and operate the computer with the case open like that 
  - for short period yes long time  no .
  - It ll be for however long it takes to install windows  like an hour or so  Not sure
  - A few hours will be fine but never for more than a day
- - I wish every newspaper had the moral fortitude to do something like this .
  - Yet most American outlets wo nt . That s sad .
- - You should add more fans or a grill because that system will be hot . edit . As in literally hot .
  - I did see the optional fan  will that do 
- - Only person I can think of is Cam Newton .
  - He broke the record for a rookie . I think OP was talking about just rookie records because it would be obvious .
- - Need to just go North and South 
  - That is easier said than done against Bama .
- - and you think the same goes for women 
  - The type of woman that I would want to be in a relationship  yes . Just because some women are crazy does nt mean they all are .

  - I see them  but I also see a lot of people saying they want him as HC  some even saying he s their first choice .
- - Two jurors admitted to misconduct during the podcast . Nice try  though .
  - You d be very surprised at what you hear from jurors after a trial .
- - Was going to ask if she has any balance issues but if she was born with it ... Then probably not She is cute though 
  - She s definitely less graceful from it but is still pretty good .
- - Looks like someone did the switcharoo . Fuck them . Did you get your money back 
  - Not yet . they were closed by the time I got home . I Plan going tomorrow when I get time .
- - How about not starting shit everyone knows you ca nt finish 
  - You have a time machine  The question was about how to finish the current engagement  not how to avoid it in the future .
- - Why would lightsabers have weight to them  Its only as heavy as the hilt .
  - Not necessarily weight  but resistance when moved quickly  pushing the envelope through air . Like moving an inflated balloon around .
- - Looks like that method doesnt seem to work for big models like this .
  - Ah  too bad  I wonder why model size would make a difference 
- - OK so I YouTube d ASMR ... what have you done to me ... It s like having a prolonged full body shiver ... I may be hooked .
  - It s amazing  is nt it  
- - Funny how that happens  Thank you very much 
  - Okay  I m able to trade now .
- - I never got into drugs despite my shitty-ass life and the fact that i live inside a favela .
  - I m into drugs . It s awesome .
- - Thank you . I like how you did this one .
  - Just some small stuff . Glad it works for you .
- - It s not easy to combine paranoia and attempted shaming in one post but you managed it .
  - Thanks . I m clever that way .
- - Was this song made after he recorded the video or did he record the video for the song  If it s the latter  this is doubly impressive .

  - Tile floor that runs into carpet . gon na have to pull up the carpet and replace the pad .

  - Yes  I do . There are the occasional high bounty ships in SC  and I really enjoy the interdiction process .

- - no  if it was  it would have been listing
  - And it would had been in the listing .
- - if moving the fan to every other power source does nothing  it sounds like an issue with the fan .
  - Agree with this . HIGHLY unlikely that more than one of the fan headers are faulty providing your CPU one is working fine .
- - Yes . Now keep light away from it .
  - i promise that s the first time light has touched it since I put it in that closet

- - Oh the king is back  Cz is love  Cz is life ...
  - I cried tears of joy after seeing the patch notes
- - Looks awesome I m working on planning my first build and I really like your set up a lot I may try something similar

- - Good luck with the job  buddy . Look forward to having you back .
  - Thanks pal  I ll still be around  just in short supply . . D
- - he s right  that is incredibly unknown by a lot of smashers . Interesting stuff  wonder if that works well with other characters
  - Well  he pointed out jiggs specifically at least
- - And halfway through Mac and Dennis switch parts .
  - I can see that . Dennis says that he makes a better Bruce Wayne and plays all of the Wayne parts .
- - Stevie could nt handle the banter from all the English crowds
  - They ve been singing songs abut his kids not actually being his for years  I think he can handle a few slip chants

  - Must not have been a server for long if you dont understand about tip outs

- - Were those his fucking LEGS    
  - There was nt a lot of color in that gif  but I saw ALOT of red ...
- - I m glad I watched it without any high expectations .
  - I watched it with expectations as high as the moon and I m so glad every one of them was met and exceeded .
- - Hey  are nt you the gif guy 
  - I m not gon na call myself that way  but I like doing silly things with photoshop 
- - It s just occurred to me . This comment actually makes sense if it s meant as a reply to the one above mine .

  - thanks for the info ... and they have some hills up there . I forgot to mention i m driving around central florida ... mostly flat .
- - What about exploding sheep  Is it any good 
  - It s useful in some decks but do nt dust a common anyway it s not worth it . Might come in handy someday .
- - Why  so you can run into paid whores that are only on Tinder to promote themselves 
  - Why would they bother promoting themselves  They get paid not by how many people watch their videos  but by a one time payment when the film is complete .
- - They do it because for some reason people will share them . Any publicity is good publicity to them .
  - Yeah . I guess I should call it a night . Brain s gone haywire .

  - That s funny  I think we got the same exact model . Next you are going to tell me that yours is gray 
- - Hey  what the fuck ... why are nt these Steelers flairs faded the fuck out  They done  son .
  - the one time it d be appropriate for a fade the flairs circlejerk and no one is stepping up to do it
  - Flairs should be faded as soon as a team is eliminated . At any time in the season . Period . The people have spoken .
  - You do nt speak for me . I d rather not have the incessant stupid jokes about it .
- - spend a couple weeks at a boxing gym to learn . it s worth it .
  - Boxing gyms usually are nt so expensive either . It definitely would nt hurt to get started off with the right technique
- - Ok fair point  I misremembered how the police originally came to Jay .
  - There s a lot of misremembering even about the podcast . Which really ought to show us how fallible memory is .

- - Thanks for the outside link  that is an awesome read 
  - I am glad you like it . Some people hate it  saying it is the worst game ever . And complain that the patch work takes forever . p
- - This comment offends me  I demand that you delete it .
  - ybe we should not worry about who is being offended by what we do .
  - You demanding him to delete his comment offends me . Delete it  after he deletes his .
  - But if I delete mine and then he deletes his  can I post mine again 
- - I wonder if the if the pollen could be be used in a aerosol  so its just a very quick spray  and would lower costs
  - I like the way you think . Aerosolized pollen ... RACE YOU TO THE PATENT OFFICE 
- - Great post game interview by Cam . I did nt realize he was so well spoken and generally a nice guy .
  - I m deeply saddened there was no banana pudding statements or other terrible analogies that make no sense . That is typical of him in interviews .
- - How is his hand not burnt off 
  - I used to try and do this stuff all the time  as long as you do nt just leave the flame in one spot it wo nt burn you .
- - Plants are nice  title is less nice . I d fancy the drink too  what is it 
  - Coffee  and the white and mob boss .

  - Still not working for me ... I decided to use a less than legal source instead .
- - oh  did nt realize there were rock monsters
  - Yeah  the huge epic battle sequence near the end was also historically accurate .
- - Who puts a command somewhere when they do nt know what it does 
  - A noob who thinks they are being helped
- - I dunno . Sexual orientation is nt exactly gender identity . Frankly  you can edit the text in your flair .
  - Yeah  but heterosexual and homosexual do nt exactly apply if you re genderqueer . How can I be attracted to the opposite sex of agender 
- - I turned down the volume on purpose  every second expecting an outburst on some hyper audio
  - You were the first person to actually expect it .
- - Oh  awesome  Have you seen that numberphile video where they mathematically construct the flag of some country whose name escapes me at the moment  . P

- - Which lubricant was this a review for  Asking for a friend ...
  - Your friend told me he does nt want you to buy his lube anymore . It makes him uncomfortable .
- - are nt the comics considered non-cannon anyway 
  - Technically everything but the old RPG books is canon  until it gets retconned by something in-game .
- - ROFL  fuck this run defense I have been hearing about
  - You misunderstand . This is not a traditional run attack . Your team would get wrecked too . Only ones who can handle this are usually Clemson and Georgia
- - better watch out - Murica will shoot back
  - You just have to tell them there are Muslims in Israel . Technically not a lie .
- - Ah  avoidance of the question . You bore me . Goodnight .
  - you have said nothing that warrants consideration I gave you an answer but you missed it
- - Oh man . You did nt have to do that  Thank you very much . I ll hop on there right now and take a see .
  - No worries  Check it out and I m sure your coach will be able to help you out . Let me know how it goes .
- - Because she s worse than Onodera in every way .
  - I m not saying you re wrong in every way but you are .
- - Still waiting for the US government to post something like this .
  - If I was nt trying to pay down credit card debt  I would give you gold for that one .
- - Democracy gives the people representatives that are like the people . The people are corrupt  selfish and liars  so that s what we get for representation .
  - Thanks for making the conservative argument for small government .
- - Thanks asshole now I have to watch kee and peele for the next half an hour and forget about this thread
  - Do nt act like you do nt like it
- - Most of them . But sequels are like  all Hollywood knows how to do now .
  - It s because people love familiarity and connect to it more readily . Pop songs that sample melodies they already know are a perfect example of this .
- - He s said in the past how he hates the repetitive nature of the questions asked so this is a good break for him .
  - How I feel about the questions on fm
- - Politicians are only slightly more liked than paedophiles here in the uk Emphasis on the slightly
  - That s why I love you bastards so much
- - It still boggles the mind that they got rid of momentum . Was there ever any reasoning for that 
  - Idk  but it almost seems like a given that it would be in a Sonic game . I mean  this is a mechanic that defined the original games .
- - My sub-par at best physical appearance or so how I view it
  - Do the best you can with what you ve got . Most people will see you re trying ; only assholes will hold against you things you ca nt control .
- - I think it d be fine once you ve met . But before then it s a tad odd .
