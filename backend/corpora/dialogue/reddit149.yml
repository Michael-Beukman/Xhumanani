  - I prefer punting the babies in the pool . A lot more satisfying

  - Completely . We ve just decided to take it back to the guys who built it before and see if they could solve it .
- - What was Muhammad s crimes though  The things that these murderers are doing are not the teachings of him as far as I know .

- - I feel bad for lindley  you know hes tryin his heart out but just cant get it done
  - He got thrown to the Hawks  Niners  and now the Panthers ... No time to develop any confidence
- - Cheers  I think that may be the way to go  perhaps I ll add an extra set on the second day . Thanks

- - Hmm  I could breed you one maybe because this is the only one I have .
  - Sorry for the delay  I cant seem to find it on gts .

  - Mourinho also managed Figo at Inter . He seems to always find a way to irritate Barcelona .

  - Wade s age and knees are definitely going to catch up to him in the second half .
- - To be fair  I m seeing less analog clocks all the time . Geography though  no excuse for that .

- - You want to make all top sides of stone bricks to look like that 
  - Of course he could just make a texture pack . I feel like changing one of the most versatile blocks would cause quite a stir .
  - They changed cobblestone as well  shouldnt be that much of a problem .
  - the old cobble was just awful though .
- - Oh  I thought it meant they were sick of being without an owner  Sorry 
  - No reason to be sorry lol I thought I put it in the details
- - Does anyone else find playing smash with the sound off really disorienting 
  - I have a friend who turns off the music  but keeps the sound effects .

  - I am not saying it s ok I am just trying to understand why on earth she decided to do that .

  - It s just letting you know whats going to start to hurt as you scroll farther ...

  - With a program that adds objects to gifs
- - The actors were thinking that too . That scene was improvised .
  - That is what is best about the scene .

  - Eh do one more and we can continue tomorrow . RPs do nt have to be real time
- - His logic might be that Arin has nt deleted the old GG videos with Jon in  so it s only fair to not delete his vines with Arin in .

- - It was a backwards pass . Why did they waste so much time 
  - they took cues from Big XII refs and wanted to review a play for the hell of it .
- - It blows my mind that people defend using COAL as a power source .
  - Explaining the economics of coal is nt a defense of coal . That s like saying that explaining the economics of child labor is a defense of child labor .

  - Hard to argue against longevity . But  given their body types  I probably would have guessed that Pedro would have lasted longer .
- - No  its a cognate . A false cognate is something that looks like an english word but doesnt mean the same thing . Dog meaning dog is a cognate .

  - What  who do I put my faith into

- - Except it was on a good length swinging outside off .
  - Thought you meant the other one . Yeah i have no idea  sometimes it looks way off .

  - I m with you  I was just further expanding
- - At some point  maintaining poverty will become more expensive than paying out UBI . It s simply a tipping point . And the tipping point will come .
  - I suspect that if one actually runs the numbers  one will find that the tipping point was reached decades if not centuries ago .
- - then again they were apparently worthy of being dumped ... so it might not be someone you would be interested in .
  - Lots of good people get dumped . I m a glass half full type of guy .

  - The extra soil really makes for some beautiful plants too  it s pretty fun watching them grow . I ca nt wait to see the finished timelapses of this run
- - how do i get out of the office  im stuck sitting there just talking to snape and doing paperwork 
  - Yep . You will be here almost the whole game  I m not even kidding . Game s about whoring Hermione  not travel places .
- - That is a horrible idea on how to organize the system . Hospitals would just under report sick people and then people would go untreated .
  - As opposed to people who ca nt afford health insurance being untreated anyways 
- - I m sure there s a few people who are nt very comfortable photographing their body and showing someone as well  fat or not .
  - Does nt have to be a full body shot  collarbones are a dead giveaway
- - Well I did enjoy reading about your king brown snake  but I m not sure how you got there from discussion about the weather .

  - There IS a reason why the fandom started raging like neckbeards when Armada came out ...
- - Is this site supposed to be comedy 
  - Well  it s in Kansas  so this could be the most trusted news source in the state .
- - A couple of my girlfriends worked as escorts to put themselves through university . They are both now married with kids and mortgages .
  - Do the husbands know  Would they care 
  - Yes . I thought I had answered that already 
  - Well the way you phrased it downplayed the fact that they actually had sex for money . As if the husbands only thought that they literally escorted men and nothing else .

  - One that seemed close to it but it came out no problemo .
- - Think this is fake . Or at least everyone on YouTube thinks it is fake
  - Some news sites think its fake too . Its well made but I agree . His other video has being shown a fake too .
- - Clemson  you guys gave us a hell of a game tonight . Kick ass the rest of the season  and we ll see you in the ACC Tourney 
  - No you wo nt  we re gon na lose in the first round .
- - Do blockbusters have to actually be blockbusters or can they be intended blockbusters that underperform 
  - Is that in reference to Edge of Tomorrow

  - i wan na see the police car pull it over .
- - You re very patriotic . There seems to be a lot of racial tension . Freedom is important to you . Christianity is pretty big there .
  - Honestly I believe there is considerably less racial tension than other countries we just make a bigger deal about it to shame it out of ourselves .
- - Then go look at another post instead of bitching .
  - Thanks for the advice captain douche bag .
- - Fuck look at yucca mountain . We have waste sitting in casks out in the open instead of yucca . So dumb .
  - What s wrong with them being in the open . They are easier to monitor  replace  move and recycle if they are in the open .
- - Seriously it boggles my mind that there s still sexual bigotry in the world .
  - Especially a mother disowning her child  probably religiously driven .

  - they ll drop study for his incident possibly
- - Because intelligence steal on a banish instead of follow up damage can be more useful depending on the opposing line-up .
  - But the amount of scenarios where you would pick support OD over support SD are so incredibly slim .
