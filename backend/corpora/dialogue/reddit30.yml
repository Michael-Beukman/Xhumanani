  - Ohhhh okay I see . I do nt have the same problem  not sure what s going on for you .
- - true . Eichel needed a big tournament and he was good but not amazing
  - McDavid has nt had an amazing tourney either .
- - Probably should have been focusing on the Bengals instead .
  - There is no way you re being serious ... right 
- - Are those labias for the women s sign 
  - I think the technical term is meat curtains

  - why do we deserve the best if it leads to a disaster for the rest of nature 
  - You do nt think humans are special

- - All the lamps are on little anti-gravity stands  that s pretty sci-fi .
  - And they seem to follow you around when you need them .

- - I wonder whether it will be Windows only .
  - Same . They should bring it to all platforms .
- - I ve noticed that the online sites which report income in my field grossly under report . It s like they are there for the employers .

- - So I m a bit curious  do your parents live in Alaska 
  - No  they ve been there though .
- - I would try getting the heat sink off the card and cleaning the surfaces of the GPU and sink  then re-apply thermal paste .
  - I ll give it a try  thanks 
- - Do you have any pictures I can view 
  - I wish I did  they re all film prints and they re in a different town at the moment . Sorry .
- - How could they put that in the game that ca nt be the best take .
  - I was thinking the same thing . They should ve hired someone to re-do his lines .
- - Well  not just any school day - a school day with guaranteed snowball fights every break 
  - And King of the hill on the biggest snow pile  stained with nose bleed

  - wasnt cold enuf too need a jacket but yea would have been good
- - Where do I put my hands then  I usually have them in my pockets  but I think that s not good .

- - Give him back to wherever you got him from . I think it s faulty .
  - Nah  just has his priorities straight .
- - That s a pretty good amount honestly  especially considering the hefty pension . That s more than anyone should be paid to kill innocent dogs  anyway .
  - Yeah  but usually cops get shot the day before they can retire and collect that pension .
- - OK cool . Sorry Im very computer illiterate lol . Thanks a ton for the suggestion though Ill look into it 
  - Haha  no problem . We ve all got ta start somewhere  just slowly learn the ropes and ask for help when it s needed . Good luck

  - yeah  holidays are a bit of a spanner in the works .
- - what are you driving that you are so concerned about compensating for the driver s weight 
  - Maybe OP is super huge jacked muscle man and his car is scraping on one side and he just wants to balance it out .
- - No  some dont have hair at all .
  - See Getzlaf  Ryan and Upper Lip  Sydney Crosby s .
- - Not Mike Tice dude looked like a doucher on Hard Knocks this year and Falcons o-line sucked worse than ours .
  - That s totally the reason he would nt be our line coach ...
- - Perfect  Thank you for that . I ll prob still get it for the crafter s cure daily and the broker fee  Thanks

  - Yeah . I mentioned those were just bars with great selections . That s why I put the breweries up front .
- - Not solely  depends on the game . Play g Destiny as I was getting close to dying it turned red .
  - That s the controller . He was talking about the light on the console itself .
  - Well  that was nt specifically stated  but sure . Luckily my console light has never turned red ...
  - Well it was in response to a lost of console light colors  so it kind of was heavily implied .
  - The parent comment never specifically stated that they were referring to the light on the console  so nothing was heavily implied .
  - Ir was a direct response to a comment talking about the colors on the console  it was obviously a response to that . Clear as day to me .
- - I definately dont remember any patch notes about this . I read them pretty attentively usually . Ill look bit if you find said notes id love to see a link .

  - The Kevin Switch . I mean  it s right there .
- - keys  wallet  phone  etc .
  - This is a list of the obvious things that OP already mentioned .
- - Theory of relativity translated in Latin to a roman scholar 
  - Gon na be tough to do that without calculus or zero . I doubt Newton understood calculus well enough so as to make sense of it .
- - ad thresh . sure its been done a lot  but hell if it is nt fun to one shot squishies .
  - Try Liandrys on Thresh ... its alot of fun
- - Gurian  a guest with a voice that is killing my ears  and baby boomer music nostalgia talk . What fresh hell is this .
  - Can someone please give this old ghoul a lozenge  Whatever ASMR is  this is the opposite of that .
  - Misophonia  of which Gurian is the leading cause .
  - I need a trigger warning for Gurian s existence
- - Charity . That part s decent . And washing your hands .
  - Also things I do nt need a book to tell me to do .
- - China is a lot more massive than europe
  - Europe is bigger than China by a good half a million square kilometres .
- - Priest with Shadow Word . Deaths  Mind Control  Harrison Jones  and Cabal Shadow Priests .
  - Control Priest has a decent chance to win against Warrior  but it is definitely not a counter to it .
- - Call CPS . This is flat-out neglect .
  - Yeah  the more I think about it the more I know it has to be done . But do you know what they do in cases like this

  - I use a toothbrush to clean my guitar fretboard  or really any small scrubbing task .
- - It s pretty funny how many people in here said it s definitely roughing or definitely not . IMO it s borderline and I m not upset about it .
  - Agreed . Did nt look that bad .
- - Yes . Stress does nt prevent ships from spending tokens in the Combat phase  just performing Actions on the Activation Phase .
  - That is what I thought  but I wanted to double check . Thanks for the quick reply .
- - Because that s just a bad idea .
  - Exactly . Which is why they should nt have done that .
- - He deleted the tweet because the thread got removed by mods so he then opened a new thread and that got deleted as well

  - She and I had a scheduling conflict and by the time her agent and I got it resolved  her media tour was over .
  - Ah  ok  thank you  That s all I wanted to know . Thanks for trying  anyway  sucks that things could nt work out .
- - Good point.I keep going back and forth between Cowher and Ryan . I d just rather see us get somebody in place sooner than later .
  - The problem is that nobody available is a proven offense minded coach . Cowher has been out of the league for a looooong time and Rex is another defense guy .
- - Also as a plus you are nt imitating his style . You re just copying his drawings .
  - You re right . I need to practice more .
- - I find it hard to believe you do nt realise how dumb posts like this make you and your community look .
  - I find it hard to believe you do nt realize how dumb screen names like this make you look .
- - Clean your machine man  Look at all those food bits . I would clean those things neurotically when I washed dishes .

- - Yeah I think that they should get rollover tethering or something .
  - That s a lot of data  lots of the time I do nt even use my allowance
- - Except it s a minor soft tissue wound . I ve had papercuts worse .
  - You ve had papercuts worse than something passing all the way through your finger  Either you have some ridiculous paper or your skin is just not doing its job .
- - It s good to hear a good guy tow truck driver stories once in a while . sometimes I forget that they are people  and not car stealing monster men
  - Agreed but most of them are car stealing monster men .
- - then it would be surely not  as long as the innkeeper was nt literally pimping them then he s just running a hotel business
  - I would seem easy to make hotel owner s life difficult if somebody wanted to . Kind of like a trojan horse but just with a prostitute .
- - So ... Who else is already drunk 
  - I threw my back out so I m high on Vicodin . Does that count 
- - It s usually better from an engram  perks usually end up being better . I ve gotten a few that way  one for each damage type

- - Now try it by saving fergus . Then enjoy the subtle differences .
  - I saved Fergus in my first playthrough  is there much difference in whom you save 
- - Why s it matter if it s placebo or not 
  - In my experience the effect can wear off over time .
- - He s probably one of the more attractive guys in Soton . They went out of their way to find the best looking guy and tried to make him ugly .
  - Still has the majority of his teeth - doing well for Soton standards .
- - The irony of your profile picture is amazing .
  - I just realized  Haha  My name begins in Patriot too . . D
- - I d be interested  I ve never been to one of these  It could be fun  right 
  - We ve pretty much only played hockey together as a big group  but it s usually really fun .
- - So let the market decide . Put the visas up for auction . Let the tech companies put their money where their mouths are .
  - Really  Is that how other countries handle immigration  By making it completely hard for a company to employ foreigners .
- - Love her . Just wish she would do anal .
  - I concur  Id give one of my nuts to see her do anal

  - I suppose that s a relevant analogy .
- - I believe in you  Not myself though . Definitely would not bet on myself in this situation .
  - We shall see . It will be an interesting experiment .
- - Let s say a woman s baby just died and some guy constantly makes fun of the dead baby around her  where does this fit into your beliefs 
  - It s unfortunate  but it s that persons choice .
- - if you want a super cheap one you can go with that  but if you plan on future upgrades you better get a better mobo
  - Thanks for the advice  Quick question  what would define a better motherboard  How can I tell 
- - How is this bad luck  Waking up drunk is the best  You have plenty of time to hydrate and eat to stave off any possible hangovers .
  - Yeah thats true . You got a valid point there . Still  it limits me in the things I would have liked to do today  driving for instance .
- - Sounds like it has failed . Sorry to hear that  hopefully they will find out what went wrong and fix it free .
  - It looks like they will . I ll know for sure on Monday  but when I spoke to them earlier it sounds like it ll be all under warranty .
- - Do these stunts work well in chases 
  - Well  no . Sometimes you ll fall if you hit the curb  and sometimes it will work  but you ll die when you land the jump .
- - And it s really not easy being in the closet to your parents and still trying to check out guys while with them .
  - It s not easy being out to them and checking out guys while with them either .
- - Did nt really fancy snape  but this just made him a bigger hero than the book ever could . Well done .
  - The Epic of Gilgamesh could nt make him any more of a hero
- - Oh i hate people who rush through while the other two methodically work their way through . If the rusher dies the whole fireteam wipes .
  - That does nt make sense at all . Wipe  This is nt hard mode VOG .
- - Void s ult is completely counterable . Do nt bunch together and get a Eul s  Ta-da  Void ca nt hurt you anymore .
  - Just chrono on the counter heroes or eul carriers . done .
- - You should probably delete this comment before your idea gets stolen . It s actually pretty cool
  - At the same time I do nt really have the resources or capital to put an idea like this into motion
- - He s Amaterasu s primary sub . He s like the Haku to her Pandora .
  - No one speak of his usefulness to wukong
- - Are you on EU or NA server 
  - NA I live in the Midwest . Sorry should have said that .

  - wish i had a kebab right now . goddamn .
- - I feel like I m the only one who has nt had any issues with Yosemite . It has worked pretty flawlessly from day one for me ...
  - Mine was rock solid in the beta s too
- - That was so fucking shit  I m furious . We did nt deserve anything . Why is Gerrard playing  
  - Because Brendan has nt got the balls to keep him out of the team for more than one game .
- - And that is their decision to do so  nobody forced them to do it
  - And the other thing to add is that others buying keys or whatever has virtually no effect on your game .
- - You keep on saying that . But they re muslims and hence invaders . The Serbs have all the rights in the world to keep our turf free from them .
  - There is nt much Serbia can do short of a genocide  which I obviously do nt approve of .
  - They can force them to Asia . Push them back to turkey and the ones who wo nt go should be seen as enemy combatants and death with accordingly .
  - Like Turkey is going to take them . Turkey does nt want them .
- - Just because the salaries line up does nt mean it s even worth talking about . Jeff Green and Gerald Wallace for Kevin Durant  anyone 
  - Anything is worth talking about . The question is if anyone is willing to talk about it . And I guess your not .
- - This is nt even something to submit a report about  though . So maybe only the learn and move on  bits .
  - Yeah  true . But the guy was abusing trust  which in my book breaks rules .
- - You could always rotate it so that it was right side up ...
  - Does nt really work to wear a sweatshirt upside down . But next time I ll triple check before I apply heat .
- - Did you take damage from enemy in a while
  - Thanks for the clarity  I had no idea really
- - Yeah  the combo of high temperature  very low humidity  and moving air is not terribly healthy .
  - Err ... like any desert anywhere  Low humidity is what you want .
- - So funny to me how she panders to the most ignorant of liberals and they eat this shit up .
  - So I assume you can provide some details on the TPP then 
- - Are you getting a bad pop off the coil as it s heating up with the build that came on it  What wattage are you using 
  - That s probably an indication of not enough wick
- - It s an interesting idea at least . Really any other rapper would have been better to experiment with this .
  - well i mean  Yela already does it well .
- - I ca nt even tell if mine is or not .
  - I ca nt even tell if this sentence i m making right now is or is not 
- - I think you are missing the point of the poster . Its criticizing more than just straightforward bullying . Its criticizing cultural norms .
  - I am willing to admit that s possible . Thank you .
- - so are you a gator  just wanted to bump this .
  - No  I am not an alligator . I am a gladiator  however .
- - I do nt even notice anything wrong .
  - Well that s sweet to hear  Thanks .
- - I hope you did nt get blood on your camera .
  - I took the photo after it stopped bleeding .
- - I mean in this case let s call it the freedom to insult . Labeling it as freedom to speech is disingenuous .
  - Freedom of speech is all speech  not just speech that no one finds insulting .
- - Who makes a cannon at home and for what purpose 
  - Explosions are cool and here hold my beer .
- - You do nt have to be the best to be king . You just need a devoted horde of minions .
  - The post I replied to implied so .
- - Jameis is nt looking too hot right now . Passes seem to be all over the place and seems to be pretty flustered and wants to get out of the pocket
  - Agreed . He is VERY young but did not have a good showing today .
- - Look out ladies  the Groose is loose
  - There is a significant lack of him in Hyrule Warriors ...
- - Looks like there is a clock on your wallpaper
  - No  that is nt a screenshot but it does look like it .

  - That makes me feel terrible for the future of feminism if this is the best answer 
- - Wow no punt interference  the refs are trying to screw us .
  - Did you really just say the refs are screwing you guys ...
- - If he has a BS but says he has FT  he s scamming .

- - I wish they d sell keychains or something similar that looked like these . I d buy them in a heartbeat .
  - You and me both . I could do with a Grump head Wallet  Thanks for commenting 
- - Still  in game items should not be reaching this level of value .
  - It s a player based economy so blame the players for the high market value on items
- - How does salary cap work in MLS  Why does LA get all the big names besides the obvious desire to live in LA if you cross the pond
  - They sign them as Designated Players  only a small portion counts against the cap .
- - who is rooster teeth and why have I heard that name before
  - Red vs Blue and more recently RWBY . And stuff like Achievement Hunter and Rage Quit . They do good stuff .
- - LOL there are more comments being made in here than on the UG results
  - Amazing things can happen when websites function .

- - Now he s watching the game from his couch like the rest of us .
  - Hes just like me and AJ Green 
- - Where did you get that painting in your living room 
  - I got it from a friend of mind before he moved away to Ecuador . I think I remember him saying he got it at Ross I believe .
- - His private message to me is even sadder .
  - Oh boy  sounds like fun . Mind posting it 
- - DUUUUUDE this is actually fucking awesome . I was nt expecting much but holy shit  you have some serious potential .
  - Well thanks . You never know when somebody says they remixed a classic song . But I m glad you liked it .
- - I do nt remember exactly  but it s maybe something to do with the pressure change within the radiator as the water cools . I believe it can cause leaks .
  - More like explosions . Found this out my sophomore year when I came back from Spring break to a steamy  flooded dorm room .
- - We know  we live here  there are signs .
  - I do nt know  without that long URL linking to a single sentence from a website for a newspaper across the continent I might not have known .
- - Is English your second language  It s difficult to understand what point you re trying to make .
  - Resort to firing shots  whatever . I m not going to get lured into a tit for tat dissing match .
- - His post taught me that he is nt living in reality .
  - If you subscribe to TRP philosophy  it is automatically implied that you are nt living in reality .
- - Why do girls travel in odd numbers 
  - Blah blah ca nt even  heard it before  next please .
- - I lurk . I do not call or text out of respect for the other partner . I wait patiently for them to call it quits . Then it is on .
  - I dunno why I read that last sentence really creepy .
- - Omg reading the headline I thought this was about a baby  Do nt shake babies 
  - Why not  Shaking has calmed down every crying baby I ve met .
- - but this does nt explain the thousands of international Korean graduate students at the most prestigious universities in the West .
  - It does explain the lack of thousands of Western graduate students at the most prestigious universities in Korea  though .
- - I appreciate everyones opinion . But for me  swag over stats
  - i still rock the VoG Titan helm because its epic . The new Raid helm looks like you are cross-eyed .
- - It s a liquid though  the cum will go down the drain
  - Let s just say I have experience and from my experience if the holes are small it refuses to go down and you might need to get it with a tissue .

  - Yea  this and the small holes . Would not have gone down without a fight  Was a rather thick load as well .

  - I m just playing  it just sorta looked like him
- - The only thing drunk mathematicians understand is Common Core .
  - Not even drunk mathematicians can understand Common Core .
- - I d say it s more disgusting than it is hilarious
  - the whole comic continues in such a fashion too .
- - but would she attend the after party 
  - Only if she could bring her husband Jane along  I guess .

  - Yeah  he does the cleans on this one and Kill the Pain
- - Because your archer queen is on that side . Getting rid of the queen early on is important for quite a few strategies .
  - And that s side also lines up with the cc so they pull the enemies troops into the core
- - Does the guy in the back right have a riot shield 
  - Both flanks have guys with ballistic shields .

- - both games have pretty low ratings . are they worth it 
  - They are fun if you like trading SIMs . Or you can go pirate and attack people and take ships but you ca nt really win games that way .
- - But going by the numbers and not anecdotal evidence which group contains people with the least secular views on punishment and personal freedoms 
  - No idea . I m pretty sure it is nt the Americans and from what i have heard neither the British . Probably some one like Iceland .

  - Daaamn ... you might be right about this one .

- - If my first time watching hockey was this game I would nt be a hockey fan .
  - Then you d be a pretty stupid person
- - Sadly that s the stupidest way to try and win a hockey game .

  - Yeah  I see his story ending at the end of a rope .

  - If you are in the US  Walmart does large format poster prints same day .
- - We re not going to switch to a whole new defense even if TA leaves  you dont fix what s not broken .
  - If we list TA and do nt get any of our dline free agents re-signed it ll be an issue .
- - I think it s a bad hypothetical . It s not a good idea to encourage people to express their passionate hatred for others who never even harmed them .
  - Oh no  it s the thought police  Go find a real cause and devote yourself to it . This is a silly thread on an internet forum .
- - Can you trim it down to size  Maybe the beard will be the reason you get the job . Maybe the beard will lead you towards a better job .
  - No  I ca nt  most HR people have told me to be shaved in the interview  otherwise not to show up .
- - Good interior defense is nt IMPOSSIBLE to play
  - If we did nt have more points in the paint than they did  you might have something there .

  - I honestly think the Cowboys will manage to come away with this one ... which I hate .
- - I did nt know women were incapable of using guns and knives
  - They are capable of using guns and knives . And if anyone stared at me I would think that had them too .
- - but then both the xbal and Osiris skins are seasonal so surely they should be looking to make non-seasonal skins for them
  - I agree  they should . I still stand by what I said  however  since the Osiris skins are fairly new .
- - HI GUYS WATCHING THE HABS WO NT BE IN THIS GDT  GON NA BE WATCHING THE GAME WITH MY DAD
  - TRAITOR ... jk family time is important .
- - They should be able to fine players for that
  - Players should be able to say no to trades to tanking teams then  if they ca nt already .
  - um no this is a business and hes being paid millions of dollars to play
  - He is nt being paid because he doesnt want to play for a tanking team .
- - That s neat  but was it worth typing really  Changes nothing .
  - it s always annoyed me since I was a child . had to finally get this off my chest now that they finally released a venom .
- - cats eye here . Though I m not sure what it goes for these days . um

  - Unfortunately  there s no markings on it .
- - They re pre-steeped . Go for it .
  - Yup  you re good to go 
- - I still dont have snake trap  what would you replace it with  another freeze 
  - The snake trap kinda makes this deck go from ok to awesome in a pinch I d use a freeze .
- - Yeah i figured as much . They do need to upgrade speeder movement speed then
  - They re not going to do that either . The game engine is nt designed for it .
- - Someone make a compilation of every mistake in this game to benny hill
  - I wonder how many times you d have to loop the song 
- - Wait  they managed to escape after that  Holy shit
  - they shot the responding cops changed car and ran away before more police showed up
  - It dosent help when the responding police officer shows up on the scene with a bicycle .
  - He wasnt part of a counter terrorism unit or anything like that . He was just a normal cop responding to a call .
- - Companies like this have lawyers on retainer so they just have to send one
  - I mean it still costs them money 
- - Ugh was hoping NYCFC or New England Revolution . Sturridge must have told him how awesome LA was .
  - Anything but NYCFC  especially since they ve proven that they re nothing more than a glorified farm team to help Man City get around financial fair play rules .
- - Of all people  it s Quincey .
  - He s been playing good man . But yeah  he does nt usually score
- - no stop it i keep getting excited each time i see orangered and it turns out to be YOU
  - last post wins . i do nt sleep . see you in hell .
- - If you want to get rid of them  with that method you would then want to drown them . Its cruel but its a sure way they are gone .
  - That s kinda a cruel way to kill them . Breaking their necks sends more reasonable to me .
- - As a Panthers fan  it sure as hell aint Don and Mike Shula .
  - It s not Don and Dave Shula either .
- - Rebooting seems to fix the Android OS battery drain for me
  - I ve tried rebooting and even a factory reset with no success D .
- - Ignoring the Giants  Yankees  Dodgers  Orioles  Pirates  Cardinals .
  - As a Dodger fan I hate to admit that those Giants jerseys are sexy . Great looking caps too .
- - Admittedly  I forgot about Dallas  and them against the Lions is an almost sure thing  but whether they can beat Seahawks is not certain .
  - Well Dallas did beat the Seahawks in regular season
  - Yeah  but there s a difference between Regular Season Dallas vs Regular Season Seahawks and Postseason Dallas vs Postseason Seahawks .
  - Yeah  like Bobby Wagner being healthy . When he came back their defense started rolling .
  - I was thinking of Tony Choko Romo .
  - This all may be true  but I have faith in the Cowboys . They are a different team this year .
- - Quadruple option ... Nah  that might work ; Yurcich would never run it .
  - Yurcich needs to be beaten with a pipe .
- - No they are not lol ... they charge your card bro ... it s like telling me the Gas station is fronting me money when my AMEX clears at the pump .
  - They have your credit card on file as a backup but you could easily cancel your card and get a new one and they probably would nt realize it .
- - Why does nt Kessel ask for a trade 
  - He should . I feel like getting rid of the toronto media would be a huge weight off his shoulders and he ll perform better . He hates the spotlight .
- - It was but they unlocked it for everyone if you linked your account to the halo app if I remember correctly .
  - Well hello there  this is quite an old thread to stumble upon . P I do believe you are right .
- - Think you messed up your link . Leads to nothing .
  - Well  edited in my trade link since im on my pc now
- - Did we consider that Elon s tweet said that the AMA is supposed to be focused on tomorrow s launch 
  - No . Maybe he watched this sub and saw the questions and decided to clarify .
- - I hear the only thing China is doing with it is looking for a cat or some type of animal
  - Both humans and cats have identical regions in the brain responsible for emotion .
- - I ve always considered shows like the Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire to be the creme de la creme  but Hannibal has really taken things to a whole new level .
  - Possibly the best way to describe someone on the brink of watching it
- - I d like to believe many of the dwarves are women  but from the reader s perspectives  they are referred to as male because of their big bushy beards .
  - They do like their women especially beardy .
- - Penelope is adorable . Rats are remarkably calm and curious animals .
  - they are awesome  i dint like this one at first but then i ended up buying a second one for my girlfriend so this one would have a friend
- - I mean  he d look exactly like me . Is ... is that not enough 
  - Well ... it is the future . For all you know it could be a clone or evil robot .
- - Pretty sure I could give up all my electronics for a few days there . Looks amazing 
  - Absolutely beautiful  I d highly recommend it . Frozen drinks  relaxing on a beach with my beautiful wife  and not an email beep for miles .
- - The delegation from Arcturus would be willing to travel alongside Chief Karenac and any others he may wish to bring with him in our boats to this feast .
  - This would be accepted by Chief Karenac  and he thanks Arcturus for this hospitable offer . He and eight companions sail with you .

- - Goddamnit . Forgot about Luck s legs .
  - So did the rest of the team apparently .
- - What are you going to write about  do you know yet  Why do nt you do the simple part now

- - Do you happen also to be a bear 
  - Yes and i have a lot of hair .
- - Can we just give Tucker the same contract we gave Flacco 
  - i Would nt be surprised if we give Tucker the biggest kicker contract in history considering he s statistically the best kicker ever
- - Now you are just trying too hard . Get some rest . Good evening .
  - Trying too hard is my middle name .
- - I liked it because I was in it .
  - Upvoted because I just followed you the whole battle . Excellent job fc 
- - Dick is somewhat dead ... Good times .
  - The things we do to our bodies to look good . I hope everything gets ... umm ... fixed   lol
- - I think that you get a skin for the champion you played most recently i got tpa shen and i got shen yesterday but then again it may just be random
  - nope got hextech janna when i played ahri . and on my smurf i got an akali skin when i last played ahri .
- - Why do nt they give Panger a stool 
  - Cus everyone loves how short he looks next to our players .
- - Not the fans . But definitely the media . Harbaugh
  - lol  what  How did the media drive him out of town  They just reported on the friction between him and the FO .
- - Yes  it is . I ve played many games that were definitely more fun after I used cheat codes .
  - You just reminded me of Quake . Man that was so much better in God mode .
- - People who refuse to take ownership of a problem . Not just in business  in your personal life too . Responsibility dodging excuses making ass muthafuckas .
  - Also  people who always have to find someone to place the blame on .
- - What the fuck is happening . Is the score the right way round 
  - I m convinced I ve woken up in a parallel universe .
- - Have you posted that signature as proof  That s pretty solid evidence right there .
  - I had not  I have now .
- - Could wanting to stop treatment on a very treatable form of cancer be considered a suicidal action 
  - So Steve Jobs committed suicide by that logic
  - I am fine with saying that . He did .
  - He was a bit whacked  even for a billionaire .
- - All I could think the whole time was UTI incoming .
  - Right  Not a hint of apprehension there . How she is not gagging is beyond me .
- - What s with trans girls posting boy mode  pictures where they look more like a girl than I ever did 
  - I appreciate that . I m having a rough night  and this is definitely making me feel a bit better .
- - Great . TB did nt mention anything about sexism . The term that idiot Macintosh used was toxic masculinity . This is about violence .
  - That s fair  but that was nt your question . You were asking how a difficulty setting can be sexist . edit . grammar
- - Maybe if Michigan did nt ban the sale of Teslas ...
  - Michigan did nt ban the sale of Teslas  all they have to do is setup a dealership network and sell away .
- - And ... BatteryLife was just updated to include this exact function ... Strange timing ... O.O
  - oooo  I did nt expect that  what a bad time

  - did you get everything you asked for  tell me what you did not get .
- - Give it up Australia . I saw the Starbucks cheese flavoring . Cuteness is not saving you .
  - As far as I know we do nt even have starbucks in Australia .
- - This has been added in the second beta 
  - Yup so excited . Now  Hangul support would be nice  but I do nt really care about that . That s more for my dad than me .
- - steve kerr inherited a stacked team . I feel like Casey or Bud are the front runners for COTY right now unless if SVG gets the pistons to the playoffs and beyond
  - A lot of coaches might have ruined what Golden State had created tho . He found a way to make them improve
- - Not too many fsu fans hanging around anymore
  - Well yeah . Everyone posting is being super obnoxious about us losing  and it s not fun to post in here .
- - I m not sure if Mauk s going to make it home from Florida
  - Seriously ... he looks bad ... Should nt someone call his family

  - Oh yes  I do see you over there  But why are they paying you with ones  And why are they putting them in your shorts 
- - Does this mean I ca nt make my own map 
  - i assume you still can as long as it does nt have any scripts
- - I think it would be pretty easy to prove you feared for your life if a mob of SJW was attacking you .
  - Not really  their mobility scooters are nt exactly that fast .
- - Yes it does . You need to adjust your stick movement to account for whichever way your player is facing .
  - ugh thats gon na take some practice lol . Thanks 
- - Kendrick . uh ... well ... he ... he s short  I guess 
  - He makes everyone else look bad . What a dick .
