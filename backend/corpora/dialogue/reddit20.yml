- - Then you should nt own a cat . Let someone who has more respect for life look after it .
  - Just like I want my family to pull the plug on me if my future medical bills will put them in financial ruin .
- - I described the curve of my penis is great detail
  - Tell me more  tell more me  does it bend very far 
- - How do these compare to the playstation gold headsets

- - Ca nt use his moms credit card ...
  - I ve used his moms credit card  do nt see why he cant
  - Oh great and I get down voted for setting up the alley oop   LOL
  - Bahahaha that s rough . Upvotes for you
- - TIL ; people disagree with eachother on the internet and make TIL posts to call eachother out
  - They also use this sub as a place to reword and then push personal agendas under the guise of TIL material .
- - grrr the way they talk over her ... I d not sit there and take .
  - Agreed . They seriously need to learn some basic respect for others . Especially Trump .
- - I ll take two  please . That is the fully grown size  is nt it  Excellent . How much is shipping 
  - I think it s a cub actually .
  - No No I am pretty sure thats the full size of that thing .
  - Really  I may be wrong then . It s just so cute I could nt believe this little face was fully grown
- - I did nt know this thread existed .
  - The other thread went right over your head .
- - I have many tabs - look at the full list  one . That is what I created from your template .
  - Ah i was almost asleep when I looked at it . Going to work now .
- - Why did nt you call your finance company when he made that statement   
  - Because at the time it made sense . I was not aware that the finance company was not allowed to do that  so i didnt question it .
- - Uuugh so jealous . I m sitting here in my cubicle drooling over every bit of that .
  - Oh I m sorry  This is my last day of vacation so believe me  I feel your pain . Back to my cube Monday . Enjoy your day 
- - If you re anywhere near anything that gets hit with a depleted uranium shell you probably are nt standing around afterwards .
  - This has nothing to do with my point . The after effects of DU is far worse as it persists .
- - Starring a cat as Momo and a bat as glider 
  - Oh so that s what the bat is for 
- - I hated when random people touched your belly without asking . Complete strangers would touch my stomach and it drove me nuts

  - I would nt be laughing  I d be worried that my existence represented a danger to the narrative .
- - Yeah  I d rather have McNabb than Schultz right now . Our passing is still a little off  we need to be more accurate with those .
  - Absolutely . The Preds are good on turnovers .
- - It s the sole reason it was up for trade . Guess only the lucky few can use this pokemon .
  - It was up for trade because of the RNG 
- - Sweet  By the way  I may be wrong  but I think building settlers is faster with a food focus  not production focus . Anyways  nice album .
  - Do nt settlers cost production  not food 
- - Belichick . How is this even a question 
  - How could Belicheck be anyone other than Rasputin 
- - Some schools may discipline for selling stuff in this manner though .
  - Yeah  at my school he did nt really get in trouble but they told him to knock it off and threatened him with detention if he sold any more .
  - Well  it is not legal to sell food without a license to do so . The school kinda has to do something about it if they re aware .
  - Its not so much that  but that the school gets money from the vending companies and probably agreed that there would be no competition . And the distraction factor .
- - Sounds like pretty obvious sarcasm  no 
  - And even so  if it was nt it would just be an oversight by a writer . No reason to immediately distrust pcgamer because they made a mistake
- - The world hates us ... thats fine  we go in there and proved to the world that records do nt matter . Cam and Luke leads us to the promise land
  - I ll take Wilson and Wagner over Cam and Luke any day .

  - A thing to remember is spreading Mdf makes it fuzz  so it s gon na be spray  then sand  repeat a couple times .

  - That and UV radiation  what a tan .

  - Down votes  Ha ha  ca nt handle the true  eh 
- - Yeah against Ottawa  so it does nt really count .
  - Have you seen us play  We are nt any better . A win is a win .
  - I know  but a win against us at this point is like taking candy from a baby . P
  - Still a baby taking candy from a baby .
- - yea  that is clearly not long enough
  - I know I watch weeks of porn every day 
  - Why does nt every have ten separate porn videos open on their screen constantly  How else am I supposed to get my weeks of porn watched 
  - I just watch it fast forward . Makes me feel better about my premature ejaculation .
- - Jealous . I had a remote starter in my last car  would kill for it in this one . Or underground parking .
  - You can get them installed ... Ya know ... Without murder . Just money .
- - I have nt actually played the game but I ve heard good things about Heroes of Ruin . There s a demo in the eshop I believe .
  - Looking into this one  it might be exactly what I wanted . I m going to try out the demo  thanks for the suggestion .
- - Read all the comments about the comic on the TFP website . I dare you .

  - Someone s salty about their Delver matchup lol .
- - I do nt hate the call to look for a pass  but if he s not wide open you should take the sack there .
  - Yes  just roll out and get as close to the LOS as you can and slide .
- - Do you have a video for this  This does nt sound right at all .
  - Downvoted for asking for video proof  That does nt make sense . I have a keeper with fade cloak . I ll test this later this evening .
- - Should probably also look at the minorities treatment of police officers as well . Parallel effort .
  - Waaah  WHAT ABOUT COPS NOT GETTING THEIR RESPECT  lol
- - fucking religion  what good is this - none fuck war fuck oppression
  - Ive had nightmares of this happening where I live ... and I fear shootings are going to become more frequent  what are we going to do about it 
- - I think you re thinking of Markovic

- - This man has won actual  real awards for his writing .
  - I give you an actual real award for this comment  GREAT COMMENT AWARD

  - Where were you  Summer of Love 
- - Would nt universal healthcare take care of the mandatory requirement of auto insurance 
  - What about the cost of the vehicle if it is totaled 
- - This is true  if Security sees you sleeping in a building  they will kick you out . Some sort of liability issue I expect .
  - Yes  it makes sense that they would nt want anyone sleeping overnight as you could get random people off the street sleeping on campus overnight .
- - Would nt categorize them as stoner rock  but I love Wavves .
  - I would just because of of the notion that they sell custom grinders and rolling papers .
  - Snoop Dogg sells grinders  papers  G pens  socks and tshirts with huge pot leaves of them . I would nt consider him stoner rock though .
  - That s because he s a rapper . Wavves is a rock band heavily influenced by weed  so why not classify them as stoner rock 
- - why are you wasting frames on jump squat 
  - Could you elaborate on that  I m not quite sure what you mean .
- - A real sarcasm detector . Make it an app that can also scan texts and emails .
  - Ca nt tell if you re being sarcastic or not .

- - How can i find out if they are going to open the dome or not 
  - It will be closed . Why would they try to freeze out a team when they could be comfortable 
- - Much more realistic than I would expect from that era and region .
  - Roman empire had hella great artists all over though 
- - He s too out of meta to matter .
  - He s also very effective in low elo where most people here are so that s important to note .
  - I have nt seen an amumu in months .
  - His solo queue winrate is still solid . He s not especially popular  but that does nt mean he s not a decent pick . He s just not fotm .
- - Is nt she staring bemused at Bolin signing autographs   For that matter  Borra evidence .
  - possibly . I figured Bolin had already finished by then though either way  her expression and the way she just stood there just creeped me out during my rewatch
- - In my head  that is known as the Le Tissier Street Fighter goal .
  - Without watching the video  I know exactly what goal you re taking about
- - Destroys environment . Destroys economy . Calls us screw ups .
  - Lol come on now that s ridiculous . The environment has been being screwed hard for a long time now .
- - I d become a flying license plate with lasers for eyes .
  - But your weakness is that license plates do nt have eyes .

  - How much did that set you back 
- - My dad texted me last night to ask if I was okay to be here with the cold like I do nt own a heater or something .
  - Tell him you just set the carpet on fire to stay warm .
- - They are nt your friends . I m serious .
  - I feel like you re assuming an awful lot about people you do nt actually know .
- - So correct me if I m wrong but EEG machines worth their salt are worth in the tens of thousands ... how accurate is this thing 
  - I do nt know yet . Not as accurate as a medical EEG though .
- - OHHHHHHHH ... What a bunch of fucking hypocrites then . This incarnation needs to be banned as well .

  - Nah he was an important character it d be distracting .
- - Sunwalker makes sense but Belcher wont get nerfed .

  - No dice  I do nt use stoves  they re the devil . Now if you have some Easy Mac ...
- - Okay so time to root for the Panthers now  Please oh please be the better Carolina team today .
  - Lol ... maybe this game . Maybe .
- - I think we should trade way down and try and get more picks to shore up the ol .
  - So you want to add more rookies to our extremely inexperienced o-line 
- - Why are people sucking the pee thingy 
  - Or better yet  why are people licking the poop thingy 
- - What he is saying is that when people get their ssds  they just reboot the pc over and over  in awe of the speeds .
  - Yup this is what I meant . I ve seen this happen and for the first hour maybe I was doing the same .
- - I can not get over the fact that Impact and Rush are on the same team as Wizfujin . I just ca nt .

- - Hey there  I can hatch for these next hours .
  - Hi . I ve added your FC .

  - He got passed up by Barrett a couple days before Miller went down .
- - Dayum ... What sphere was on him before glitch 
  - I think it was the Sacred Snowglobe . That or a Sacred Jewel .

- - do you think i should mess with the volume or rather concentrate on the rest of the mix instead of this detail 
  - Personally I d work around the vocals setbacks . Make it part of your remix .
- - Christians did nt go murder a bunch of people because of said art . Muslims went out and murdered a bunch of people because of a cartoon .
  - If you re saying Christians are less violent than Muslims  you re fighting a losing battle
- - I make my guy bald and make his clothes black I m not bald
  - I sometimes like making my character skin white  red eyes  bald  and full black clothes . Looks kinda weird though .

  - Awesome  I use the royal bank plaza location . They have everything there 
- - Everytime I see this video comes up it makes me miss Hleb more and more ...
  - I know man  After he left his career only went downhill which is sad too .
- - It s like a visual presentation of a migraine .
  - Except I was nt in the fetal position in a dark room . Not yet  at least .
- - And resisting the urge to IM them for an appropriate amount of time after they signed on
  - Then sometimes waiting too long and just when you thought of something witty to say .
- - Game is too hard . Please make AA more like WoW .

  - You are barking up the wrong tree .
- - Nicely done  wich champ was the weakest 
  - Thank you  Obviously the meta champs are in reality the weakest but no one knows it and they keep playing them 
- - I always assumed drinking every wipe was part of the raid mechanics ... just me 
  - that would have been a painful drinking game last night 
- - Good idea and thanks for the positive feedback 
  - You re welcome . Keep it up 
- - Are nt auto clickers allowed  They re not injecting into the game code after all .
  - Of course they are nt allowed . Any macro use is against the code of conduct .
- - Wait wait  the Kennedy s forced them to integrate and now their stadium is RFK  That s pretty funny 
  - FedEx Field . Nobody honors history anymore  only which corporation shells out the most cash .
- - Thank you  Now people need to read this 
  - I just hope it helps some people and their cats . I hope more people see this and pass it on
- - everybody bitching about the PI and casually ignoring when the lions squealed by a roughing the punter penalty
  - First half penalties were all going against us . We cleaned up our play  they didnt .
- - Does it have a shattered wing mirror 
  - Those are just reflections from a tree and the sky .
- - CT scanners are fascinating but work differently from MRI . MRI does nt use ionizing radiation .
  - That s why I did nt call it an MRI . I just posted that because it s cool .
- - I guess this puts to rest the unstoppable force vs. the immovable object .
  - You ca nt really say that truck is an unstoppable force  notice how it was easily stopped 
- - We apologize for the tragedy that occurred . We hope to investigate into the death and continue working together for Africa . Do nt let this divide 
  - Which tragedy  I am sorry for my cluelessness  but  what has happened 
  - WADA hired a sniper to shoot our leader after inviting us to peaceful talks . As we have said earlier - think carefully of who you are willing to trust .
  - You have no proof I did it . Bring me substantial evidence that proves I did it and we will see who walks free .
- - This has always been my favorite Christmas song  and this is now my favorite rendition . Thank you so much  Angel . Your voice is very moving .
  - Thank you so much  I m happy to hear you enjoyed it 
- - Customer s should say no and go someplace else . That way bad companies can go out of business like they should .

- - There s this great new thing that makes you not so butthurt as to be a sarcastic fuck to people on the internet  a vagina 
  - Wait  you ve mixed your orifices . Which one did you want to insult me with

  - I would LOVE Urban Meyer . Not sure he wants to leave college  though .
- - Not being negative  but we still ca nt create clear cut chances . Midfield seems non existent .
  - Midfield is being bypassed with poor distribution from the back . Plus we spending some time in our own half under pressure .
- - Sister got into car accident just after first period and I just got back ... WTF HAPPENED ...
  - Car accident in Vancouver  So ... business as usual 
- - Im not sure taking on that responsibilty was ever a question . The problem is being lied to  and then becoming an ATM to someone elses child .
  - Agreed but if you love the kids and it s informed consent  I do nt see it as an issue .
- - The toe on the right of my big toe is longer than the others  and on the other foot it s normal .
  - I do nt think that s uncommon . Unless we re talking about your left foot .

  - I do nt see you denying anything that I said about the Republican party yet you defend them . I should think that you re really looking for a genuine argument 
- - Just as a word of advice  I d also avoid Hyrule Warriors  seeing as it has the same style of combat .
  - They are nt really the same type of combat . At all  just because you can button mash at lower difficulties does nt mean they are the same .
- - I think you ve confused your argument . You say you reject nationalism but then think it s a crime against Muslims in general to attack a sovereign nation .
  - when i say iraq i mean the region not the state
- - I m down for a Grump orgy . EDIT . Also  Markiplier would have to come along because holy shit that man is beautiful .

- - Well we d be more like England due to the monarchy which is much more fun to role play . I m up for either 
  - It would be America cuz America and the Soviet Union are huge rivals but I m not saying we have to be just like America it s just a comparison
- - What if this was re-posted on an infinite loop until the end of time

  - That s certainly true  I just needed an excuse to post that thing because I love it lol
- - Why did the refs not mention the MSU players were nt ready 
  - Clearly they did nt want to be in this game  they feel they deserve the playoff
- - A cat s penis has tiny barbs on it . You re welcome .
  - Is there any part of a cat that is nt covered in tiny barbs 
- - Warmer stuff has more taste . Cold decreases the flavor of everything .
  - Is this science  I had no idea ...
- - Wikipedia is apparently the spawn of satan .
  - To get around that go to the bottom it has all the articles that were cited for Wikipedia . A lot of those are peer reviewed and passable in college papers .
- - The main site is currently undergoing a redesign that will update the site visually and add a nice download page .
  - Great to hear . Looking forward to the update .
- - I am going to my first Pats game on Saturday with my mom . See you there

  - We need guys like him . I love passionate view points
- - Seems like they re a little touchy .
  - A little haha ... they were chomping the entire game even when they were down two touchdowns lol ...
- - Depends . Do you love him or is it a contract marriage 
  - Seems like they enlisted together for the bonus .
- - They re gon na fucking call it off I ca nt fucking BELIEVE it . No wait  yes I can 
  - I m really worried you might be right .
- - I m not in the US . I m in the Middle East . And I do nt need therapy . I need real help .
  - But what kind of help  How can we help you when you wo nt say what you need 
- - I d say the cold is only a rich asshole deterrent . All the people that ca nt afford to leave are still here and are still assholes

  - Got the jock and socks . Helmet is in picture . Just hard to see .

  - Yup . You do nt really know a person if you think that they are nt in any way fucked up .
- - And so the right wing closes in to get votes .
  - They should if the left wing is so incapable that they just pretend that it did nt happen . Both sides exist for a reason .
- - I agree i m just saying he played a lot better than his stats 
  - Absolutely . Got robbed more than a few times .
- - Every time I see Romo fumble that snap my heart is warmed .
  - They should show him throwing a TD to John Phillips against the Eagles .
- - Yeah that outlier has a name . It s Steve Nash
  - Amare did do well with DAntoni s tenure with the Knicks but Nash with the ball in his hands gets everyone a good contract .
- - Agreed . If nobody else in your office wears one  wearing one will simply make people think you re just trying to make a fashion statement .
  - Because it could nt POSSIBLY be that you simply like them  oh no ... it would HAVE to be about making a statement . Mhm .
  - Eh  they could easily be interpreted as a tryhard move in a conservative environment .
  - Conservative types are nt the best people to truly respect the opinions of  though . As they re often really  really blinkered .
- - Stick it to the man . Hilarious  fun  great style . I have nt seen a single word written on it all year .

- - What shithole of the world is this pic from 
  - While this is nt a definitive answer it s certainly another shithole full of AKs and religious bullshit where bullets are cheaper than clean water .
- - Considering the smashing success that was the America s Cup  I doubt there s any public land left for the IOC to steal ...
  - The stadium would have been built in Oakland .
- - I just asked a simple question . If you can answer it I d appreciate it . If not  then I m off .
  - Yeah and we told you how to say it correctly yet you re still pushing this occupied nonsense and get all snarky with people because you were mistaken .
- - The photos from the next season s cast for one .
  - how do they tell us all bets are off

- - Got ta love the effort Ceretropic puts into quality control . If only this happened with more vendors .
  - I want to get the best products out there . These new glass spray bottles are very nice 
  - I m looking forward to these . The latest batch is a lot better than the last but still s bit finicky .
  - Yeah  they give a better spray  and do nt leak . However  they are not nearly as good as the glass ones .
- - PC and Smash  we would get along nicely .
  - Haha two best things in life if you ask me 
- - If we got incorporated to it I think we d join the republic or stay neutral  it d be interesting to see what happens to the world s political systems .
  - I d like to think we would go republic  but we d probably go for the sound and secure first galactic empire
- - Oh  I completely misread it . I thought that sexual innuendo was on the lighter 
  - That would be even weirder  haha .
- - Every time I get catcalled . It also coincidentally makes me scared and walk faster .
  - Ok  well what was the best compliment you got paid 
- - How am i not supposed to dislike someone who wants us dead 
  - Because racism is literally worse than death .
- - Fucking retards . Especially the race traitors .
  - Especially that cameraman . I could nt tell exactly what was happening  but did he freak out just because he got slowly pushed out of the building 
- - Haha wow this is actually really good to know . Thanks for explaining and I like it that you still printed that issue haha
  - Hell if you re not occasionally pissing people off  you re not doing your job right 
- - Living in the midwest I get no problems from anyone when I say I do nt believe in god  but communities that are more religious might be different .
  - I d give both of my balls to be you .
- - Can you find the safe eggs in stores  or do I have to order online  I ve never seen them before .
  - Yep  I get mine from my local Whole Foods . I ve never ordered them online . You might be able to though .
- - just updated the list . forgot to finish it . I liked that for a while  but I need something smoother
  - I could see that  as the mod really does deviate from the way vanilla rocks look .
- - you werent forced out  you walked at the first confrontation
  - That s a bingo . No sympathy .
- - That s how I feel too . The ends never justify the means  but if my means are good  then I am prepared to accept any end .
  - that s not really what the duck meant
- - where do I use barb king  just use it as a faster clear  in case of a slow fight 
  - Use it to clean up at the end . Honestly  with only one air defense left it wo nt matter where you put your king .
- - Plot twist . she s in space .
  - I really hope so . Then I can say I almost dated a female astronaut .
- - In his mind you are basically his butler . Why would he care what you have to say 
  - Actually it s a tad more dickish ... apparently they think we are just giant dumb cats . They honestly look down on us .
- - I wonder if I should try this one day ...
  - You should probably try brushing at least twice a day .
- - There is no movement disabling item in the game . There is one that slows people  but that s it .
  - I m guessing he s talking about the CC cripple .
- - My ping has gone up on all servers .
  - Not all servers have changed - so that s likely on your end .
- - Might as well just put that in permanent chastity  because I really ca nt see a point to using the thing .
  - agreed . completely pointless  it d be a waste of time trying to make it cum .
- - I m interested in naked basics if you could swap or partial swap  I could give you BNIB A La Mode for it 
  - I m sorry I m not interested in swapping at this time . Thank you for the offer though .
- - All good bro . Nothing but fellow bald love here . I shave with a Panasonic electric razor . Screw getting blade cuts in my dome 
  - Dude  My cousin razor shaved my head once . The blood drops were so red . It didnt work for me though
- - Best thing to do as a beginner is to ignore many of the players which are complaining about you . Just have fun .
  - Yes . I ve noticed this . I think I m just going to have to play muted for a while until I get used to it .
- - And you re officially an idiot . Good for you .
  - Your invective notwithstanding do you have an argument in support of your position 
- - aww it s a custom  i went to ebay to possibly buy one and now im disappointed lol
  - No  it s not modified at all . Search lime hubs with either bmw or miata
- - Thanks for the feedback  I appreciate it . I ll check out you track when I get home to my computer in a little while .
  - For sure man I would appreciate that .
- - If they are back in training that means we can use them tomorrow right 
  - In theory  but does nt necessarily mean they re match fit .
- - Hey  I d love to get involved in something like this . I m based in Berlin  Germany .
  - Welcome  What is one of your easy favorite dishes  I ve always been curious about German food .
- - Whether it s leased or assigned  Nintendo have a pretty weak argument in the face of Infinity and Skylanders .
  - Skylanders does nt have to worry about the idea of selling out of all of their stock in two months though . That s the main difference .
- - do it . i am waiting on you guys having them to order mine  knowing that i have a pre-order in would be nice
  - Sounds good . I ll work on getting the pre-order up Tuesday or Wednesday .
- - u said golden dagger in the title thats very misleading  u could ve just said rusty dagger lmao .
  - and btw  rust goes below market at times ... so im not sure why ur going above .
- - Bad people can do heroic deeds . No one is saying this deed makes their previous wrongs  right .
  - Quite true  However please note that i am not saying the action was not heroic . I am saying they are not heroes .
- - So I thought about what you said and talked to him . Edited post .
  - Yayy  so did nt lose a bro or anything 
- - Wow . That is way more crazy than I expected . I seriously hope she gets some help .
  - After reading that article  how likely does that seem 
- - You know  you could have used all those marks to buy a legendary weapon . Or rank up a faction enough and you ll get one as well
  - I do nt play enough to get those kind of marks and the new commendations do nt make it any easier .
- - I M ALRIGHT . HOW ARE YOU 
  - I M ALRIGHT . MY MOUTH HURTS A LITTLE THOUGH . WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT 
- - Pretty cool  but I d also like a way to change the date format  also Nintendo is spelled wrong in the copyright area .
  - Damnit I suck at spelling . Fixed  Thanks .
- - No one gives a shit about the mountains .
  - I bet Mariota could throw over those mountains .
- - is better at gathering information and would be able to take . may be more aggressive  but that s their weakness .
  - Your username is what is coming out of my butthole . It burns .
- - Driving is a privilege and not a right .

  - Thanks  think I did well for coming up with them five minutes from reading the topic
- - This gives me slight hope but I ve been waiting about a year now
  - What  Stop it . If I was nt so dense or the thought crossed my mind I would have just asked her out .
  - Maybe I m reading him wrong and the thought has nt crossed his mind .
  - Or he s just afraid . Ask him yourself
- - Nah  Nintendo would never release one of their most asked for remakes on the eShop .
  - Thats why OOT is not in the eshop right  Oh wait ...
- - dang  I ca nt imagine what they say about their Android reviews .
  - Android reviews are not personal attack nor insults .
- - Wow  You re doing a horrible job at not being a lawyer .
  - Well I do nt see a gif of Patrick Swayze sexing a lady only to have her smash pottery into a clump of clay in your post .
- - What is the appeal of Star Wars  I ve tried to watch it but I ca nt get into it .
  - Well  do you dislike Sci-Fi and Fantasy in general 
- - Interested in leasing it for spring turkey season  pending a scouting walkthrough 
  - That wo nt work . Sorry . It s a retired lady who wants to sell and move in with her daughter .
- - The force should work on him  I doubt he could do it
  - The force would work on him . It just would nt be very effective with his level of durability .
- - Are you guys still accepting teams  I must have missed the signup post .
  - Yes  a new sign up sheet will be available soon . New signups will start in Sunday League automatically .
- - Yeah  my comment was honest bit harsh - I forget the ridiculous price of glasses
  - Nah  not harsh at all . Just a confirmation of something I d thought of a couple weeks ago  actually .
- - how does it feel having the keys on a straight line 
  - It s a bit strange  but I m sure I ll get used to it  I find the bottom Alpha row the most confusing .
- - If the offensive line gives Jones time  Ohio State wins .
  - Definetly . Passing looks the way to go . Potential for huge plays . Living dangerously .
- - Well here s hoping Bowman will actually do one
  - That seems like the right thing to do .
- - I used it a couple of times to dispel haste runes . pretty sweet  noone expects it .
  - And double damage would work too if need be . That makes sense
- - I at least hope to see a cameo by a vegetable platter that no one touches .
  - Say you love me so I know it s real
- - Oh my fucking god  Pereira is in the fucking booth . Why  
  - Just incase the Romo narrative does nt drive you mad
- - Could be used as a baton I m guessing
  - Yeah but we d at least know who the culprits are .
- - I have a Sheltie as well . They re one of the sweetest  most caring dogs I ve been around .
  - Truth  They would make excellent therapy dogs .
- - I just meant replace it with a clean one .
  - ah lol that makes sense  we replace em after every use
- - I thought he was just deleting his facebook page .
  - That s just a cry for attention .
- - that s all that matters  right 
  - right  they cant all be winners .
- - You are euphoric  for at this moment you know your self-righteousness is fueled not by any silly god  but your own enlightened intelligence .
  - I am just a comet in disguise .
- - In the US  DC . Happy new year 
  - Oh I see . Happy new year to you as well

- - I would ve traded you mac for falcon and pit
  - I found a fox for captain . thanks  Pit is still available if anyone needs .
- - Which part of the US are you from  I can send you popular Japanese and KOrean snacks 
  - We re in the northeast . That would be great  Never had Korean snacks before .
