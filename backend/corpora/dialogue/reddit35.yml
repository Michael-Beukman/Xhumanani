- - Which really is nt a big deal  in my opinion . Just cut ties and move on . Dragging it out like this is the bad part .
  - Agreed . Hopefully the NY FO steps up . I think the only way to properly handle this is for Kreis or Reyna to say THEY are reviewing Lampard s contract .
- - Edward Stark - I do what I got ta do even if it s unpleasant and I m loyal to the bone
  - Thats Eddard Stark . All the names in the ASOIAF are just a little bit irregular .

- - That is amazing . Only thinking about it now do I realize how sas a horse s neigh sounds and how a turkey sounds like a small  slime blob monster .
  - It really makes you think does nt it

  - But somehow they find the will to complain
- - These are pretty bold claims with nothing to back it up .
  - Yes  because the OP cited tons of sources in his own discussion  right  Right 
- - Well  I hope your computer perks up when it plays that song  . D
  - Well  it has nt helped the computer  but it certainly has perked me up 
- - Nope . Spend billions on space travel meanwhile people have crappy medical care in the US  lots of poor and homeless . It is out and out stupid

  - It was posing . If he had actually been hit by that train he would not still be all put together .
- - Oshie or berglund  blues need cap space for tarasenko and Schwartz . Although they may keep them for the playoffs .
  - Oshie  Really  How have I not heard about this .

  - The blues wanted Lucic or Dougie Hamilton for oshie and there was no way to make that deal . They passed .
  - That was a rumor . Loui Erikson and Marchand were also rumored to be possible candidates for trade .

  - I got my finishing grinder for free and it has been great 
- - what kind of instruments do you guys play

  - Too bad immigration to Switzerland is pretty difficult .

  - I agree  also want to point out that  despite it s flaws  Yarmouth Road has the redeeming quality of best music video of all time .

  - I think the problem with more Canadian teams are the only real viable untapped markets right now are Quebec City and southern Ontario . That and the dipping Loonie .
