  - RA LE is amazing imo . You ended up with quite a nice selection 
- - Will Paul Rudd promote Ant Man on Conan and them do this again ... I sure hope so .
  - It will happen . Rudd has been doing it for years . I do nt see that changing .
- - Plot twist . the husband is hoping his obeast wife eats herself to death and does nt want anyone to convince her to change .
  - And has a fit shitlady on the side
- - How do you propose that the hostages be freed then  Placate the terrorists with baguettes 
  - Well  we do have a lot of those .

  - Yes . Why is an elephant big  gray  and bumpy  If it was smooth  white  and round it would be an aspirin .
  - Out of every joke in this thread  this one made me laugh the most
  - Thanks  this is a slightly changed joke from a Highlights issue I read when I was a kid .
- - I ve wanted a set of those but I think they would look funny with how white my Mazda is .
  - Is it a sedan or hatch  Personally I think they would look good on a white hatchback .
- - If they hire on merit and skill  I do nt mind . If they re going by name recognition  we got a problem .
  - Merit is a weapon of the PATRIARCHY 
- - It wo nt help your score . The original creditor still did nt get paid . It will show as paid if somebody is reviewing your report in detail .
  - So I should negotiate a deletion upon payment or not pay at all

  - You re right . I forgot that the unsportsmanlike call would have been after the play .

  - Budweiser stocks his cabin for free  may has like a week s worth of calories in beer on stock .
- - This is one of those things that I thought every Canadian knew .
  - Most Canadians know a lot less about the environment than you would expect .
  - This has nothing to do with the environment .
  - Trees  forests and wilderness are the environment .
- - Watched someone flick their phone as if they could somehow BEND GPS to their will ... did nt work sadly ...
  - It works sometimes . Just make sure if there s someone next to you you do nt hit them in the face .
- - It would look nicer if about half of them are replaced by parking lots .
  - Agreed  it would match the highway right next .
- - Tell that to the left wing bleeding heart apologists .
  - I try to ... it s like we are not even speaking the same language .
- - Looks great  What kind of soil are you using

- - Mask of madness is all the craze now
  - Is it really as good as it looks  Im kind of discouraged because of how easily ill be killed since im already so squishy
- - Who the hell figures this stuff out 
  - They probably Leroy Jenkins d it  killed that first Swordbearer really quickly and then were shocked when a second one came out with the thralls .
- - Timeless Miracle - Gates of hell every Timeless Miracle song
  - Woah never thought a song named gates of hell would be so uplifting 
- - Its not what you are saying . Its how you are saying it .
  - if you are confused as to why people have come to that assumption  try reading your post again .
- - I mean he did nt technically miss  but he kinda done fucked up at helms deep by not bringing down the one orc
  - The orc was too tough for arrows .
- - Did I miss something  It seems this economic plan does nt involve creating any private sector jobs .
  - Getting more wealth and prosperity into the hands of the middle class will do wonders for demand and job creation .
- - Please tell me people realize when they said a mighty mouse character  they just mean a small guy who is strong  and not in a mouse costume
  - Some from column A  some from column B
- - What is it exactly  The lighthouse on its side 
  - Not the original guy  but the lighthouse looks a bit like a penis .
- - Well I WAS going to use that type of backsplash in my kitchen this spring  but you ve killed that idea . Any better suggestions 
  - My GF and I built a backsplash out of free tile pieces from Community Forklift . Cost us the price of the adhesive at Home Depot . Maybe try your hand 
- - It was an anti-trust lawsuit that he won . I d be interested to see how the league has adjusted their bylaws to deal with that .
  - I thought it was some kind of contract dispute . My mistake .
- - Does it fire that slow or are you just taking your time firing it 
  - It has a decent fore rate . He was just taking his time letting the cluster bombs settle
- - Ahhhh thanks . Does ot stand for something  I ve been on this sub for a while but still have no clue .
  - It does nt stand for anything as far as I m aware . It appears to have been borrowed from the Lord of the Rings  the tree people .
- - yea  I should open a shop for pitchforks and torches .
  - I ll help . I m with you .
- - For sure man . Commercial free too .
  - Commercial free until they get some listeners . The comedy channel was the same way
- - I m wondering why RDJ has so many iron man toys
  - It s Tony Stark syndrome . You see something based off you and you just start hoarding because you re just that amazing .
- - Honeypot at home seems a bit extreme . I mean  are you really targeted enough to warrant it  What made you decide to go that route
  - Probably should have been more specific  the Linode and remote VPS are hosted elsewhere . I just listed them here because technically they re part of my personal infrastructure .
- - Best player I got was balotelli and even hes pretty shit in fifa
  - At least Fifa balotelli is better than real life Balotelli
- - Haha thanks for finishing off my thought for me  I was still a little tipsy from New Years fun when I wrote that and could nt put a sentence together .
  - It s all good . I had to work . So I was nt able to drink .
- - I live near surprise  and sadly no snow .
  - yep  I work in mesa  it rained all day  came home to deer valley  rained a little more . now it s just grey .
- - Why does the rank gets hidden in the first place 
  - It makes sense  if you re not actively playing mm there s no evidence that you still deserve your rank .
- - Tubs as in those little things they give you fot nuggets ... But weirdly i want a bath tub full of bbq sauce now ...
  - Forgot about those . Shows how long its been since I ate at a McDs or other fast burger place  with In-n-Out the exception .
- - I stuck the USB in the back of the Xbox and ive not had any issues . But I did when it was in the side slot .
  - I m going to try this tonight and see if it s any better . Did nt realize there was a rear USB port .
- - The good news is that the local press seems to be doing their best to shoot this down before it can happen . At least Manish is good for something .
  - Felt like the press was pushing for it at first . What happened 
- - I m a little surprised to be honest . After Kentucky beat us out for Matt Elam I thought we would whiff on Harris too .
  - The fact that Elam was at the announcement had me feeling good .
- - They call it toast because you re supposed to toast it 
  - I was too hungry to wait any longer . It s slightly toasted toast .
- - No  fuck you  We re going to the top  Right ... 
  - No the hivemind says down  I make too much sense 
- - Would nt the massive magnetic field wipe the magstrip 
  - Most of the hospital IDs are RFID or barcode I believe .
- - I could nt tell ya  I did the same thing  but I ordered ike online  heres hoping that everything goes smoothly
  - Same here . Ike and Toon Link  here I come 
- - Toronto  ON  I d love to get in on a stitch and bitch 
  - Ahh  So close yet also so far ... Buffalo  NY 
- - Good suggestions  It does nt look like the weather is going to cooperate though . I d considered something like Dads Garage as well ...
  - I believe the Glenn encloses their rooftop bar in Winter  so it should still be open regardless of the weather .
- - I m too happy to dwell on it right now . Team is finally fun to watch again .
  - I am definitely ecstatic about us being entertaining again  but in the back of my head I m disappointed .
- - Haha This is great . Lip gloss should be covered though since every damn character has incredibly shiny lips . As a side note  do stain resistant sheets actually exist 
  - Resistant . All materials are resistant to some extent so no lies . Ad writers are the devil  water resistant oh sure ...
- - Looks like a cigar near a pile of weed if you ask me ...
  - Little too perfectly rolled I m my mind
- - Kids are allowed to sit in the classroom with their hoodies up  Like they re outside 
  - Probably depends on the teacher and judging by the video he seems like a pretty chill guy
- - He s being accurate . The dungeon items are not Atma  and calling them that may confuse people who are working on their weapons .
  - True . But I think we all knew what was being referred to correct  Since it said Dungeons in the title .
  - Calling something an atma when it is very clearly not an atma is stupid . They are zodiac drops not atma drops .
  - Dude . Its a game . You sound like a kid having a strop .
- - We can take your royal family again .
  - What  you guys are making back-up plans already 
- - I thought she said that Mona was nt in rosewood 
  - you are right i totally forgot about that  i guess that rules this out
- - BTW nice pivot in tone in response to a reasoned comment above
  - Haha thanks for noticing . Try to be respectful to my fellow phan .
- - Sounds like Achilles Tendon . Search for related info . RICE  stretch  cross train  strengthen .
  - Ah  figured it would be something with the Achilles . Looks like I ll have to stretch a lot more . Thanks .
- - He grew up in my town and my mom went to school with him .
  - If going to school with your mom is weird  Id hate to see how weird your mom is .
- - I would nt trust mounting my DSLR on a printed part .
  - I thought the same thing but the part is very sturdy . I tried to snap it in half by hand and could nt .
- - You know  in the last two seasons  Dalton has beaten Brady  Manning and Rodgers ... Just not in any game that fucking matters  of course .
  - Only a Bengals fan would know that .
- - Damit  it s gone already . Anyone have a mirror 
  - Just click on the link  it s working for me .
- - Can this not get reposted every day  I literally saw this a few days ago .
  - This gif was a comment on another post  not a post itself
- - Put your hand down Witten  you cry baby
  - The Cowboys have more cry babies than any other team  I swear
- - Thank you so much . I ll talk to his doctor about it and talk to my mom . Hopefully we can get something going and see what we can do 
  - Depending on what state you re in  you can anonymously report him to the department of motor vehicles and they will require a driving test
- - What if Jenna Coleman is alternate universe Sally Field 
  - I do nt even know if The Doctor could solve that one ... anyone 
- - It s a bowl . Ive played a couple games myself . Short turf  and no wind . It s pretty much the next best thing to kicking indoors .
  - I just rewatched it and there are trees at the end of the field so this is nt a bowl .
- - Its been fixed for a while now .
  - I would hope so  I ve been almost exclusively playing Skirmish .
- - It sounds like both a sexy and a very stupid idea .
  - So is all sex in public . If it was nt stupid it would nt be risky  if it was nt risky  there d be no point .
- - I wonder where that was from . What kind of music do you like 
  - All types  My go-to is emo and the contemporary classical music coming out of Brooklyn right now . What about yourself 
- - Just grab a couple tissues . You can just throw them out after  and you never have to clean anything .
  - But then he d never change his sheets .
- - i play both and i feel for both . RIP ele multistrike being a unique thing . ty blizz .
  - As another player who mained a warlock and shaman I feel it too . It hurts . These are nt the classes I rolled .
- - Check and see if any museums around you offer a free night . You can also check the library and see if they have discounted tickets .
  - This is my favorite thing to do  We went to the museum for my birthday because I love it and it s free .
- - Where d you get the boots and the shirt 
  - He already said the boots are clarks desert Mali and the shirt is Uniqlo
- - Get the more expensive one . I can tell the difference just by the shape of the shoes . You ll be much happier with them .
  - Thanks buying them whenever my funds reach my bhiner account
- - Its more dangerous to pass on the right
  - Than to tailgate because you are trying to go faster than the flow of traffic 
- - Suarez has been poor for Barca and did nothing today .
  - It s going to take time for him to get used to la Liga . It took Neymar an entire season for him to get gelled with the team .
- - These would be some sick bosses in Dark Souls 
  - Agreed . Was also thinking of Dark Souls universe bosses .
- - I believe your talking about abortion providers  not all american doctors .
  - The type of service they offer makes a difference 
- - Just joining  how is the game so far 
  - First half of the first period was bad . Second half was solid .
- - It s been months  excuses are running thin . VoG bugs are not minimal  half the time I spend on the final sections is failed runs due to bugs .
  - What bugs still cause you to wipe so consistently  Sounds more like player excuses claiming things that do nt happen .
- - I love LORAC . Half because it s my favorite Dr. Seuss story  half because they make really good products .
  - Haha  I love that story  LORAC is probably my favorite eyeshadow brand  though I do really love Laura Mercier eye shadows too ...
- - I do nt think I care for your implication .
  - Well  are nt you a spoilt sport .
- - I feel like kanye could work that into a song
  - Foreign ladies in my Mercedes . Traveling to Hati ... s .
- - Beautiful picture  but how did you get this  Did you lower in  Or were you already in and this was your view upward 
  - It was a tour through the lower part of the canyon . This shot was me on the floor looking up .
  - Did they throw the sand in the air for you 
  - Yea I got a photo of that as well
- - Am new to cats . But is it Persian .
  - I guess  I ve never really checked his breed .
- - SE was my first too  keep playing and get better 
  - You too  We should form a club . The club of the DMGs who started as silver elite . Just kidding about the club part the rest is true .
- - What s all the chirping I hear in the background  Did you just keep the output very low and plug into the real tone cable 
  - Sounds like score attack sound effects to me .
- - Think you could help me out   I have an egg with your SV 
  - Sure  I can help you out . I ll be on tonight for another couple hours and again tomorrow around this time .
- - There were leaks about Hydra many weeks before . Going into movie I knew that hydra was there and that Pierce and Sitwell were from Hydra .
  - does this mean that I should avoid this sub a month before Age of Ultron releases 
- - ant man created ultron  no but we have to make ironman everything now . he will create ultron and kill ultron
  - I think it would be pretty lame for a character we have seen nothing of create the most powerful enemy the Avengers have fought thus far .
- - I know I m just being a stickler right now but mostly hotel restaurant specifically chains are not considered fine dining
  - Most of them are nt but some are
- - Too much moisture . You need airflow . Planting all at once  right away raised the humidity level significantly . Sound like you need cross ventilation or a dehumidifier .
  - I think the same . The white mold you see might be a fungus  and they grow in high humidity weather .
- - Most of the time the argument is wrapped around the No True Scotsman fallacy .
  - That s not true  Sometimes it s just ignorance .
- - Anywhere in the U.P . besides state parks are going to be quiet .
  - Can you just pitch a tent anywhere or what  What exactly do you mean by that 
- - the cheese is great but that vanquisher with field scout and third eye is all that i want
  - I think the planets aligned the day that dropped for me haha
- - ohhh  got it . thats what i thought haha
  - He probably is nt  he s a detective . Do nt tell him anything .
- - No . You re not fluent yet . Only add skills which you ve completely mastered . Also  beware typos . You have one in your title .
  - Thanks  i ll be careful about that too .
- - As someone who does nt get the joke  would you be willing to explain 
  - Its just sarcasm . Jpeg introduces loads of visual artifacts the higher you go on compression  and the actual compression algorithm is nt that good anymore in the first place .
  - I do nt like this particular change . I like to download porn  and webm does nt loop in my viewer like gif does .
  - It can . Depends how it s encoded .
- - Hahahahha ... why do we keep throwing to Tate  He s not an NFL WR
  - No idea how this guy has been on our roster for so long ... He s not even tht good of a returner
- - I know this is a stupid thing to say but I forgot that conjoined twins is a thing . Do nt see it very much anymore  any reason 
  - Most likely medical technology has gotten to the point where it s much safer to separate the twins at birth 
- - I ve been really digging these guy s show more and more lately .
  - Bryan and Brandon go together like peanut butter and jelly
- - Dear Merritt and Gavin No  God No  Hell No  Please No
  - Oh  come on . It would be great for the Timbers and for the city . Drogba is a legend . No one was better in old-school FIFA
  - For what he will cost and for what he will produce  no . And a Chelsea player   Barf
  - As much as I hate chelsea ... drogba is still banging in goals at the top level  it would nt be a horrible call .
- - That s it . Invincible is mine tonight .
  - Did you even read the guide  This trick only works on Transmog gear  You ll never get Invincible  You ve just got to accept it 
- - dumbfucks still think look a likes are funny  fuck you and all the smug look a like posts
  - all niggers are the same  cmon .
- - Yep  i have that victini you speak of .
  - I ll grab this Victini from the guy above ya  but if you still have a request I ll be glad to take care of it .
  - It s okay . I do nt even know what services i need
  - Well  if you think of something do nt be afraid to contact me .
- - If it helps  certain challenges unlock custom moves . That s all I know
  - Thanks  I added some info to the OP .
- - I would LOVE to play a game where I could literally duel the devil with rock .
  - That can definitely be a thing in exalted . One of the big bads of the setting has a habit of holding dance offs its canon .
- - That looks like Mashed Potatoes and Gravy ... Where s the WTF part 
  - pretty much . the only WTF might be the sounds it makes as it s dispensing .
- - How do you feel about this comment now 
  - The Panthers are a bit of a wild card . Who know what they will play like  That is a bit disconcerting .
- - You ca nt use those two cards together on the same fabric .
  - Is this a driver compatibility issue or are they inherently different 
- - The team is his business . The main goal in business is to make money .
  - Which is a different statement than your previous one  and still a subjective opinion on what business is .
- - This is awesome . Any chance it could be reflection or an error
  - I watched some behind the scenes once where they said they intentionally added the third arm .
- - This is an absolutely beautiful album . Great work .
  - Thanks a lot man . I ve become attached to each of these in one way or another so it s nice to hear you say that .
- - That is not a cassoulet . Cassoulet s have beans in them .
  - I agree  this has no resemblance to a cassoulet whatsoever . Does look tasty though .
- - The Devil You Know or Vision of Confluence  Icebreaker and Hunger of Crota is my current go to loadout .
  - Devil You Know will always be with me no matter how powerful other guns get i will find a place for it .
- - Probably should have just broke into his house and killed the family dog on a night when everyone was home . Just as ethical as what this guy claims he did .
  - No  I think murdering a member of the family is a bit worse than ruining someone s credit . Your comment is embarrassing and melodramatic .
- - I really want it to be good . I m still afraid that it wo nt be . But I REALLY want it to be good .
  - It s gotten pretty good reviews so far 
- - Absolutely loved wallflower and I am currently in Sheboygan  people here really enjoy your work .
  - I would love a current photo of my piece there if you would be so kind  I ll send you stickers
- - I feel pretty shitty the next day after toking
  - What kind do you smoke and how much
- - Sounds like a bluff to get OP to pay a fine . Psychology  similar to the whole bad cop scenario .
  - Would be pretty funny to get an email with the pictures and link to video  like they do with red light cameras .
- - Mouse only . o  but honestly good luck with that mouse only players are quite pro
  - Thanks  I m considering selling my soul to Peppy and buying an osu  tablet when they are available . But I might just stick with mouse .
- - lol  how about you post from your real account bro .
  - i make a new one every once in awhile to avoid being doxxed by faggots like you .
- - Why does his son have so much white stuff on his shorts 
  - the bigger question is why is he wearing shorts 
- - How did the burns occur  Some serious shit must have happened .
  - She was putting fuel on a cooker ...
- - I m definitely gon na try this  there must be something similar here .
  - Good luck  I hope to hear of a massive savory success .
- - Do you question the validity of Pew Research 
  - Not in general . Was this a Pew survey 
- - It was cool . Very early game . Had a man in a spacesuit and featured time travel .
  - I know which one you are talking about . As a kid I never got past the swinging bridge thing .
- - In what fucking world is that ever coming across sincerely after seeing hundreds of movies with a stereotypical snooty british guy saying it when he s being all pretentious .
  - I ve spent too much time on the internet . A corny movie sound like a great idea . Thanks .
- - When will the selectors learn and put in a second spinner 
  - No fit spinner good enough to warrant dropping a quick . Even on this track .
- - New users will automatically have grant login access . Ask Salesforce Support to turn it on permanently via a case and you wo nt have to do anything else .
  - Indeed it is a one time request and vital as an admin  IMO .
- - If you lived in the desert and wished for rain every day but that one  it would be .
  - It s like you got ten thousand spoons  but all you need is for the voices to stop screaming so loudly in your head .
- - Ca nt wait to play good football like we did in the second half .
  - that was some seriously promising stuff compared to the first half
- - why did you throw away the water pipe  awesome video and now makes me want to do something sweet like this peace
  - it broke when I was cleaning it  broke my heart so I threw the fucker away . you make a video  start today 
- - What molecules are you vibrating in space

  - Add me on Game Center . GC . Alli Woods
- - I am so proud of you stranger .
  - One foot in front of the other ...
- - It s the perfect house for someone who does nt want kids because once you have kids in that house say goodbye to all of the beautiful furniture .
  - Hence  why that is all staging furniture . Although  I am sure the purchaser can give a offer with furniture included .
- - There s two kinds of people who will answer this question . Honest people and liars .
  - And people who were nt in fact attracted to any of their cousins .
  - Sorry you do nt have a hot family .
  - No need to apologize . You get used to it after awhile .
- - Exactly  his best trait is that I hate him . That means he is awful . Plus  I can definitely continue to hate him after his death . . D
  - Never stop doing what you re doing  Severus .
- - Someone tell these kids to put at least a mod between their lips and the battery .
  - Its all the manufacturers fault . They keep making kids with hybrid connections .
- - DO NT WORRY GUYS . WE RE YELLING AT OUR BOYS . STARTING THE SECOND STRONG .
  - Based on what I remember of Raleigh  there are probably more Bruins fans there - right 
- - Yeah ... that stick was above his fucking shoulders
  - Problem is  his shoulders are below the crossbar .
- - As long as his insurance covers your bike and medical bills  why bother  Especially with no lost wages
  - Because his insurance will do everything they can to pay the bare minimum .
- - But hey  at least I know the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell .
  - Still the most important thing Highschool taught me .
- - So are all of the other games on this list besides the stick of truth . Being rushed by their publisher is Obsidian s trademark .
  - Did I whoosh that  I think I whooshed that .
- - Natural selection  please run your course .
  - We could use a zombie apocalypse . Just a small one .
- - This is one of the more famous foreign policy quotes . Henry Kissinger s stuff is great reading all around  and is very much realist .
  - I just have a problem calling this liar a realist . It seems he knows the truth . Uses the truth for his own self interest but spews lies .
- - A few girl friends and I still have nt decided on NYE plans yet  is the house weed friendly 
  - There is a designated smoking area so I guess yes
- - I definitely would . Maybe the degree you re looking to complete along with an expected completion date . Also  congrats 
  - Thanks for the advice . And thank you 
- - Can I ask you something  I need to RUN away  get out and then return to that area or just touch RUN and battle again 
  - Yes it was worth checking . I got my latios eventually . You can kill instead of running away too . The stats of Latias will generate each fight
- - she looks like Dara s more cute younger sister haha
  - Ah yeah  thats who she reminded me of . D
- - How did a skull spawn in the boss rush room 
  - When you go into a room random chance a rock breaks . This includes skulls  so if the skull randomly breaks it can spawn a Host .
- - This is so in depth and rich with information THANK YOU 
  - You re quite welcome . Let me know if you have any other questions  always happy to help .
- - people are free to believe whatever they want  i take issue when their beliefs cause hurt and harm to people  as in this case .
  - I just do nt understand why you reserve almost all of your umbrage for the faithful  and very little for the faith .
- - lmao Assassin s Creed games now sure do look thought out with only yearly releases compared to monthly releases of this
  - Five nights at freddie s is a game that is fun for only a few hours . Of course the games are going to be released more than big AAA games .
- - Lol sorry I guess I m too white .
  - LOL it s all good you da white MVP
- - It s almost as if the story is completely made up . Hmm ...
  - It s almost as if you re nasty for the sake of being nasty . Hmm ...
- - Yes . Someone has fucked me in the ass to establish dominance  no lube . I am not a troll .
  - This is the weirdest novelty account I ve ever seen . Carry on  good sir .
