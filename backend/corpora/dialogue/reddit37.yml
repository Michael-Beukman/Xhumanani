  - The shooters must surely realize their only choice is death by swat team or years of torture . They will get their martyr wish  most likely .
- - You do understand that nuclear weapons today are REALLY  REALLY powerful . Using one on a country that you share a planet with is batshit insane .
  - The point is extreme destructive capacity . This capacity is not necessarily nuclear . MAD can be achieved many ways depending on the context .
- - The guy isnt even asking for internet provider info which would help . All he gon na get is a map with points and ping numbers which wont help show anything .

  - maybe he s standing on some kind of cortosis woven ground .
- - Dang  I really like that shirt . I m guessing you re in Miami  but where did you get that from 
  - I m actually in Kentucky  so I have no idea where he went shopping . It must have been hiding behind the UofL and UK gear .

  - Watch his fight with RDA . He owned RDA  the guy who just destroyed Nate Diaz  TKO d Henderson recently and beat Cerrone last year .
- - STEPH  STEPH  STEPH  shirt .
  - The proceeds went to Connor s Cure  I believe ...
- - Not really relevant  but I ve been learning Python recently so I was wondering if you could post the script you used just so I can see how it works 
  - After such a great response to this post  I will do a more in depth analyses of the data dump with a link to all the scripts I used .
- - Looks good  Reminds me of Jake Gyllenhaal
  - Lol  that s exactly what my girlfriend said  and then we watched Zodiac after .

- - No no  the pilot was Sum Ting Wong .
  - See farther down for a link with the whole list .
- - What sort of battery are these  It depends on a whole lot of things .
  - It s hypothetical . I guess when I thought of the question I was thinking of AA batteries .
  - Knowing the AH rating is the only way to know for sure  either from the official specs or by testing the battery yourself
  - You ll probably never get actual specs from consumer batteries .
- - The Departed  The Godfather  Star Wars . I ca nt bring myself to watch old movies .

- - Was scrolling through on my phone . Did nt expect the selfie and I need new pants
  - Same here  thankfully I was on the can  so that helped ...

  - Thank you for sharing  Have some gold for it .
- - I m not saying they re the same  but I do nt see how recognizing your reflection in a mirror is directly relevant to religion either .
  - What I m saying is . If an animal ca nt recognize themselves in a mirror  how can they be smart enough to form a religion 
- - Your situation is nt that unique . You just need another job . Start applying .
  - Thats good to know I felt like I have kind of a weird career development . I m already applying around .

- - huh  did nt even know about this holiday maintenance until now ; i presumed it was up as I am currently able to open initiates chests
  - Yeah  anyone can open Initiates chests for the time being . That was publicly announced too .
- - that would go against the discussion ... being biased and all would rather look at it as a whole ...
  - The whole is you trying to find some way to say Thibs does nt play players a lot when one of his players consistently leads the league in minutes played
- - I want to follow an MLS team  but I just feel spoiled watching Bayern . Are there any worth following  DC United would be my closest team to me .

- - Clearly  Manila s Teletubbie and Bad Girl runways alone should have earned her the crown
  - Her bad girl look still gives me life  no words could describe how much I love it  it was truly sickening 
- - She either took his empty hammershot  or drew an empty hammershot that she had . Either way the blaster is empty . P
  - Which honest to God is nt important at all . Seriously . It s a short promo clip  not war footage lol .

  - Source  This is absolutely nuts if its true

  - NS was fun but it just did nt grab me . I still have it installed tho .
- - You know ... Except Yamori who had his eaten by Kaneki and still tried to kill Suzuya .
  - He said kaneki did nt eat all of it which is why he survived .
- - Well  maybe by that time the digital account system will be a bit better ...

- - I once heard that the Chevy Astro van has some kind of bizarre cult following in Japan .

  - Buying it will also pretty much guarantee you that it will drop for you in the nightfall next week too  .
- - Sludge belcher needs a nerf  almost EVERY deck runs them
  - Most decks have Sludge Belcher because of the abundance of aggro and zoo . I tried running Spectral Knight instead but aggro just ran past .

  - plus  this also shows your dealer that the guy is cool . and smoking out your dealer usually gets you hooked up fatter 
- - Slowly catching up to what PC gamers have been enjoying for quite some time now .

  - That quote does nt say anything substantive about how they act .
- - I m not shovelling until it stops snowing
  - We have way too much driveway to wait . I could nt imagine trying to do it all at once .
- - I feel like people are just moving random things now .
  - That s what I thought when I first saw it ... Then I remembered where I live ...

  - Have fun watching shitty kobe and the Lakers this year jackass . You deserve this season and more 
- - Much worse if the crab lived through being ripped away from its exoskeleton . It d be like you surviving a full-body degloving .
  - Well not necessarily . I mean it would still obviously be horrible but the comparison is nt really accurate since crustaceans are supposed to shed their shells .
- - Your edit is really  really sharp . I like your crop suggestion  but I think the sharpness almost detracts from the image .
  - It helps when you have it full size vs a small print where it can look weird .
- - I mean  what else is is good for 
  - Hollow it out  put some doors over where the tube was and make a liquor cabinet out of it 
  - That s pretty good . Aquariums are also nice .
  - A bit more of a lift  skill-wise  but definitely doable .
- - hey I m gon na give it a try where are you recording it 
  - We are going to cast live on Twitch and record it and put it up on iTunes . Possibly Youtube too
- - It s the brunette to Sweden s blonde
  - Finland has more blondes per capita than Sweden . So it would be the other way around .
- - Why does he think Americans want to hear his fucking opinion on every thing  Stuart Scott has nothing to do with anything under the scope of the presidency .
  - Why do you think we want to hear yours 
- - I really like the way that you frame and compose your images 
  - Thanks  I m still trying to learn the art of composition and how to balance a photo just right . Great motivation

- - I hate to ruin it for you  but football is almost completely different than hockey .
  - The slot position is pretty new and was not very popular in the past . It s not like the slot position was always integral to the offense .
- - true  but seeing the violin strings going through the bow and the awkward splotches of brown on the fingerboard in-between the fingers really irks me
  - Ah  I see it now . I was mostly focusing on the bigger picture rather than the details .
- - Does anyone have a pic of that one MSU player pointing his hand the wrong way following the onside kick 
  - No  but he did it twice . I was chuckling . He was so excited  he did nt know which way up was .

  - would nt complain if it s not a dupe lol to bad that it is .
- - Can I request for an ahoge outline for Saber 
  - Sorry to sound dumb  but whats an ahoge outline 
- - The Wii U is great for this as well . The only way I ve been able to get gaming in for weeks on end .
  - Had I not already had the Vita  I would have put more consideration into getting a WiiU .
- - That s ... That s not a given
