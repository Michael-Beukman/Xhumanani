  - There s numerous Law and Order and Law and Order . Criminal Intent episodes with similar stories involving the wealthy .

  - More like all the decks . But there are guides on how to do it with basic cards .
- - When has that ever happened  Certainly not at sporting events  anyway . I ve literally never heard the words being sung during a sporting event .
  - Olympics is where I notice it the most .
- - Of course  but you could only throw one per attack
  - ok  so I could be wielding the sword and shield  use quick draw to ready the short spear  and use the standard action to throw it 
- - Hate to burst your bubble  but this particular freak was KDF .
  - Hate to burst your bubble  but that does nt preclude them from being on ESD .

  - I survived . The teachings of Michael Scott survive .
- - Is it worth re-reading or should I wait 
  - Eh not really  so far they re pretty similar .
- - The only thing that comes to mind is oils
  - Oil is nt considered a liquid is it  is nt it in the same category as wax  Also not all oils burn
  - oil is most certainly a liquid . It can also have a solid phase and exist as wax  but oil is a liquid
  - Is nt this just relatively speaking anyway  Technically anything could be a solid  liquid  or gas given certain value sets of pressure and temperature .
- - All I know is  if Rafael dos Anjos can knockout Benson Henderson  Cerrone can too .
  - Not necessarily ... and for the record RDA knocked Cerrone down too
- - Those look like they would work . How would a valve have gotten in there  It does nt look like that though it really just looks like a short thin socket
  - Post a picture of what is there .
- - Cory Joseph  Manu  Boris Diaw  Bellinelli  Patty Mills  Baynes and Matt Boner . Spurs are pretty deep too .
  - Most of those players  if placed outside of the Spurs  would nt be considered nearly as good .

- - Because nobody looks into shit  they just do it and hope for the best .
  - Are nt you just a bundle of joy .
- - White people do nt want to shop with black people . It s really that simple .
  - White people shop with black people all the time in Maryland  it s unavoidable . See Columbia  Arundel Mills  Eric . Even Tysons in VA .
- - The whole anger management thing could have been an embarrassing wreck  but between Bryan s exuberance and Kane s weird surreal sense of humor  it was really funny .
  - I like Kane s sense of humour . He had his moments when he was with RVD like when he got Snakes and Ladders for Christmas .
- - The funny thing is that a plane never really goes backwards .
  - Except when backing away from a gate 
- - I know he as creative control over chappie so it should be good from what Ive heard from people involved .

- - Almost as big as OP s mom .
  - I do nt know man  if they add a few more galaxies she just might fit .
- - All I want is for Ichiro to go to a team where he will get to play more often than not .
  - That would not be Miami . Their OF is pretty damned solid .

- - The guy on the right ca nt hold both arms up .
  - Because he s too busy holding his pants up
- - Do nt think we need another OP automatic weapon clone .
  - The same way we did nt need another OP scoped weapon but yet we got the DMR . Such is life .
- - I m guessing the recipient is a black woman  Otherwise he s lost me .
  - OP is not a black woman  as much as I have wanted to be one  because they are sexy as hell  I am not .
- - I thought this was common knowledge about her . You would think he knew . Also  who is this guy  he looks like Mitch Hedberg .
  - He s actually just Dennis Leary repackaged as Carlos Mencia .
- - Young PAC somehow looks even weirder than muscle-bound Adrian Neville .
  - Maybe he had nt grown into his ears as much .
- - No they re not  fuck the Galaxy . They d be tolerable if they did nt win so goddamn much

  - The penalty thing never came up . It sorta freezes my game for a second when there is a penalty ...

  - He might if you have an active stick .
- - It s called a split seam . It can easily be repaired . But do nt use wood glue if you value the guitar . Use granulated hide glue .
