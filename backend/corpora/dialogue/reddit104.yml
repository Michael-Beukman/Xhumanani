  -  I did nt call you anything .
- - I talked to him in Kansas and he said he would be at Roo .
  - You talked to him in Kansas   So did I ... in Lawrence . Were you there in VIP  too  
- - Hmm . Maybe I do nt know what I m missing 
  - Check it out  I m sure your mind will be blown .
- - From you post history  you re pretty much anything but getting down voted .
  - He just really loves up votes . He loves them enough to lie about not getting any .
- - Wow that got me hard  So cool . what is that milling apparatus
  - I ca nt tell his exact rig  but Google chainsaw mill or Alaska mill
- - Propably dumb question  what are possible consequences after getting a seizure 
  - It could be a sign of other bigger problems present
- - Wait really  What is this  fury warriors in wrath 
  - For real  Colossal Smash and Mortal Strike on CD  Better spam whirlwind 
- - Wow  that s a clever and accurate joke that nobody s ever made before . Good show .
  - I m here for you  everything will be fine
- - Sounds like someone s reeeeally bitter now that they have to actually use the app as intended . Life goes on  my friend . You ll be okay .
  - I work from home  it is not a problem for me . But it sure is going to be a problem for anyone who has ever done a brag post .
- - exactly  people would have found an excuse like this no matter what the timing of the election was .
  - You should delete that post  technically you are defending the LNP which is basically the same as admitting you rape kids on this website .
- - The Original shoots rockets directly from your center  whereas the Rocket Launcher shoots them from your right .
  - Woops  I misread what OP said . I understand now .
- - i do nt recommend it due to possible damage of discs  i always recommend sitting it flat .
  - The discs will be fine  unless they move the console while its running
- - I came to post this . It is my go to  primer when someone asks about R.O.B .
  - This was also the first thing I thought of as the best way to explain ROB haha .
- - I do nt think this belongs here .
  - Probably  feel free to remove . I tend to like live better than drawing .
- - Haha I know what it means  I m Canadian . Just wanted the outsiders to think we are nt as polite as we are .
  - We are nt as polite as they think  that s why we have to keep it a secret
- - Please use the search bar . This was just asked .
  - Thanks for letting me know  should ve looked . Do you remember the title 
- - Do you seriously not think assertive men and women are treated differently  One is treated as ideal while the other is undesirable .
  - And what evidence besides tumblr and Dove do you have for that
- - I would nt say its about the difficulty for me . I just prefer the way Mario controls and feels .
  - Controlling DK feels like I m trying to drive a tank across a tightrope .
- - Sounds like you are in the friendzone .
  - Thank you for the response but that s irrelevant  since I probably will never make a move on her again . I just want answers to my last questions .
- - Maybe something about removing the concrete barriers .
  - In the world of civic projects  that s a drop in the bucket .
- - Photosphere support pretty much removes any need for the Photos app for me
  - The last update to the Photos app removed any need for the Photos app for me .
  - Wait the gallery app or the photos app 
  - Photos . I like gallery  but it is gone in Lollipop .
  - Wow  I think you might be the single person on earth with that view ... no offense but the gallery app was godawful
  - No way  almost every person I ve talked to about this misses the gallery app . Myself included
  - The lack of the gallery app is the sole reason I installed Quickpic .
  - Same here . Photos is an abomination .
- - I do nt think it matters . You will likely still have to go in because of banking laws they need to verify your identity .
  - Very true  I will go ahead and put in the app . Thanks 
- - This is a serious situation  you should log off this site and go speak to a therapist .
  - What is so serious about this

  - Yes you do . They do end up on sale quite often which is nice .
- - I highly suggest fog  very easy to set up and get wiping . Honestly  it would probably take one afternoon to get this set up .
  - Yup . Takes about one afternoon if you know what you re doing . About a day if not .
- - Yes . She s getting paid to engage in sinful behavior  and being paid to be an object for someone else s sinful behavior .
  - What exactly do you think is the sin 
- - Uhh please tell me this is nt real  EDIT . Also  that is way too many hashtags . Why does everybody go so overboard with them 
  - Every time I see hash tags  my first thought is . if you deep fried them  they d be hash browns .
- - Troy Brown is smarter than you . That s my answer .
  - Even so  he s dead wrong .
- - I do nt understand the dutch approach to marijuana  why allow its sale but forbid its growth  why not either legalize or ban both

  - Oh  look at the clever dickhole over here . Bein  a dickhole .

  - Oh silly me . D I knew that lol
- - Can you tell me the one you use
  - I ve been using Astrill since last year . Works well depending on the time of day . Speed is pretty good  YouTube loads at a decent rate .
- - A full auto Thompson fires from an open bolt and the semi-auto fires from a closed bolt  so probably not .
  - Thank you  I do nt know enough about them obliviously . Just hoping to find viable options for the kit
- - Personally I think the treasure chest still looks great .
  - I agree it looks fine  I just think it would be something cool to add

  - They do nt  I could have sworn this one did . Then again  it was a while ago . I might have mixed a couple different encounters together .
- - How did you get that purple background 
  - If you use LoungeDestroyer you can implement your own custom lounge theme
- - Again with the trolling about sitting on the edge of the sofa . Get a life  kid .
  - You re wrong . Please help with the pelvic nerves
- - shitlord on the sidewalk does nt even brake stride
  - She was probably holding back all the laughter
- - But they definitely consider that revolving door . I wonder which companies board of directors Wheeler will end up on .
  - Honestly  probably none of them . He s no spring chicken and has already made his money . My best guess is he retires after his term is up .
- - Hey  sorry I missed you  Just message me when you re around and I ll try to be on by then .
  - I am free and online now . Thanks 
- - From a Vikings fan standpoint  A lot of this applies to the AP situation . Do not judge an entire fan base from the opinions of an outlier .
  - Absolutely  and it applies to tons of situations . It d be pretty easy to find one for every team .
- - Marc Maron s WTF podcast . Sound Opinions . Podcasts in general . Audiobook  maybe . It s good to break that up between an hour or two of music .
  - Cool I ll check those out thanks man .
- - Do you think anyone would be willing to pick up Peks contract  For a big man who ca nt protect the rim it is a huge gamble
  - Nyet . How many games does he actually play in a season  Looks boss in a blazer and blue jeans  though .
- - So I no longer need Sieq and Flynn 
  - Sieq s still useful at late game  keep him . About Flynn  I think he s pretty useless atm .
- - I m probably being stupid but why is it such a different colour compared to BHO 
  - I believe because this was nt ran with a solvent
- - Oooh I d LOVE her . How long are you gon na be keeping her in boxes 
  - How much time do you think you ll need 
- - If you can dodge her skillshots or eliminate her plants she is pretty useless and squishy
  - That s true . Maybe it s just because I m a relatively low rank  but most people ca nt dodge all of them .
- - How can you possibly be surprised about hypocrisy from them at this point  I mean really .
  - Can we just talk about how on point this post is 
- - I got Shadow of Mordor on the last day of the Steam sale and even on medium settings  the visuals in this game rape majority of games on ultra settings .
  - I hope there s a sequel to it . The game is just refreshing tbh .
- - Again  you offer nothing but insults . Sorry  I ve got better things to do . Have a nice day .
  - Right  do nt let the door hit you on your way out . Have fun fighting The Man 
- - maybe its time for people to accept responsibility for policing them selves . than we would nt need cops
  - Well it s not like the police are giving them the opportunity to .
- - C.S . Friedman has a great magic system in the Cold Fire trilogy  one of my favorites . Also one of my favorite protagonist  antagonist relationships .
  - I also liked the system in the magister trilogy  Kind of ... evil .
- - Next to the spark plug sparks reservoir . You could be running out of sparks quickly if you re using it daily  and nobody wants that  right 
  - Dammit  you re right . And do nt forget the blinker fluid .
- - Calm your boner  it s a joke about how shit watto is .
  - My erection can not be calmed whilst smudge is at the crease .
- - If you define differently coloured sacks as being tailored . Have you ever looked at the plus sized section  That s basically all it is .
  - They have plus size womens clothing stores as well and stores for small women .

- - All expenses paid as in they pay you a salary or ... 
  - As in  my flights to and from China  plus housing .
- - If all your job is is flipping burgers for hours then expecting to make any more than minimum wage is flat out delusional .
  - The question is nt who should get minimum wage but what minimum wage should be .
- - better than i deserve . how about you 
  - thats nice  oh mines pretty awful pretty alone and sad .
  - aww ... what made it awful and sad  and i m here now  so you are not alone
  - I just want to see my bf  but he never comes to town .
- - All of the large grocery stores in Bellevue  WA have those . Like Fred Meyer has them too 
  - I ve never seen these at freds are they with the bulk 
- - They suck each other s dicks . Nothing more  nothing less .
  - Haha  you all are so mad .
  - Yes . I am very mad . I m not gon na lie  I hope aaron rodgers tears up the cowboys .

  - I fell asleep  Now I want to go the beach .
- - I have a brother who likes playing online in the same room with me .
  - You can do that via other means  like anthers ladder
- - You must ve served in Utah or Idaho .
  - Indeed . That meal was in Boise North Stake when I was on a split with another companionship .
- - I m down  Can add you once I get home
  - Cool  ca nt wait to play .
- - I was just thinking that maybe we need a winger who can cross and stretch the pitch .
  - Are wingers do nt really cross . That s what are LB and RB do . They make runs towards the box .
- - Why  Its one if the most natural things . I know we are all different and i am just asking to better my understanding .
  - Shitting is just as natural  but you do nt see me bringing a Big Mac into the stall with me .
- - It s a shame I am from a different region from you 
  - It doesnt matter . It only means we will not be able to play together but I can still give you tips and analyze your replays with you .
- - We do nt have to be strangers ... Found this place about a month ago now ... I m just your friendly bus driver ...
  - English teacher in Barcelona . Good to meet ya 
- - What a douche . That cat wanted another  just left him hanging .
  - Like he wanted the high five plus a pound it at the end
- - Now You See Me was surprisingly good . Very likable cast in my opinion .
  - Same here . I went to see it for a friend s birthday and expected something mediocre . I actually really enjoyed it .
- - Agreed . I have some nice games as well  but usually restricted people just make me wan na die .
  - At least those people are nt in ranked . God bless .
  - I do nt play ranked  so I have to get all the toxic players who are restricted  Does nt seem fair to me ...
  - They should make a ranked prison where it s draft pick but only rank restricted people can play with rank restricted people .
- - They can bully him all he wants but the fact remains that it s legal . What city was this in btw 
  - It was in Philadelphia . Home of the liberty bell .
- - I always sneak in food . Burritos  hamburgers  chili cheese fries . Never beem told anything . People have actually asked for some .
  - Ugh  I would hate that . It smells a bunch  and I would get crazy jealous .
- - People do nt know what he is or where he came from . Most men assume he was an elf .
  - An elf that looks so old  Do nt they stop aging after a point 
- - Still rubbish and not beer . Friends do nt let friends drink Rogue products .
  - Not ... beer  How do you figure 
- - Ah  sorry about that . I am just taking a snapshot at user request .
  - You should change all links in this thread to np links .
- - remind me not to rent any property to you ...
  - im an environmental scientist just like you  I promise im the best tenant you could have . Just dont get on my bad side
- - what division do i have to be to coach 
  - Divisions and such are not an issue . Previous experience is preferred though . If you re new to coaching  diamond preferred .
- - Whoa  I wonder why they did that  It was  like  THE perk .
  - right  the only reason i had gold or gifted it was for that reason .
- - I just played the demo . I do nt think I will ne able to get into this game .
  - Care to explain why you think so  Not upset  just curious - it grabbed me and I felt like it was impossible to put down .
  - The storyline did nt really appeal to me and just overall kind of weird .
  - So you re looking for a fairly run of the mill story then or maybe just a different genre 
- - From everything I can see  ... that can not be removed . So looks like you re hosed .
  - Okay thank you for letting me know and helping me
- - Fuck man I did not want to see that .
  - I mean  it s marked nsfw ...
- - Nice try MIB  but not this time . Video is clearly proof of aliens  Nobody is gon na believe you anymore 
  - Some swamp gas was released by a weather balloon near Venus .
- - I forced it down when I was younger . THE END . I remember it hurt  but surprisingly I did not get scars or anything .
  - For me this happened during sex . Kinda scared my girlfriend away from BJ s for a while .
- - That s not what I said . Or at least not what I meant to say . What I meant to say was . Raw saffron is shit food .
  - No you re right ... I misread . I do nt agree with the OP though

- - A lot of the ash would blow east to Europe . You re better off being an Aussie .
  - Id rather deal with the volcano than Australia  thanks .
- - What about when Klaus actually did take on a dozen hybrids with a claymore 
  - That too  That was such a successful slaughter  I wonder why he has never reused that tactic .
- - That s so sad . They re celebrating that they ve given up on themselves .
  - That pretty much sums up what the Fat Acceptance movement is all about .
  - I thought it was about getting hot dudes to bone you
  - Really  This movement seems like my kind of thing  where do I sign up 
- - Uncle Dane . One of the few engineer mains on youtube  and has some really insightful commentary on engineer that you do nt really get anywhere else .
  - I ve played Dustbowl with him quite a few times . Really great engie .
- - What measures has the right honourable gentleman taken to ensure the prevention of a future potato famine 
  - The severe reliance upon the potato is not at the levels it once was  and our education emphasis the values of a balanced and varied diet .
- - I do nt think that matters as much . Just be as calm as possible .
  - I thought you were aware that Hispanic moms have a reputation for being violent
- - I would nt feel its worth it  but that s me . Not when I can get a new  although grey market  for less delivered to my door .
  - I think they can deliver as well but worried I will be slapped with import duty . Where would you get them from 
- - I ve tried  do nt work .
  - You should try working out and building your physique . Then less will get away .
- - To keep the friends at a safe distance away
  - and your enemies really close . in the crosshairs
- - You re thinking of the bobbit worm .
  - That s it . That thread was like reading an internet forum version of Oldman and the Sea . An internet treasure .
- - loda  hanni  pajkatt  akke  notail
  - I d say it s more likely that Bulldog will stay than Hanni will be there .
- - I doubt that has had any measurable effect on wage stagnation . Software engineers are one of the few groups where wages have increased significantly .
  - My intent was to imply that I believe it s much more widespread than this case  albeit more informal .
- - what languages do you speak and what language would you like to learn
  - Lao  Thai  and French . I want to learn Spanish  German  and Italian so I can travel Europe without looking like some fool
- - I m not  but if I were  why would that be good to know  Sorry buddy  I m not looking for anyone . Fatty .
  - Just saying to be attracted to a male body would mean you have some pretty deep seeded homosexuality . You have fun with being in the closet though .
  - She s leagues hotter than any girl that will ever touch you .
  - Well I like a woman with a woman s body  much like my wife . This man that you find so attractive is more for closeted homosexuals like yourself .
- - Just go pre order dude  Save yourself the trouble 
  - This is the answer to all things .
- - they cant afford him to wrestle a schedule they need in a champion though . literally cant afford him monetarily i mean .
  - wwe have the money . they are still the largest wrestling company in the world . its bs but they can afford it I m sure .
- - Excellent work  I think some people just do nt understand how important reference is . Keep up the good work 
  - Thank you  I appreciate it . Yeah  people often have an unrealistic expectation of what it means to work at this level .
- - Would nt breathing through the mouth  like dogs do  help to bring down the temperature 
  - Give it a try and let us know
- - The XP bonus is a huge help so the reward you get for completing the nightfall is just an extra reward .
  - I forgot about the XP bonus . That is one plus .
- - LOL WISP  Is that what people consider hard now 
  - You have to resist tping team-mates into fountain .
- - Jeez  that s a really depressing name for it

- - They are probably manufacturing coarse sandpaper condoms  too .
  - I hear they are developing barbed wire anal beads as well .
- - Congratulations bro  I need a rocket too and I believe I can do it  Keep sharing your feedback here . It s really helpful .
  - Thanks  brah  You ll get your rocket 
- - guys all we need to do is not let em get a first shot right 
  - If we can pull that off  we should be able to get at least a point out of this .
- - I do nt know how I m gon na sell this one in the previews ...
  - Make them think he s fighting Andy Ruiz .
- - Leicester should be gutted . It looks like it might be off his face but his arm was outstretched . Theyve been on top of the game too .
  - We are gutted  apart from that Vardy penalty against United  pretty much every big decision this season so far seems to have gone against us .
- - Thank you so much this sounds great  Where should I hide my bud if I need to be discreet 
  - Pill bottles and Mason Jars  brah . Any glass jar with a tight lid  really .
- - Why take a fair catch there  Might as well let it go .
  - That s what I m literally screaming .
- - Definitely not a whoosh  my reflexes are too good . But does nt Nasa use Tor  Or was that the Navy 
  - It s a copypasta  Ultron does nt exist .
- - Carhartt WIP Clash Parka  Not sure if the tails are as long as you have in mind .
  - that s a good option  but their out in my size
- - I would love a minor glyph for feral s that would allow you to play Claws  but look like the normal cat form .
  - Or at least let me stay a lady in catman form .
- - There see many places untouched by the winters and fighting . Most notably Dorne .
  - Eh  trouble s stirring . It s only a matter of time .
- - I did it randomly a couple of times . I noticed absolutely no difference .
  - This is the kind of advice I was hoping for . Thank you .
- - Burden of proof is on the person making the claim .
  - you do nt understand Russel s Teapot then you do nt understand why your statement is fallacious .
- - Is it worth it for someone left handed 
  - Lefty  it s great . Did nt use the stand at all .
- - I m gon na say this game is going into OT  since you know  the Spurs are playing
  - december is over . we re not having any of that crap anymore
- - I was interested in The Crew on Steam  then i read the part about a UPlay account ...
  - Rented The Crew on my Xbox One  it s very boring . You re better off going without the game entirely .
- - I m ok  I need to take a shower but I m too lazy to get my ass up hbu
  - I m at work  sitting and doing nothing
- - I d hire a Japanese Woman as Motoko  call me crazy .
  - I think most would  yes  hahaha .
- - Nice  What s the blue one towards the top called 
  - I believe it is a green long tentacle anemone
- - Hopefully they add libraries so we can have all of useful shortcut methods in a common location and do nt need to add them to every script manually .
  - That would be nice  I m pretty sure that s on their to-do list
- - That first one is maybe the most different and one of the most beautiful looking tattoos I have ever seen .
  - Thanks so much  It s definitely one of a kind . I have an amazing  talented artist who knows just how to bring my ideas to life .
- - Is nt woody known for liking bad music 
  - You should only worry if it s his sound cloud account .
- - Wow must ve missed that first rule you just made up .
  - Well  now you know for next time  You have a nice night .
- - Fun fact . the Ravens are undefeated while Jim Harbaugh is on either sideline
  - hopefully he has a full workload up in michigan this week and wont be able to attend tomorrow
- - It s fair if they actually get the facts in the article correct . Almost every single article about the game whether positive or negative  is riddled with errors .
  - I d like to see a positive article about the game that s riddled with errors . Do you have an example 
- - You are attractive  Can I date you 
  - Ha  well I seem to be consistently available ...
- - i can refer you if need be stil just shoot me a pm 
  - Yeah that would work  am only looking for people who want to level characters though with the triple exp
- - You know a thread is absolutely fucked when people come in and defend the institution of slavery .
  - No one is defending it edit . I scrolled down and stand corrected . Good god
- - I like some of these better than the original . Especially the Black Sabbath one .
  - Master of Puppets too . I d love a print of that .
- - What about Foxy  Is he not included in this theory  Or is he a child of Scott too 
  - I actually forgot about Foxy . I guess he could be a representation of the game going on sale . Scott only has two kids to my knowledge .
- - However by choosing a vegan diet  they are avoiding many far more dangerous risks to their health .
  - Uh  no  Reducing the meat in your diet is good ; eliminating all meat products is nt provably healthier . Humans eat meat for reasons other than taste .
- - Our company went under for several other reasons  none involving money .
  - Did nt the printer s place burn down 
  - Yeah that was one of the big reasons . There were others  more related to everyone s personal lives .
  - That s rough  mate . Hope things get better .
- - This is one of the most heartbreaking things I ve ever seen on the internet and that s saying something .
  - Well it s up there with that video of the guy who was threatening to kill those little kids in Syria or Lebanon or somewhere like that .
- - could be the PSU  if you have a spare one  try that
  - Unfortunately  I do nt have a spare . Is there anything else I could try

- - Yeah it s a respawn animation I believe . I m not sure if he would still be selling it though .
  - Yeah  I kinda figured it was a one time thing . Thanks for the input .
- - Really like that bomber  the color is awesome . Feel like black derbies would work a bit better here .
  - Indeed . Really great fit but the shoes are detracting from it somewhat .
- - Apparently people ca nt understand your sarcasm .
  - I for one do nt know who she is so I would not understand the ironic parts . That s how . Funny  now that I know though .

  - Ya  its been really slow lately . I d like to see some better price action .

  - Mine does . And I live in South Carolina too so who knows

  - An easy choice would be a white polo and white linen trousers . Both useable again .
- - have you watched football  It s preety much the same . people look for better players . I want to watch the best players in the world .
  - the thing is korean amateur player arent better then eu pro players
- - a mod that includes some interesting exploring quests like go find that lost glade  or sunken ship
  - basically neat places to explore and maybe find a unique treasure .
