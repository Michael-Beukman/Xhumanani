- - so do all the ibp players go to new teams now 
  - No . They stay the same team . They just get a different sponsor .
  - oh ok  so why does it matter 
  - I think because it s the introduction of bigger orgs for the NA scene .
- - I know the cowboys should win so we can play the panthers  but ick  the Lions got robbed on that last td run by the cowboys ...

- - Yep . That s how all smart flip cases work as well  such as my HTC One Dot View .
  - Have you noticed a mark on your screen from where the magnet in the case rests  Mine left a faint permanent round mark on my screen

- - More accurately  he died because he would nt go to the hospital  for obvious reasons .
  - He probably did nt want to talk about it  maybe because he was feeling a bit hoarse .

  - Odd  thats how everyone else feels about eagle fans
- - That on the whole  we re all going to grow up and be unremarkable .
  - I ll certainly be worthy of remarks .

  - I do nt see a reason we ca nt do both . An army of orc skeletons  yes that sounds nice and terrifying .
- - What made you decide not to be such a baby anymore 
  - It was nt my decision  unfortunately . I guess you could say I grew out of it .
- - Why are there so many iPhones with broken screens

- - I m sorry  but this is the best thing ever .
  - I m not . That was really cool watch 
- - I coulda sworn they said a month free . Maybe I heard wrong . I remember the ODST comment
  - You re right  we are getting a month of gold .
- - Lmao at these people asking for asiimovs  cause that s definitely going to happen
  - Yea  people are giving them away just like that  ez

- - Do you think it would work better if they ran it like MLG s CoD league  Or is it more of a money issue 
  - Happy  go lucky Ninja was bitching about the last tournament on stream all day the other day .
- - Come on people  we do nt need the same bitching about the refs that we had in the other game thread .
  - If they re bad they re bad . Just because they re continually bad does nt mean we should accept it .
- - All jokes aside these refs are too emotional to be reffing an NBA game .
  - People with that hair style usually are emotional
- - Ca nt you only play as Terran if you spawn in though 
  - Nope  I think they removed that restriction entirely  but even if they did nt  spawning bypasses all limitations .
- - My experience is that companies often change the blend and do nt tell us . Or the blend is the same  but the crop is different .
  - Crop changes all of the time . The blend is certainly the same  though .
- - No . AP garen has no AP scalings so you ca nt really get fed but i see your point
  - Lichbane gives you ap scaling  and his ult does magic damage so void staff helps .
  - I do nt think thats enough to carry tho
  - Of course it is nt viable . But technically if you got far enough head you could still wreck people with ap garen .
- - Kinda makes it look like an airplane hanger .
  - it does open . beautiful view of the skyline on a nice day

  - I thought of it  but I do nt doubt Sarah Silverman also thought of it .
