  - They re taping elbows now  Damn .
  - Too many people were passing their hands under their feet  so escalation was required .

  - Although I agree  it really is unfair to non east coast players especially those of EU west .
- - Do you have an extra thumbstick cover 
  - Just go ask for one at your shop

- - I havnt played MP but SP this is one of the worst CoD games yet  fuck the people who said it was an improvement to ghosts .

  - Hah  I actually watched the whole second one  And like a third of the first one 
- - You really should have told him that condoms exist .
  - I did . Friends did . Parents did . We all did . Repeatedly . He did nt listen .
- - It s not really that ironic . It s safe to assume that his show is the only reason the Enquirer conducted surveillance on him in the first place .
  - What would be ironic is if he was cheating on his wife with a minor .
- - Nice  so did your passenger die as well  Killfeed did nt say .

  - Aww muffin . Other people having fun really gets to you  huh

  - He gave up  Nonononono . He was forced to .
- - Could someone upload his lesson  I ca nt watch it .
  - It ll be on his youtube channel but theres a VOD link already somewhere in this thread
- - Doing a prograde burn like that the whole time would totally ruin his orbit path ...
  - Unless it s not prograde . It could be in a direction downward enough that the orbit stays relatively the same .
- - If you REALLY want to know ask a man . You do nt ask the tiger how to hunt it .
  - It s always good to get a different perspective . True the tiger does nt know how to hunt itself  but it does know what it wants .
- - Unfortunately I do nt have a Ninetails  but would you add me so I may get Sunkern  Sawsbuck and Quilladin .
  - Can I add you  I need all of those

  - Well . I ve been trying my luck here where I come from but it seems like they are more into manlier looking kinda muscled guys .
- - Where s the dude who said he would put shit on his chest lol
  - Fight did nt satisfy the hype  so now it s this .
- - You know they already make Half Baked as a froyo  right  Froyo is great because it has no lactose 
  - Yes I ca nt have it . Also  I am vegan but I want to advocate for the lactose free people like myself too 
- - I agree it is likely illegal  but a felony  Seems unlikely .
  - Ah  I did nt realize that was the part you were questioning . Whoops

  - It s not an uncommon Russian name actually .
- - I kind of hoped if Buffalo does nt get Mcdavid  it would be Winnipeg .
  - after seeing him and Petan at the WJC  I will join you in this pipe dream
- - Everyone knows he causes quite a commotion whereever he goes . He s the reason the smith s daughter is out so often .
  - It s probably why the blacksmith does nt like him .
- - That was nt the core of my argument and you know that .
  - The core of your argument was also stupid .
- - That s the kicker  he is on the lease . Things were okay last May and I thought it would help him feel more comfortable and stable .

- - I literally have no idea what your picture is . If you hate mobile users  continue to post image links from Facebook .
  - It s revenge for all the mobile links that get posted .
- - Fuck this noise ; Has to hit the table before landing in the cup for it to count .
  - House rules Anyway I m sure that calculating bounce trajectory would nt be that complicated to add to the algorithm . Might have to calibrate per ball though
- - I would nt prevent Chernobyl . That might severely impact the fall of the USSR and that probably would nt be good .

- - All drugs should be legalized and regulated .
  - Definitely not an unpopular opinion around these parts .

  - I would agree  and add that scope creep can be one of the largest risks if not actively managed .
- - Your day to day life would nt be different if the Pluto was made of chocolate . Would you not mind a a scifi plot built around that 
  - Not sure why you were down voted  I thought the points you made were valid .
- - So it s better to game the system as much as possible then .
  - If you want anything better than some silvers and a few shitty golds on your team  Yes .
- - I have friends who ve had that happen  too . After putting up with our periods for so long  you d think we d get a break 
  - As soon as I finish having a family  I m getting a Hysterectomy for that reason alone .

  - I was dragging and dropping the file into a Chrome browser window  which is what their instructions recommended .
- - So it s true then  I ve always heard people say that the home office controls the air but damn I never actually believed anyone .
  - Of course they do . There is no instore controls . The closest you can get is to have your market manager request a change in temperature .
- - maybe you have some underlying condition that saps your strength and energy . I wouldnt blame that on vaping .
  - i do actually  but with that being said the effects of nicotine can sometimes make me feel poisoned  and noticeably saps my strength for the duration of its effect
- - was nt sure if that bit was referring to the pathfinder group or the rogue trader group  so I figured I d ask .
  - It refers to both  current plan is that they switch off each saturday
- - Vivek should stop trying to be W s copycat and maybe he ll then be successful .
  - Yes but nothing wrong with learning from  and adapting it for the Kings . It s just that Boogie is the opposite of the Dubs  system .

  - I agree . He s tried to keep his cool and composure but after failing to get results  the dam had to break sometime .
  - The way the assistants continued on with practice I almost wonder if it was in some way premeditated .

- - Is it just me  or does Jury look a little rattled when he stands in front of Cerrone 
  - I thought the same thing . He looks concerned . As he should  cowboy is a beast 
- - I m confused what this comment has to do with this post .
  - you do nt have to be so anal about understanding every comment you read Kappa

  - It s pretty clear from that same said page that Italy disagrees with you .
- - Given that hullabaloo over the interview  I m not optimistic that we ll bravely stand up for free speech in the face of actual threats .

  - How do you know God has these

  - Not no effect  just not remotely comparable . Nor are they nearly as obviously bad calls .
- - Hmm  Try a different browser and device .
  - Ok . So it works on IE but i hate using IE . I am using google chrome atm .

  - I love Carlson but he looks he s stoned right now .
  - hes looked stoned for the past two years .
- - We re not talking about the NSA here  we re talking about the Daily Telegraph .

- - Where I live no matter what happens it is ALWAYS the drivers fault .
  - Well that s fucked then  honestly .
- - Here s a serious question . you okay  I mean  in terms of being bored 
  - yeah  go all good and go all bad

  - Yep . There is a list of reasons a mile long really .
- - Interesting thought that they could be trying to manipulate the temperature in order to gain support for the climate change hoax and the carbon tax cash grab .
  - easier to just alter the data and pay off the people who record the temps .
- - Do nt know if he is a brazilian or not  but that he is nt speaking portuguese I m sure of it
  - He s speaking Spanish . It s more clear on the original video .
- - Third  and it reminds me of Spectral Eyes and other psychedelic artists .
  - Psychedelic art is definitely the right category .
- - You could try the brass in the MIDI in Reaper  if it s cheesy maybe some effects to make it more real
  - That s a good idea  I did nt even think of that . By the way  I checked out your soundcloud and your guitar work is awesome .
- - We generalize statements about them because according to several opinion polls on attitudes in the Muslim world  they deserve it .

  - Seems like a good idea imo . Better than using local HDs .
- - So we are currently draw in the league with Man C 
  - Perfectly tied . Unless there s another goal in this game  we ll be level in every way going into FA Cup day .
- - Cm is garbage  I d run stock before I used that crap rom personally
  - Seriously  Every time I ve flashed it  there s always something wrong with it  I just want stock Android while stable  because I m tired of TouchWiz
- - I ve almost never heard the music you use before  but I pretty much always like it .
  - That was just what I happened to be listening to at the time  I did nt add the music in post . It actually synced up amazingly well .

  - Welcome to the human condition my friend  Weapons are in the third door to the left .

  - t you re saying you at least get a Pink Floyd pic to appear on your live tile 
  - Yeah  however it never comes up on the lock screen .

- - Love that topcoat  Where did you get it 
  - Thanks  It s from J Crew . I got it on sale last week  but I think it s now sold out .

- - When I paid OP s mom for sex .
  - You were paying for a world famous handjob .
- - Ok  Thank you for the info .
  - I agree with my Marine friend above . Increase your Federation standings by doing progression missions for them . You will find them in the Bulletin Boards of Federation stations .
- - because the DA is a gutless sack of shit . but you already knew that  did nt you  Did nt we all 
  - DAs do nt like charging cops  because then the cops wo nt work with the DA .
- - Glad you re finally figuring things out  even if it did take a while 
  - Yeah  most of the time it took was from complacency . Surprised the state of my condition did nt progress from my laziness .
- - Seven publications by the time you re on the market  Sweet baby jesus I am so screwed
  - I ve heard psych needs more pubs than other fields .

  - Opened it  saw Jerry Angelo in the headline  exited out . I do nt care what he thinks .
- - After evading being burned I check  could it be the dragon 
  - Dragons do nt throw Molotov cocktails . No  it was definitely bandits or similar such baddies .
  - I search them for valuables  like weapons  food  and loot .
  - You find a few pieces of gold and several guns .
  - I focus and attempt to look for plants with healing properties .
  - There are no plants  everything has been burned to the ground .

  - I hope you do nt have mice in your house .
- - Did you print with support material  At what angle does it print from  As displayed or the elbow 
  - It has a curved bottom so I had to use a raft to keep it from tipping over  but no other supper material  it printed from the wrist up .
- - I think he had another account on here already .
  - Yeah  it s a bunch of numbers as his user name
- - Is that his basket  Sure looks like it . Adorable 
  - yes  i put that basket there just for him . He loves it . He and our other cat constantly fight over who gets to sit in the window basket .
- - Note to self- if I have a nightmare again go here to soothe all woes
  - A friendly reminder . if I have a nightmare again go here to soothe all woes
- - Then you should type it as MB instead of Mb if you were clarifying from byte to bit .

  - For a little bit of context  we talk about makeup pretty much every day and the conversation went on for a few pages after that .
- - You needed to read their stories to feel bad about killing them  Priscilla is nt even hostile in any way .
  - I had no idea Sif was Artorias s pup though . Thought he was some random big wolf . i m an idiot
- - Replacing a fucking old cunt with a regular cunt .
  - this cunt is a much better manager than the old one
- - A Facebook friend of mine posted that it was deserved and expected because offensive and because of France banning the hijab  etc etc xenophobes blah blah .
  - I do nt think it was deserved but if you wan na have a nation of peace and freedom you kinda have to apply it to everyone
  - walk in to a bank tomorrow with a facemask on and tell me about how they are super accepting of your cultural freedoms .
  - a facemask is not the same as a niqab

- - He also plays clash of clans  so  explains everything
  - What  One ca nt clash between heavy squats 
- - The day she dies of heart failure  I hope it will be every hams wake-up call . No amount of make-up and photoshop can save your heart from busting .
  - Watch  she ll die in a car or plane crash or something and just turn into a martyr . Ugh .
- - Are you sure you were given it back at passport control or might you have left it at security  Maybe contact the airport s lost and found
  - Maybe  I ll do that  thanks .

- - Depends how we go in this transfer window I think . Changes need to be made and given time to adapt before I ll start calling for his head .
  - Im curious to see how many changes he is able to make
- - That southbound Brooklyn Bridge exit is the worst experience .
  - is it just me or does it look like its taking those cars straight hours to get off the exit
- - Because when I think sources to change someone s mind  I think Wikipedia .
  - Well its better than what you have provided .
