  - Looks like he was looking to me  and those cars were at a stop sign letting him cross .
- - I think anything wireless appears too cool to be true . Invisible information sent through the air  through trees and walls  It s like magic .
  - Think about the speed reduction in comparison to a direct connection via ethernet . Yes  you do nt have wires  but you also have slower speeds .
  - Slower speed but increased practical range . We can even communicate with other planets wirelessly  and do so every day .
  - Yes  I m not denying its benefits  I m just pointing out the trade-off .
- - Even if you did nt die there you would have gotten smashed by the Flagship . Shit s hard  man .

  - Yup  I was at a friends house .
- - I like how precisely you needed the crosshairs on the L
  - LOL  I was having a hard time .
- - Have had cats for my entire sentient existence -- not one cat has ever done this in my presence . I am not optimistic about this cat s future .

  - Or get ultimo but land your eldest son  who will likely then start a faction for primo .
- - Written by someone who s never worked retail .
  - Haha  actually that industry became it too close for comfort . Thanks

  - Fighting the good fight never gets any acknowledgement .
- - How many basketball wives are reality hoes  Most of them are nt .
  - I know  was being semi srs  but she does nt seem as generic as most basketball wives in terms of looks etc
- - Does that mean snowmen hate black ice 
  - Black ice is known to be dangerous . Statistics do nt lie .
- - what the shit are you talking about 
  - ODST is free for this who bought MCC early .
- - I have to know is that your real hair  extentions or a really good quality wig . From the pictures it was quite seamless .
  - Thank you  It s a full wig .
- - Here s a quick dose of wisdom to avoid ridicule in the future . Stop calling them quests . Quickly .
  - haha I noticed that as soon as I posted it  but I also assumed no one would really care . Guess I was wrong  thank you .
- - If he comes back  have him check the voltages .
  - I will do that too  thanks everyone for the help 
- - Hollow points are the ones that do massive internal damage  right  Is this a hollow point 
  - Not sure they make hollow points in this caliber . The energy in this round and considering the target  it really makes no difference
- - Noise  where would we be without you  A tree falls  a cabin is made ...
  - How dare you invoke Abraham Lincoln  He was our quietest president .
- - Still counts . If you go to our wiki it describes the rule in full  and we generally do nt allow diagrams or info graphics .
  - Thanks  is that the score for all subs  what s the reasoning 
- - And before we know it  Falcao s tips and tricks turn Valencia into a deadly area poacher and a somewhat good winger .
  - If this turns out to be true  all the more reasons for Falcao to be a permanent player .
- - Yes the metro version  Forgot about its awesome and is really good at split screening .
  - Metro version is awesome casual browsing in bed or walking about the house . Need to give the split screening a try .
- - If you do nt want people to comment on your appearance than do nt post about other peoples appearances and do nt post pictures of yourself .
  - You equate my appearance to a neo nazi and I m the unreasonable one  You ve got to be kidding .
- - I do nt care about the music  it s the video .
  - I do nt think you get Dillon Francis . Half the visuals on his tour right now are dancing sticks of butter and cats .
- - I think the weights are exactly the same or very close ftr
  - Yeah that seemed weird  though that does nt have to do with the first video being a much easier lift then the second .
- - Thunder . Everybody seems to brush it off like it s nothing  but it scares the crap out of me .
  - You d get on well with my dog .
- - She sounds super slutty  you were better off not sleeping with her .
  - No way can you determine if she was slutty from one story of an attempted sexual encounter .
- - Thin privilege is actually looking pregnant and not just fat as hell .
  - That s pretty much average weight privilege actually lol
- - I just pretend that Qui-Gon was a shitty Jedi that did nt properly understand the force ... Which is why he almost caused the destruction of the Jedi order .

- - who the fuck plays jenga where you can use tools 
  - I would have made an exception if the person wanted to go for the only one the bottom . The chance of actually getting it is really low I d imagine .
- - Steam group would be awesome . Good way to get feedback easily too .
  - It is done . Check OP or the parent comment for a link .
- - Except the song is not about homosexuality . Your friend  as well as the OP  are wrong .
  - Not exclusively ... but it does deal with the freedom of sexual orientation and how the church is restrictive and back stabbing when it comes to that .
- - Get the hair put of your face  it makes you look younger .
  - Looking younger is nt always a bad thing . D
- - Holy shit  that s not a stuffed animal .
  - I seriously thought it was a stuffed animal also 
- - We remind out PAU friends to remain out of the Americas as we have remained out of Africa .
  - As of now the Task Force is in international waters and will remain there .
- - Yeah  it s amazing how many times Korra ditched Naga . You never saw Aang do that .
  - Hell he fucked over a whole nation to find Appa
- - If you think teachers have any say over this at all  you re an idiot .
  - Well  that s the real problem . the people making all the decisions never had any interest in teaching .
- - So what did it taste like  I m asking to gain some insight as to why my dog goes nuts for the stray cat shit around my house .
  - It tastes a lot like it smells but it has a firm  meaty texture that is fulfilling .
- - I almost started looking into that school when UF was discussing cutting down the Computer Science department . However  they only took away some funding and I stayed put .
  - could you explain what they actually did in regards to computer science . I ve heard a bunch of different things 
- - Oh . It s you ... It s been a long time . How have you been 
  - I ve been really busy being dead . You know  after you murdered me 
- - And you get your own squad and you get your own squad everyone gets their own squad . D
  - I want you all to look under your seats ... IT S YOUR OWN SQUAD

  - All british battle rappers YEAH I WENT THERE
- - Art at it s finest . Thanks 
  - No problem  it is fun . Jumpscare is next  so stay tuned 
- - Timid  definitely . Volcarona is a special sweeper . None of its egg moves are all that good on it - even Morning Sun is questionable .
  - I was leaning towards timid  and so timid it is 
- - i got approved for payment so others dont need to worry about getting ripped off
  - Cool thanks for responding  Just confusing to me and felt to ask . You  re a braver traveler than I . Thanks and you to cyanide .
- - Wait so are you supposed to fuck those things 
  - Stop for a moment  and decide if you really want that question answered .
- - Tricky night tonight for DFS . One player swap literally makes all the difference .
  - pretty much the case every night ... Everyone is picking from the same pool  every night .
- - Make this your opportunity to connect then . You really both might benefit from talking about your interest in this girl
  - So  would it be a good idea to write a letter and talk after  Or talk right away 
  - You know your parents best so go with your gut . I just know from experience thAt talking in person is usually best
  - Personally  I d rather write a nice letter . But I think talking would be a better option for dealing with them .
- - Yup . Been going to Boba net when I have time off because their net and specs are much better than mine 
  - lol maybe i ve met you in there  or we ve crossed paths in there before  lol
- - huh  only knew that as a WoW movie . Funny to see the real source .
  - I saw it as a Guild Wars clip first - shows how many people made their own version using the song .
- - care to talk about your treatment of the native Americans then 
  - Yours as well . Unlike British people  I do nt tend to sweep past atrocities under the rug . Colonial subjugation of the past still exerts its effects TODAY
- - Considering that you could resell just one or two of those figures and make all that money back  and then some ... Does nt seem so bad .
  - I could get behind that sentiment  but I m not really into selling stuff
- - I m going to make one from the saved up locks of hair belonging to each one of my exes . And will refer to the brushes by name .
  - umm ur stealing ideas from Tom Ford  reported
- - that is unreal . what an awesome present
  - Right  It s fantastic . I m framing it and putting it up on my wall in my dorm once break is over .
- - Cards against humanity is a stupid game that takes the originality away from coming up with jokes . It just feels like the same shit recycled over and over .
  - It s really is like chasing the dragon each subsequent time you play it .
- - That is nt true  a good CEO can come from anywhere . In fact sometimes an outsider is exactly what is needed .
  - I was nt talking about a CEO .
- - Rocky Mountain Animal Defense  What in gods name could they need a video card for 
  - Royal Mounties Airborne Defense  Like  a moose with propeller antlers 
- - maybe because we have enough lame ass zombie killing games already
  - Oop  surprise hater in the mix .
- - I know almost nothing about cricket . Why are the guys throwing the ball up in the air as soon as they catch it 
  - Celebrating their amazing catches  that s all
- - It s really sad that this is how the NHL is now
  - Is it  I m not so sure that it is .
- - I do nt really think he throws it deep too much ... you re exaggerating
  - If anyone took my first post seriously that s their problem . I figured linking my drunk comments from last night s game would be a good indicator
- - Three point guards  but PJ runs the break . Makes sense .
  - Dragic was wide open too . I hope Tucker saw him at least before turning it over .
- - wow  pretty cool that you can access the internet while you re living in the past
  - Someone is butthurt about a shitty record .
- - Fair point . But someone has to keep the hate off the roads .
  - It does seem to pile up out there ...
- - Also interesting  the cycles are enforced by erectile tissue in your nose  similar to that that enforces boners .
  - Which is how Afrin works . Kills the nose boner .
- - That jay said the pay phone was outside and drew a map
  - Thanks . I sort of remembers that now .
- - Would nt the armistice with North Korea win 
  - An armistice is one step above a cease fire  so technically no .
- - What I meant was that he did nt take a WR at all  as in not in the entire draft . Not just talking about the first round .
  - Grabbed  Hawkins and Austin in free agency and Gabriel as a udfa . Must have known he could build without the draft .
- - That is not at all what I expected .
  - Which is what I expected most people to say and therefore not like the comic . Oh how wrong I was proved  and that is wonderful 
- - Out of curiosity to those who have these  do you adjust them every time a team changes  weekly  etc . 
  - I was going to adjust every Sunday night during the game .
- - Is the air thin up there on your high horse 
  - Is that hard to realize that sarcasm was implied 
- - I agree  he has an unnatural movement to him  like he s riding a segway everywhere .
  - Try playing Lina  it s like her breasts are guiding her .
- - The terrorists want western peoples to attack Muslims in order to radicalize more of them . So  yeah  it s working .
  - All they wanted was to increase hate among people  which they have done successfully .
- - It was a rookie mistake . I thought it was a temporary dip .
  - Ouch . Sorry to hear that  but we all do it sometimes .
- - Ahh link only  Or full on private 
  - Not sure  never uploaded to YT so I ll have to determine that as well too it seems .
- - of what you said . Seriously . stop wasting your time .
  - Sorry to have bothered you . Cheers .
- - Pull up your store and search for the sweeper so it comes up next time you back as a reminder .
  - But that would require me to not forget it in the first place
- - I agree and disagree with you if that makes any sense .
  - I ll take it . I m surprised by the overwhelmingly positive responses to be honest
- - I dont mean i like that i just dont like how it fucks up every other card except pendulum cards
  - The only good pendulum deck is Qliphort . Pendulums are barely relevant .
- - also why the fuck is it in pics
  - Because OPs trying to pass it off a pic he took
- - What I hate the most is that she thinks she looks good .
  - I know  Howard should have been on her like she was Nicole Bass ...
- - Leonard Williams and it s not close .
  - i agree . amari is a good receiver  but history has shown value at WR exists later in the draft .
- - Dank je vel  That s the only Dutch I know  I feel compelled to say it .
  - It s Dank je wel  fwiw .
- - I m of the belief gally has been removed from xurs loot table . If everyone had gally  the game would be broken .
  - Same goes for Ice Breaker I think .
- - Nah  I think this one is actually pretty good  minus the caption .
  - A lot of the posts on here are only applicable because of a caption .
- - GOI does not consider it to be a terrorist organization . Do you know why 
  - I dont know why  all I know is they have been involved in terrorist activities which makes them terrorists .
- - I do nt think that was Bee s first tweet  she deleted her others when she left the internet .
  - Yea I think there s others like that too
- - Realistic world generation with flying slime islands  That s not very realistic
  - You ve never been that far south I take it .
- - True my mom goes fucking apeshit for mushrooms
  - As a man who regularly goes apeshit for mushrooms I have to say you have an awesome mom
- - Actually this happens rather frequently . They shut the ride down and replace all of the water .
  - So  her husbands final resting place was the filter at the water treatment plant .
- - Or you could do what I do  and lie for gold if you really wanted it and see what you get .
  - This guy right here finally speaks the truth . But you forgot to finish your sentence with Roll Tide ...
- - Epic . angry  and lightswitch   WTF Bungie 
  - I know man . They hate us .
- - You have inspired me . Would this me the NATO Strap Co 
  - Yep . Purchased from the link posted here a few days back .

  - Sorry  I m seeing this a day later . I went to Delaware .
- - Noxious clip feels almost impossible . Incredible bad luck .
  - Did I see it wrong or did he have a whirling blades in his hand he could have used 
  - Yeah  I had it but it was a god awful play if I hoped to stay in the game and maybe win .
  - Of course I see your comment right after I turn on Ameno on youtube .
- - If this game spawns a competitive scene  i ll definitely join it .
  - If it does I honestly would too .
- - Holy balls can you call that foul any later 
  - Refs practically called it during the TV timeout .
- - So you buy the skin and then set the time back or is it the other way round 
  - you set the date and then buy that s what logic suggests ; have nt tested it though
- - Good to know . How do you store it 
  - In plastic bottles with as little air contact as possible .
- - You know that you wo nt get one if you ve gotten chat restricted  and then you re telling us that you ve been chat restricted . Are you high 
  - im still on chat restriction and i still received UFO Corki .
- - Klay s deal is for next season  not this season .
  - Oh  doh  Of course it is . Thanks 
- - I can get online now  can you 
  - Sorry  I just woke up . Can you still 
- - If you revised this  in sure you d be front page tomorrow
  - crazy what the high mind can think of 
- - I wish the chat was less janky  it s super slow to choose existing messages and the cluster of people you messaged or who messaged you is just an eyesore
  - Chat is on the.net variant i believe .
- - I love the idea  but you really need a long term solution . How are they getting in  Fix that .
  - That s what I m gon na end up doing . I only just tried this last night .
  - There s a hole somewhere ... find it  fix it and forget it .
  - I did end up finding it  Have nt caught any more since plugging it up .
- - Hmm is that an old word or something  Google came up with that definition though the word does nt seem to be in some dictionaries .
  - It s not archaic  I do nt know why it would nt appear in a dictionary . Maybe because it s a compound word 
  - The point is ... how s your mom doing 
  - Well  she s probably drunk right now  but she does nt do buttsex .
- - Szcesny was great against west ham  so this seems a little bit rash
  - No it does nt . World class keepers should be error free  not casually great . Szcesny is clearly not .
- - Please  no . I had my fill of shitty impromptu renditions of Bohemian Rhapsody in high school  thanks .
  - You should know once it starts ... anyway the wind blows
- - Netflix just keeps getting better and better .
  - I think you missed one or two subs when posting this ...
  - Dude  I think he was calling you a dog . Or a shitlord  I really ca nt make sense of it either .
  - Maybe he was trying a little too hard 
- - Came for the Comcast complaint  stayed for the cat picture .
  - She is something to behold aint she  She s named Arwen because of her beauty
- - TOO BAD YOU GUYS WENT ALL NANCY AND GOT A HEATED FIELD . I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE ICE SHOW
  - SAYS THE TEAM THAT PLAYS IN A DOME
- - No . How far away the events are depends on the observer . There is no such thing as a universal  exact time something happens .
  - I think you need to back that up with some references . It sounds like you ve misinterpreted somebody s analogies .
- - Can we pass a law that bans lawmakers that make bad laws from making more laws 
  - We already did  we call it the Constitution
- - What was your role in the video you guys made 
  - He owns the helicopter and set the whole thing up
- - Tinker ca nt win anything  let alone something where people are playing seriously
  - Honestly they re laughable atm but with a couple changes they could be big . Sing has expressed his frustrations with the current roster .
