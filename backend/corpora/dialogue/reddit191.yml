  - If your talking about my company or service companies in general  we are not a part of the refining .
- - That was a lucky first goal  did nt realise it deflected off a Yeovil player to get to Herrera . Fletcher s poor passing actually got us a goal ...
  - Good passing could have got us two .

  - But you do nt  first world problemer .
- - pretty sure that was the throwing knife that killed him .
  - It was the sniper . Its why he got a marksman bonus .
- - It was fucked up . Something about black men ruining the beauty of black people by sticking their dicks in white women .

  - do they work as a combo aswell  Or would it be too much 
- - Hopefully most offices will follow suit . Public transit will be a nightmare . The world wo nt end if people get a Wednesday off 
  - Why would public transit be terrible  It s just cold there s no storm .
- - I would do that too if I had to single support coz of furion jungle . D Srsly though  he gets his punishment in form of low priority .
  - That was a low priority game  you can troll all you like in low priority because reports against you do nt count while you re in there .
- - There is a severe lack of the word cunt in this thread .
  - Not if you speak Afrikaans  mate .
- - That s true  explaining all motion with this would make it meaningless . Also  I commend you for actually using two spaces after every sentence .
  - It may now be purely an aesthetic thing  but I like it .
- - You can download it  just as long as you do nt execute it . If you did nt run it  then you re fine .
  - Oh ok  fantastic . Is there a way to find the file in my computer 
- - I do nt get it  other than as a spare what s the use of keeping them  Mind you  I run my tires until they re practically bald
  - OP s seem to have a fair amount of tread on them . Used all terrain and mud terrain tires are nt very hard to sell on craigslist or similar websites
- - He s damn lucky that thing was nt pointing at the cop ... he d be dead .
  - Nah it seems to be a Dutch cop  and they rarely use the gun they carry with them .

- - The darkest movie I ever saw is Martyrs .
  - The original French version was superb  The American version was kind of watered down .
- - I regret all negative things I ve ever said about Fickell . And there are a lot of them .
  - I do nt know if i d go that far ...
- - that being said  dancing on a rolly office chair is a great way to risk killing yourself ...
  - Its also a great way to start a mosh pit .
- - But mosaic ca nt handle dissimilar melting temps like for support material .
  - that would be an interesting dynamic then one nozzle for multi coloured stuff  second nozzle for support
- - Data mining at North West University hopefully stats and IT is fun . P

  - The new definition of being an enabler . imprisoning only guilty people .
- - Hellz yeah . Did it keep the petals from popping 
  - Seemed to . Was a last minute thought to do it  glad I did .
- - Well I found this list and randomly scrolled down and saw Asura then promptly watched it . Jesus christ that movie is amazing .
  - same here  caught my eye instantly . makes me sad that it doesnt seem to have a lot of attention because i loved just about every aspect of it
- - Which is exactly why it s not newsworthy .
  - Ha ha  WE are the ones making this newsworthy right now  just by talking about it 
  - I m mostly referring to the title of the article  which is obvious click bait .
  - Fair enough . I just got this weird introspective moment I wanted to share .
- - Which arm do you have on the AR  That will help determine what cartridge would play well .
  - It s the AR arm that came on it .
- - My cat has gotten in the habit of peeing in the elements on my stove ... There is nothing worse than the smell of burnt cat piss ...
  - A steady diet of dog food may cause blindness in your cat - it lacks taurine . Related page . Cat Munchies
- - There are other good companies besides Honda . Do nt limit yourself because of brand loyalty .
  - I really do love Hondas . I do nt enjoy driving any other brand . Though  I would definitely buy a Mercedes if I can afford one someday .
- - Any idea or word how this leak happen . Or who leaked it . I do nt think I ve ever seen leaked DLC gameplay before .
  - It actually happens quite often  although it usually does nt leak this soon .
- - you sir are the reason I will never visit this sub again
  - Honored . Unsub and close the door on your way out . kthxbye .
- - That s so pathetic . To use against who  Like get your own fucking people educated and out poverty before you buy robotic tanks for your army .
  - Russians are actually quite educated and poverty is nt that high . Their standard if living is just a bit worse than the west .
- - Why not rage blade for Lushen  Or is fatal blade just better 
  - Read the stuff before the guide . I left stuff there for a reason
- - Torres was nt good at this match  he lost some balls and was caught for offsides ...
  - It was Real Madrid and his first Match in a new Team . Besides he is a striker he has to take risks .
- - Blackburn are owned by a chicken company and attempted to sign Ronaldinho
  - Last time i heard there were rumours about beckham too . They also introduces indians to majestic chicken nuggets
- - Maybe the case and motherboard  Those are more minor things .
  - Okay  well thank you for helping me .
- - Another visit to the Amex . Hope it s more comfortable than the last .
  - Ulloa with a debut English football header last time . Should have seen it coming .
- - It s not my fault  it s the radiation .
  - Okay  make nice  give us the ray gun .
- - One call does nt end a game . Bad offense does though .
  - It was nt one call . It was GIVING the opposing team seven free points .
- - Of course you wo nt  the bottom one is asian  unless you found a way to control your kids gene .
  - how do you know the guy who made this is nt asian  oh right because this post is so white I have the sudden urge to play croquet
- - Your profile is set too private  you can change it in the settings
  - I updated it  Thanks for the heads up 
- - DC did nt get a takedown  because he did nt control Jones on the ground afterwards . That s the official definition .
  - Looked like a guard pull anyway . And i was rooting for dc . Edit . I m retarded and forgot the Slam .
- - Thanks for the actual explanation  So now I know I had a seinfeld moment myself when I couldnt date a girl because I didnt like her name .
  - Exactly  There are actually even more outlandish examples I just could nt remember and I m on my phone .
- - We will be using you for our exchanges always moving forward . Nice work .
  - They took profit then backtracked . Praise the people who stood up before the scam fell apart .
- - Ya but the thing is how are the doom shrooms etc walk  the plants hero can but the others ca nt
  - Maybe there can be a lot of potted plants everywhere and they could keep spawning
- - Fine for not wearing flip flops  My team used to fine people for wearing flip flops to games .
  - Should probably wear boots to games instead .
- - Just coming into the game  what d I miss 
  - Not the Cowboys  they have nt showed up yet .
- - Why were there so many caster minions and no melees  Just the way the waves push 
  - Melees will always die first so by the time a self pushing lane reaches a tower its gon na be mostly casters  so yes .
- - OMG that rune is a monster  I would definitely put it one of your support monsters that wants the def and hp .
  - Indeed  that is true  I only wish it was swift or something XD . Thank you mate .
- - except it s not  the ENTIRE POINT of this game is to be REALISTIC
  - For YOU that s the point ... you play the game the way that makes you happy . And I will do the same .
- - Terrence Malick . I get it but I just do nt think it s that amazing ...
  - It s a pretty navel gazing fest for me . Which is nt bad but  you know  it s get a bit long in tooth after a while
- - Why the hell was nt this game on TV 
  - Because Phoenix and Minnesota have much larger markets and playoff implications than Atlanta and Memphis . Obviously .
- - I feel bad for him . Just utterly defeated at the end .
  - I m not sure he was feeling anything at that particular moment . I do nt think him tipping over was an emotional response .
- - Get the green and pink ones  Make green Link and pink Zelda . D
  - This sounds amazing definitely will do this when I get new colors 
- - I m not a troll . Has anyone considered that maybe my name is a reference to the fact that I just really like the Linux OS 
  - or because fedoras are also really cool 
- - They used to have a space program . Now they have Adobe Illustrator .
  - Yep  the government probably did nt even fund that .
- - I registered just before I posted this .
  - Thank you . Your post is all set . Good luck . . D
- - Five bucks for one  Has to cost under ten cents to make .
  - And a pair of Nikes costs just pennies to make .
- - And they didnt think once to check it out 
  - Of course not . It s creepy .
- - yes ... mails are nice but have you tried following procedure and create a helpdesk ticket 
  - But creating a ticket takes so much time and effort  it s just easier to get the Boss involved . That way you know it will get done .
- - Call an electrician . There s something strange at play  and no one but an electrician looking at the issue can say for certain .
  - As not an electrician  I could look at the issue and say for certain .
- - As irrelevant as that was  I absolutely love it 
  - Well they did say post anything . Lol .
- - Because they are trying to say the lie enough that they might believe it . Also fatties are not very bright . Side note . how do I get certified 
  - Message the mods a pic with your username . Does nt have to show your face
- - You are all sex offenders for looking at her private photo that someone just happened to take in public 
  - Careful - you ll cut us all with your edge
- - Why would nt you trust the mods  You can remain anonymous and still verify at least your Woodlawn attendance . I do nt get it .
  - I just do nt . I can verify I went to woodlawn via questions regarding the school .
  - You realize that it makes your post seem like trolling  right  Not trying to be a jerk  but it raises questions .
  - I completely understand and have no problem if people disregard it .
- - I had my doubts about Peter Capaldi but he is golden . Give it another go 
  - Capaldi is nt the problem  It s Moffat s piss poor writing that I take issue with 
- - could there be aliens on the other side 
  - There could be aliens much closer and we would nt know .
- - Press up  then R  then c-stick up to buffer a jump and escape to the top platform .
  - Imo the most reasonable option . Puff could bait out getup attack with a full jump or waveland on so the best thing to do is GTFO .
- - Bring up Corrado and send Sbisa to the box to watch how it s done . Honestly so tired of his shit .
  - Corrado is already up . He s in the stands as a scratch .
- - Could you mount that PSU on the bottom 
  - Old cases only have the PSU entrance on the top . In the bottom there are only the PCI holes .
- - You mean like mailing a knife to a guy s house with a note to kill himself 
  - Or swatting people who criticize you to try and get them killed by the police 
- - All I know is that the movie will be directed by Michael Bay .
  - Totally forgot about him . Yes  this needs to be a movie directed by him .
- - It s quite clear that you just like to complain . And no  I do nt have a dog in this fight .
  - That s why I started this thread . To complain .
- - Tapirs have prehensile penises ... I ll let you google that yourself tho ...
  - Somehow I already knew that . Further proof that the internet has ruined me .
- - Not in the service industry  but my home hospital teacher used to always drink hot water . Not tea . Just boiling hot water . It was gross .
  - I drink hot water  especially in the winter . It s pretty common in many Asian countries .
- - It s possible to be both intelligent and an ignorant  racist piece of shit . Intelligence is nt a major factor here tbh .
  - Not really . Intelligence lends itself towards eradicating ignorance . There is a difference between intelligence and wisdom  but they compliment one another .
- - oh . so that s the source .
  - You should watch the whole video . It s pretty amusing .
- - My flair did nt give it away 
  - They re pretty light on my screen  that would have done it though . Nevertheless  it would still amount to a sarcasm check .
- - Sure  there s probably a bit of that too . It s not exclusive to right wing media though  that s common to all media .
  - Except the right wing has a disproportionate ownership of the media .
- - That is really a shame on that Indian Head Half Eagle . Those things command a nice premium even in average circulated condition .
  - So I should ask him to hold any indian heads he gets  More importantly  should I buy the one I saw today 
- - The gas does nt ignite at all  Igniter going bad 
  - Maybe . Is the igniter the coil thing that gets red hot or is there a spark 
- - Yes yes yes this . Hagrid would nt hold it in stoically . He s just not that person .
  - He was under the imperious curse at that time . It s possible the curse caused the downplay in his behaviour 
- - I think Steam has a feature that does this . Never used it though .
  - I ll give it a spin . Thanks 
- - Its probably gone wrong  DFU mode and restore it .
  - Note that you will lose any data that was nt backed up .
- - A vet . Maybe medication prescribed from said vet . A thunder shirt . This is providing none of the other suggestions work .
  - I m curious about Thunder shirts . Have you had success with them  Maddie is much calmer in normal sweaters and a thunder shirt may be something she would happily use
- - pick rumble  he counters himself with silence .
  - Rumble  overheat is nt a true silence though  since he can use his summoner spells .
- - So you re assuming he has a choice whether or not the things he designed and tested were built by slaves 
  - My point is that he did nt care  and did nt care who his rockets killed ... so long as the Nazis picked up the tab .
- - It s ok  you ll get your chance when he s old and frail and still have the authority complex .
  - What authority complex  Are you referring to parenthood 
- - nobody plays him cuz hes a garbage champ
  - Everyone is entitled to thier opinion no matter how wrong it is . . D
- - so i can get a pet fox now is what you are saying  right 
  - Russian study  IIRC . Not available for pets yet if ever AFAIK .
- - Is Butler usually this bad  or is the weather effecting his punts 
  - He s usually this bad  I m just happy he s not usually his bad on our team anymore .
- - Wow FSU has no chance against that quick play calling .
  - Couldnt even get their guys off the field in time .
- - I only played as Ellen  and I dont remember the game having motion controls that everyone seems to be mention  but it was awhile since I last played .
  - When you pull out the spirits  you have to tug  shake or rotate the controller .
- - So was he looking at his bench for a signal on when to pass exactly or could he tell when he should have from the corner of his eye 
  - I think it s the latter -- pretty much as soon as the cutter leaves his peripheral vision it s time to pass  from what it looks like .
- - Hunters are nt underrated we are the most popular character race
  - We just do nt talk about it as much 
- - I have  but not consistently . I sometimes listen to podcasts in German to keep up my language skills .
  - which ones  I would like to improve my German skills as well .
- - two dudes come in with a crowbar and bat in a tiny bathroom while he s in the tub . Basically beat the hell out of each other
  - Ah  crowbar and a bat in a very tiny room probably would nt be the best choice of weapon .
- - This lights and that music every time they get a PP is so obnoxious  damn .
  - IKR Jesus give a person who s vulnerable to that a seizure why do nt you .
- - Thanks for doing this Achtung  I always get excited when I see you ve made a new album .
  - Glad to make them for you  I find the FPH comments sections very entertaining to read .
- - What is the cigarette situation on an oil rig  If you re a smoker  I assume it s a complete no go what so ever 
  - You can smoke in designated areas on rigs
- - Hi Scott - Do you think there are enough podcasts in the world now  Like have we hit saturation point yet  Or no .
  - are there enough tv shows  Or movies  Probably .
- - I have no fucking idea what you are saying .
  - TL ; DR ... Cheater should nt be able to get free wins and boost his friends . Give up one of your games to deter cheaters ...
- - Their riffing style on that album comes almost directly from Celtic frost and hell hammer . If you re not familiar with them  you should definitely check them out too
  - Will do  I ve heard the names frequently but have nt ever listened to them
- - is nt there a UK version too 
  - Yeah I believe the US version is based on the UK version . Never seen the UK version though .
- - It looks awfully warm in there guys . Would you mind letting me in for a cuddle 
  - I promise not to claw your face off  too much .
- - He is falling in the last few years to avoid stepping awkwardly with his ankles .
  - Yes he has  and he has also done it to get foul calls .
- - I totally do this . Now I feel bad .
  - You should . What the hell do you think happens to them 
- - Except the decision on when to sue here does nt really change anything as far as the judgment is concerned .
  - True what it changes is how much they can convince Winston to settle for .
  - Winston s not named in the suit . He ca nt settle at all .
  - We were nt talking about this suit . We were talking about a potential future civil suit .
- - Yet these terrorists still managed to obtain weapons and carry out their massacre in a country with stricter gun control laws . Curious .
  - NRA is pretty happy at the move by terrorists to guns from bombs and IUD s . They ve marketed to terrorists pretty heavily and it s paid off .
- - No interview with carmelo  He s been playing with them the longest .
  - He probably was nt in the locker room since he did nt play that night
- - How did she not see that coming 
  - Well it s not like they saw it coming either .
- - It s a bug with RTG . You ll just lose the cards you use to train them with .
  - Ok thanks . At first I was thinking  have I never known about this 
- - I did . It s a funny deliberate misinterpretation of the question playing off of stereotypes .
  - It s an unfunny cheap shot that gave the all clear to the latent misogyny that followed it .
- - What a beautiful place . I really hope the campaign succeeds  we ca nt let these short-sighted  money grabbing twats take our wonderful heritage . Good luck 
  - Yep  I d love doing laps in here
- - I wonder if any of the Oculus employees participated in the survey
  - Wow  that is possible if only there was some identifying factor too see .
- - I second the second floor stacks . It is one of my favorite places on earth . So quiet .
  - The second floor stacks  Sounds like an adventure 
- - linux and mac os are finished now 
  - Because microsoft finally implemented a feature they had decades ago 
- - So  we ve just given up on having titles mean anything 
  - If you re familiar with the series and how this game came to be  it actually makes a lot of sense .
- - The VoG crowd did shrink for a while but the numbers have been trending back up lately .
  - Still nowhere near pre-DLC though ... It s a shame bc it s such a huge piece of quality content in a game that most people would agree needs more .
- - And it never occurred to him to do anything about that 
  - Different times . I know that guys these days pluck and shape and tan and exercise and things but back then you just had to not stink too bad .
- - This is the most depressing thing I ve read all day . Feels all over the place .
  - It s been a long time since I ve had feelz and realz .
- - I do nt think there is any game like it yet but I remember reading that the devs were trying to port it to android
  - I d buy it  in an instant . It looks like it would port fairly well  too .
- - Where the FUCK is the incidental on that play
  - its Ben they never call penalties against him
- - It still bends my brain that luke skywalker is the joker . Seeing Mark Hamill s face and hearing the Joker laugh is just ... I ca nt reconcile the two .
  - I ca nt imagine him as Luke Skywalker any more  only as The Joker
- - I would go with some nerite snails instead of an algae eater .
  - I ll look into them  thanks 
- - It s because those items have a higher alch value so they protect over .
  - yes but howcome when i went go get my items back i didnt get the visage  it was in my inventory before i died
- - I do like apartment therapy . It s relatively neutral in terms of design advice and you can pore through pictures of your preferred design style .
  - Second apartment therapy . The slideshows are interesting and you can just flick through a bunch to see various styles and what grabs you
- - What s the square root of OP s mom 
  - Devide the legs and you find your answer
- - Let s hope this is really over .
  - Not quite . One suspect got away in the confusion .
- - Only problem with Beckmans is that they come in D width only . Probably not ideal since he said he has wide feet .
  - ah  i missed that . stupid wide feet is the exact same reason i do nt own red wings  too .
- - Peanut Butter toast crunch is the only one worthwhile .
  - Peanut Butter Cap n Crunch is excellent too . Sadly  it does nt sell where I live . Only available in the States or back east .
- - Yeah . I mixed you up with the guy below I sent it to you thinking I sent it to him Then I started searching for yours and I only found his
  - LOL ... Either way it worked for all of us  thanks for the support and for the wonderful Poke . . D
- - Entendido y te lo agradezco  porque yo te leo con suma atencin y me gusta lo que escribes . Un abrazo
  - A tu entera disposicin  si cabe ms 
- - Those spinning arrows are excellent  can they stay a permanent feature 
  - Think it would get annoying if we kept it permanently  still pretty funny though
- - It s always good when they shoot the grenade right when you throw it .
  - This happens too many times on confluxes in VoG hard mode ... It s seriously a contender for my most common way of dying there .
- - I am so pumped for this and I am sure it will great . However  I am little skeptical about the game  hope it turns out great too .
  - After I saw the trailer for Fury Road I completely forgot Avalanche Studios were making a game .
- - Yea  because France has nt had any issues with extremists or Islamic Sharia seekers .
  - They certainly did today . Like I said  there are a handful of troublemakers among the five million perfectly normal people .
- - What country are you in  What country are you from 
  - Thank you for you all for your replies . I am in Japan and from The US
- - I see you want to play armchair researcher and tell personal stories . That s enough of this .
  - Uh no it s . obvious human interaction researcher .
- - It maybe because of that but newer versions are paid
  - hey fire just installed again still free nothing about paying .
- - Jese has lost every single battle down the sideline .
  - He tried to go down the line and lost everytime . He went inside once and got a cross which we almost scored .
- - What kind of sample are you keeping  I d do the same thing if I could afford it but I wo nt ever be able too .
  - I have some hair and saliva  and I also have a tooth she lost .
  - How do you store it  I really wish I would have thought about it before we got him neutered .
  - I ve got all of them frozen . Hair and nails should retain a good amount of the DNA  so you could do that .
  - Alright buddy  thanks so much . Hopefully it doest come to this for either of us for a very long time .
  - Let s hope not . And keys hope a solution presents itself before it does happen .
- - Hahahahaha thanks man  but I highly doubt that s happening
  - Seahawks are going to win . LOB 
- - Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo  I just finished this show so I m still in that post show gushing period but it was really really good 
  - I intended to watch that when it first aired but never got around to it - thanks for the reminder 
- - I swear ... I must one of the few who actually like doing the thaumcraft research ...
  - I do like the idea of the research . And the minigame is quite well-designed  but after a while it just becomes tedious and grindy for me .
- - do nt forget the emails . Cringe . the emails I ve sent to boyfriends . cringe cringe cringe .
  - I ca nt tell you how many times I ve wished that emails would self-destruct  like Mission Impossible tapes ...
- - Oreo Cereal . I was heartbroken when I learned they no longer make it .
  - They still sell it in South Korea .
- - It becomes a lot less common  but it still happens on occasion when I finish a truly great show .
  - I experienced this exact thing today with The Tatami Galaxy .
- - I assumed they are building show Jamie as the good guy and left that part out to not ruin his reformed image  excluding the rape scene
  - Yes but the rape scene was an accident they wanted it not to be rape
- - was this in the onion or something 
  - A British magazine called Viz . It s Britain s finest literature 
- - More like people with good decision making skills do nt get caught with bricks of weed and cocaine in their trunk .
  - Yeah  it s definitely selection bias . People with good decision making skills do nt make it onto episodes of COPS  keys of coke or no .
- - That s entirely too organized for me ... wan na come over and take a whack at my filing system  Seriously . My filing cabinet is a total mess ...
  - I probably would if I had free-time . xD I love organizing things .
- - Oh ya those c section scars really do it for me .
  - Sarcasm aside they actually do in fact do it for me .
- - Belfast would nt be bad at all . Are there any major differences that would affect me in Northern Ireland as opposed to South 
  - It uses a different currency  other than that not really no
- - good map IMO  and glad they are supporting something new
  - I like it  but my friends wont play any other map since .
- - Guys I know you re upset  but please I do nt want Cutler .
  - I would nt mind at this point . Seeing him throw deep to AJ could be fun .
- - God job  You have talent  Wish I could do something like this .
  - It takes year  or it took me years . But just keep at it 
- - Do you have very little interest in making decent money  If so  JUMP ABOARD 
  - It s very possible to make a solid salary if you work hard and are a valuable designer 
- - Shit that s a damned good last line .
  - Great username  too . Strong start  strong finish .
- - Flamestrike is now rare . For arena .
  - ever since GVG flamestrike s appearance has lowered . as more and more cards enter the pool  the chance of getting a flamestrike is just less and less
- - Dafuq did I just listen to ... 
  - One minute and fifty five seconds of pure pleasure  baby .
- - Throw your tissues away in a trash can with a lid  coat one tissue with pepper and let her encounter it .
  - Regular pepper  Okay I ll try that .
- - That s such bullshit  actual oppression negates all of those perks .
  - I think this is saying people want to pretend to be oppressed . Not That anyone actually wants to once they realize what it is .
- - FCS teams were always fun to play with . Maybe they can actually have a parallel dynasty .
  - Yeah I hated that FCS East stuff . If you re going to include fcs schools include the actual ones .
- - Why are you disappointed  It s a single SV card .
  - I m disappointed because his stats should be better .
- - Holy shit  when he grinds the other grinder . So good .
  - The more sparks  the more work is getting done .
- - I wonder why this got censored by mods  Weird . Edit . Weird it disappeared now its back .
  - For some reason  someone is gunning to push us under . Some pretty nasty down voting going on here .
- - Wonder what it would take to put that back to stock  so it does nt look so stupid .
  - you mean so it looks like a boring minivan 
- - I m guessing it was nt the first straw . Either that  or the boss wanted to hire that hot chick that just applied for an entry level position .
  - She definitely applied for an entry position .
  - She definitely applied for a positional entry .
  - The one that was soaking wet due to the rain storm .
- - This could explain why Jimmy was nt himself shooting the ball lately
  - He is on bereavement . He is not physically bad maybe mentally .
  - I was thinking that maybe the person that passed away was on his mind and that threw his game off
  - I connected the dots in my mind after . No problemo .
- - So you are saying that your dad is living with this lady just because of her money  Either you are lying to yourself or your dad is a dick .
  - My dad can kind of be a dick sometimes  yeah . I never said he was perfect
- - Is it ibjjf  Because usually blue belts go first in ibjjf
  - Its not Ibjjf rankings but theyre using the entire ruleset from them . I think I will message the organizers and ask when my division will start .
- - Ok. Then how the hell do they not know what crepes are 
  - because crepes arent a world wide food either
- - You do nt think they re at all related  There seems to be a lot of people who subscribe and contribute to both of those subs .
  - dude you replied to ca nt get laid so he hates women  he s got a pretty hilarious post history
- - Hopefully the paramedics fully stocked up tables  chairs and kendo sticks before they lent the ambulance to the WWE .
  - It s The Sandman s private vehicle .
- - yes  please be online though so I can access your safari .
  - sorry I was off  now I am online
- - Are you fucking kidding me  I belived this whole god dam thing until the last paragraph you clever little shit .
  - I got to the last paragraph and lost it . I laughed until I cried . Ca nt believe I fell for that 
- - Fuck yes . I wanted him as HC  but this works just as well
  - It ll be interesting to see this if I happens . I ll be pretty excited .
- - Seems pretty nice  but the specs could use some work .
  - Aye I know  but I wanted to sorta keep it realistic . Incorporating a DSLR and a smartphone was already pushing it . P
- - I really like the airship one . That s cool . And small enough for a pretty short campaign  but with the capacity to grow very  very large indeed .
  - It s an excellent beginning . Players get to know their characters and the GM gets to know the players while doing something meaningful that will open a world of possibilities .
- - Why does your game look better than my game 
  - Could be that your brightness settings are too high . The lower brightness you set  the more moody and awesome the game looks .
