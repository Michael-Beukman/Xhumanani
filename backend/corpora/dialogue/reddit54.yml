- - Are the players made free agents or what 
  - Yeah all the first team players become free agents
- - Pretty dope video  but this team is gon na have some crazy language issues .
  - Somewhere in this thread someone said that rush said they communicate in English .
- - That s because Wal-Mart employees are retarded .
  - There s a reason he s working at Walmart . Also OP is a goddamn lying karma whore 
- - Why would beating us show people you could be good  I mean  you ARE good  but not because of that .
  - It was early in the season and people thought you were still pretty good .
- - Do you genuinely think she s calling you a murderer  Is your persecution complex that severe 
  - I m just saying jumping from taking offense to murder is a rather large leap
- - That looks nothing like CGI  ya ll need to get up to the mountains more often .
  - Yall need to play more video games 
- - Most likely works with twitch as well  I did nt watch any games on dota TV but I got one when I opened my game .
  - Only if you have Steam and Twitch linked  of course .
- - But there is no luck element in Hive ...
  - Maybe they never win Hive against their husband .
- - sounds like u got no clue wat ur talkin aobut
  - Sounds like you re an arrogant dick .
- - A god damn mosquito . Those deadly motherfuckers .
  - One of highest killers of humans apart from humans iirc
- - I feel very stupid for not taking into account different calendars haha . Very interesting though  thanks for the information .
  - No problem . I just thought this would be a better answer than simply stating that their proximity is not pure coincidence .
- - Off topic . get any new figures 
  - Not yet  waiting on my tpp snake and the figma solid snake comes out in April .
- - I assume you know the spot on top of the chandelier in the other lobby  Also look for potted bamboo  it s really easy to hide in .

  - I d like to keep the case and still have the look of the skin
  - Is nt the hybrid the one with the clear back 
  - No its the one with the gunmetal rim and the matte black back . I have the neo hybrid .
  - Ahh Gotcha . Dumb Spigen naming all their cases essentially the same gets confusing . Fwiw the ultra hybrid with a dbrand on the phone works perfect .
  - Yeah i did nt know about dbrand when I bought my case or i would have went with ultra .
- - Yeah . Your last comment solidified my image of you as a fucking idiot .
  - Why do nt you think that Jackson hates Tolkien s writings 
- - Is that Herb from two and a half men 
  - Honestly i have no idea . I tried to dig deep for a reaction gif or something and this was the best i could find
- - I do nt get what you are saying .
  - Oh . You know  to trade and stuff .
- - I wonder if they get so bored that they think it s a game . Like I m going to try and poop in that tiny target there .
  - I just want to know how his butt can aim that high .
- - Rice and beans with hot sauce . Yum .
  - Close  beans and corn with hot sauce mm
- - My favorite shoe this year by far . Best shoe i ve ever balled in .

  - I d like to know the answer to this question too . Alternatively  will you ever offer classes at earlier times 
- - thanks  did nt mean to bitch or anything was just genuinely curious
  - Khaldor I respect everything you say and do . We need to be better about it and appreciate any and all feedback from someone like yourself .
- - Why would you try and exchange at Best Buy if it was nt purchased from there 
  - The stock of replacements Best Buy has will be on hand to check the production date . Production date seems to play into the build quality of this stupid tablet .
- - lol the teams with the best players are the easiest to beat imo
  - Most do nt know nothing about football tbh
- - Yes  the additional colored war dice were kickstarter exclusives I believe .
  - As someone without any real knowledge of TEK  what did the colored war dice do 
- - These benches are on the wrong side and it is fucking with me
  - I wonder if it would mess up the players too 
- - The Grand Budapest Hotel  shortly followed by The Babadook . That was an interesting double feature .
  - Mine was a rewatch of TGBH . Not a bad way to start off the year 
- - By that logic  why not emigrate to the United States  Safer than Israel 
  - Is it  Will it continue to be 
- - She looks a lot like her mother .
  - I do nt think Korra s mom has ever worn make-up .
- - Speaking of which that scene with the gummy like people where she cut a leg and stocked it on another little gummy guy  that was creepy .
  - That was the first scene I thought of haha .
- - I wan na go to the Houston Escape Room .
  - Do it  I do nt know anything about that place but it sounds cool .
- - I must be missing something . It looks like a perfectly normal penis to me . What is your concern or question 
  - I guess its uncircumcised and to me it looks weird and to see others it looks weird to them and also I feel like I have alot of skin
- - Do you have a Geiger counter  Do they
  - yes  very faintly . Bananas are more radioactive .
- - I like that firebomb tactic to bait out a rolling attack for a parry  it s hilarious to see how many people fall for it .
  - lol it seems to work especially well on people who just got parried . p
- - You re ignorant . Have a nice day .
  - You re stupid . Die in a fire .
- - Bit crap putting the slip in a highlights video .
  - Yeah I closed it as soon as it came around . My heart ca nt handle that right now .
- - how is that juice  been wanting to try it .
  - It s pretty good  but I would nt pay for it again . Cloning it should be rather easy .
- - I only tip if I think they deserve it  thank god I m not living in a barbaric country where people have to rely on tips to get by .
  - What country to do you live in that people do nt have to rely on tips to get by 
- - Plus kids are basically more cartilage than bone . Mother fuckers are so squishy they do nt break as easily .
  - Well as everyone knows kids bounce back .
- - Do nt oppress her  you cis male with your extension less hair . Check your privilege .
  - Mmm yes  down vote me . I feed on your butthurt and inability to recognize sarcasm
- - Wait so why did both Curse and Curse Academy have to change their names  I thought it was just one or the other
  - You are correct that only one HAD to change names but for reasons that have already been stated Team Liquid and Gravity are now the LCS teams that were previously Curse
- - Yup he is terrible  no vision at all  would nt be surprised if he is cut at the end of the year .
  - hey man  we got a playoff game and that s our special teams player you re shitting on . Do nt cause bad vibes . He still plays for us .
- - he was smiling and goofing off today . I wonder if he s already dialed it in for the season
  - He always smiles . He just has fun playing basketball .
- - But you do nt have to be in a backwoods country to be killed by a Muslim for satire ... that s a pretty big difference .
  - I m sure Nigerians will be thrilled to learn they are backwoods .
- - So ... We just went full Battle Angle Alita Last Order hunh ...
  - Was nt there supposed to be a sequel to that  I have nt heard anything
- - I dont understand people saying helios is really good  everytime i see him playing he doesnt do much
  - You cant say that about a korean in here you know 
- - I think the whole game should be thrown out ...
  - Of course  this is a bit of an overstatement . I will recycle my excitement from last year and hope this ends up being fun 
- - I need to remember this . Looking forward to the tutorial . Mine arrives tomorrow
  - I ll post the tutorial as a reply to this when I film it .
- - They are all in the inn . You just have to watch them from the duty menu  not the main scenario one .

- - Do you think your attachment to her is more to the idea 
  - Probably  but sometimes it works like that
- - Would he have been so brave if his bodyguards were nt there 
  - I m sure the paparazzi would be counting money in his mind each time Justin managed to swat him  as would the other paparazzi getting photos of any attack .
- - Sucks for the driver though he s probably been fired
  - I would be fired too if I broke the law at my job . I do nt see anything wrong with that .
- - huh  crawl back in or what 
  - Yeah ... crawl back in  that what i was going for ... maybe dig a tunnel in the process like a mole .
- - So do you think a child should be able to consent to sex with an adult 
  - i really do nt care about any of this  but please explain what that statement means .
- - I paid a small up front fee . I bought the game . Then it became free .
  - Maybe . I hope its not insanely grindy to unlock characters if it is free .
- - I think she was there with the guy on the right and realized she was petting the wrong guys head when she saw him on the screen .
  - She forgot that the guy she came with had black hair as opposed to the blonde guy on the left 
- - I could eat so many Junior McChickens and still make bank
  - What the hell is a junior mcchicken  Is it like a mcnugget slider 
- - Yes  because the people who grew up believing in opposing philosophies are not the brightest bulbs ... you really have to spell things out for them .
  - You said elsewhere that someone was just trying to feel superior . Then you say everyone who disagrees with your philosophy is stupid .
- - Excuse me  what does this have to do with bitcoin 
  - Since it lets you spend bitcoin on Amazon ... everything .
- - The main thing they do is gather assets . It s a business that pays well .
  - They may not do it well  but this is certainly not where the majority of their time is spent .
- - Has anyone ever recognized you  Which site did you use 
  - Nope . Nobody I know has ever recognised me  And I tended to use Chaturbate
- - This is why I d recommend sticking with arena for a while . As a noobie to mobas myself  I ve found this the easiest to grasp by far .
  - I primarily play arena because I m better at it  conquest is quite difficult to grasp what with all the terminology .
- - I am guessing Humira was already ruled out for you 
  - If not try Humira instead  much easier to deal with
- - Why would you record and have your sister fake that she was playing  I guess if that makes her feel better .

  - Yes  but only things that are already in your inventory for that character .
- - Why are you so certain that your local credit union is nt going to sell your mortgage 
  - My mortgage was sold by the credit union within a month of it originating .
- - And the goat balls were absolutely fine then 
  - They are nt the top of my list of things to eat again  but I was able to stomach them . In comparison  they re alright .
- - Remember all non-japanese IP addresses are banned .
  - I read somewhere they lifted that ban .
- - Things is that most Muslims in the US do nt even know Jack shit what the Hadiths are .
  - uh ... what makes Muslims in the US different from elsewhere that they would nt know what hadiths are 
- - I remember that going down  I thought it ended up like most of my subs but it is nice to see it is still going .
  - It s going ... slowly . I like it .

- - Why is there a face in the reflection  It s scary
  - Lol that s not a reflection . That is something on the shelf and you can see it through the glass
- - Loosely regulated . When s the last time any of your local utilities had a rate increase blocked 
  - happened a few times here  but it is rare . they also had to give us all a rebate when they made too much in one year
- - The only country that counts is outlaw . I ll give Hank Williams and Johnny Cash a pass if you consider them country artists .
  - You should give Billy Joe Shaver a listen .
- - You still get the poops and the sluggish feeling  even if you drink enough water to avoid the headache .
  - With or without water I do nt get hangovers but I definitely feel groggy . I take psyllium husk fiber daily so I never I have had poops .
- - You do nt know how to crop a picture in paint 
  - Well yeah  but I felt like giving the whole screen experience .
- - Statistically  that was the only interception chance you are going to get  FSU  and you fucked it up .
  - They way he s playing  Mariota will give out a few more chances
- - Again  Do nt you or someone else post like every week or two weeks 
  - I think you re thinking of the SHL that simulation hockey league thing .
- - How many triangles did the model have to be so slow 
  - no idea . People do nt usually post a triangle count and the speed of the cut typically changes more based on my layer settings .
- - Not all people who watch anime are as autistic as these people . Even I hate these faggots and I watch anime .
  - There s nothing wrong about watching anime as long as you have the decency to do it in private and feel ashamed .

  - He better not drink soup any time soon .
- - nope  but i did start in late january .
  - In the same boat myself  pure coincidence that it was in the beginning of the year .
- - Im both inspired and humbled by these . Everytime i think i have a good grasp on css or js I find something that just baffles me .
  - Agreed  Codepen is amazing at being great for learning new things while simultaneously being depressing as hell .
- - Ugh . My sphincter puckers at the thought of its price .
  - Right  It seems only the most expensive  flagship models allow me to use the things I bought for cheaper last gen ...
- - I do nt want to do anything at all . I just want to stop thinking and being . I am a senior this is my last semester .
  - Ok . So get through this last semester  and then do some good in the world . What is the course 
- - I really appreciate the in-depth and thorough reply . Definitely gives us some more to think about
  - if you guys are on east and decide to keep playing you can feel free to add me 
- - I had nt seen it with the commas . Thanks
  - Often commas are omitted when referring to crystal faces  though it s normally at least in parentheses .
- - Says the person who has clearly never met a Muslim
  - I do nt agree with the guy  but did you just insinuate that one can judge an entire demography by meeting a few of them 
- - Ah . It also turns out the NWT is aluminum or some other metal  not silver .
  - All of them  That s an interesting detail  every publisher would have to coordinate . Huh .
- - Not really . OP used a site that still gives them ad revenue  better to simply post a screenshot  preferably taken when viewed with ad block enabled .
  - They do nt get ad revenue from do not link
- - I d like to hear the other six .
  - john bonham  ginger baker  mitch mitchell  levon helm  charlie watts  keith moon .

  - You are literally hitler for using that priest skin
  - the inconsistencies on the rim of the hood are very annoying
  - I personally think the glorious nun skin is the cutest
- - It s almost embarrassing how much joy I got out of this goal ...
  - Hah  imagine how I felt . If my girlfriend was here I would have made her watch it and she would have called me stupid
- - I thought that the mill deck ran one ooze and one BGH so you could brewmaster back whatever you needed for the matchup  since you were running them anyway 
  - To be honest  I just made that deck up so I have no idea what I am supposed to run .
- - Car looks pretty solid . Never a bad thing to take it to an independent mechanic  and have them do an inspection on it .
  - I would love to  but unfortunately it s out of state and I m making a weekend trip to go see it .
- - You using adjustable landing gear  My favorite mod .
  - Not yet . But I guess I will soon .
- - I m confused as to why this would invoke a furor .
  - At least it did nt invoke a Fuhrer
- - Something should be done . Pretty lame that it s being swept under the rug
  - I d actually even be content if they learn from this  make rules about this to prevent it happening in the future and then apologize .
- - Who won  Who s next  You decide 
  - Russel VS natalie  I wan na see the shitstorm in the comments that would ensue
- - Controlling your kids starts at home . If you let your kid act like an asshole at home they wo nt suddenly become angels in public .
  - My kids are far wilder at home than they are out in public or with others .
- - Or these people could use the irc  there s a ton of people always looking to do stuff over there .
  - IRC is the way to go . Real time help is always available . Super easy to get groups together . And they are legit players .
- - There really needs to be a tutorial on how to take a proper screenshot in the Helpful Links .
  - The people who need it are the people who are nt savvy enough to look there .
- - You must not go on the internet that often
  - I go on the internet quite a lot . Personally though to me this is the strangest I ve seen a human behave he has completely lost his mind

  - That dude is literally just running around drop kicking people . I m in tears .
- - If you do nt respond  I ll tag you as something not nice . What do you do to keep your oranges so orange and without blemishes 
  - Probably just gets lucky with the weather and environment
- - I have infinite respect for Maut . He is the embodiment of the NA scene to me . Absolutely love watching him cast
  - You have no idea how much this just made my night .

- - Thank you very much Bro . The pleasure is really mine to be flying with such an awesome group of people

  - Having a vagina has its perks ocasionally .
- - You are only coming through in waves  your lips move but I ca nt hear what you re saying .
  - When I was a child I had a fever My hands felt just like two balloons .
- - If I bought that house  I d buy a roomba and dress it up as a little probe and be in nerd heaven .
  - And then have a few lobsters chase it to simulate drones attempting to prevent a cannon rush .

- - Turn signals  they have a purpose but seemingly it eludes some people .
  - Such a simple task that could make a world of difference .
- - I wish Nick Young would go away .
  - Nick Young is slowly becoming my favorite player . He kind of reminds me of Tom from Parks and Rec .
- - Saving Private Ryan at the end when he asks his wife if he has been a good man .

- - I m a conservative and do nt cry about people who use semicolons ; only a shithead would .
  - You re a self-identified ideologue so that makes you a shithead regardless . Go cry about birth certificates and I ll stick to focusing on important things like punctuation .
- - If you think that self-interest is the way to be moral  then everyone should be self-interested . Hedonism can be a universal morality .
  - I just dont think morals are set in stone  and it all depends on who you are comparing it to .
- - Are you the same guy who pmed the other day worried he scammed you 
  - I think that was someone else he scammed
- - That s exactly what I was afraid of when I saw them sitting in the aisle .
  - Yeah the pads are okay if you re in desperate need and the dollar store is near by  but the tampons should just be skipped all together .
- - I like the corsair software which works with the PSU  does seasonic have it too 
  - Nah the seasonic psus wo nt have that but they are more reliable than corsair .
- - Avoid America and go for Germany or Canada due to such a low cost to almost free .
  - Canada wo nt be that cheap unless he s a Canadian citizen .
- - I m hoping that TITP got trolled . I mean  who would look at that and think it s a gate 
  - They get trolled so much it s kind of hard to tell anymore .
- - Alternative headline . Labour chooses this guy for ultra safe tory seat . May as well enter a toddler for all the difference it will make .
  - But now he ll be able to pretend like he s earned his stripes  and fought valiantly in an unwinnable seat showing true grit and determination against all the odds .
- - I ca nt believe these fuckers got away .
  - They have nt gotten away yet . There s still time for one lucky frenchman to execute these fuckers .
- - Thank you thank you  but I only came second .
  - That s what she said . Joking  and congrats  Your flag looked amazing . . D
- - I d take it as soon as I could grow a beard ... But I might die before that happened .
  - As a guy who has had a full beard since grade school  enjoy it while you can .
- - Dog owners love telling other dog owners how they can be better owners lol . Even if all they see is one photo . Adorable picture
  - Same goes for parents . I think everyone needs to step back and get a little perspective .

  - Sure  if that s their prerogative . If not  let them eat cake .
- - I m actually in Vancouver  where that culture largely does nt exist  which is really quite odd .

  - Same with me  i used to drive with my right untill i got a manual car . Now i use my left regardless of the vehicle im in .
- - It does not look like an AMA  it just looks like a bunch of criticism . Why would they be proud of this 
  - Max is a very sad and lonely man  playing fantasy .
- - I hate to be that guy   but the title is annoyingly misleading IMO .
  - You re not that guy  . OP is Fox News level mall ninja .
- - I m pleasantly surprised by this . I ve only ever heard a few Deftones songs until now  and they were nt exactly chill ...
  - Oh yes  they certainly have loud songs .
- - You re just too skeptical man . You should stop reading Terry Jones articles and watch some hockey games instead .
  - Yes  watching Oilers games will cure my skepticism . Good advice  Captain Opposite .
- - If you do nt want people to ask about your book  why do you mention it 
  - I m not against it . It s a common line  though . I like to make it a little tougher for them ; D
- - Good on Jameis for staying out there .
  - Well now it can be said he s not a sore loser .
- - Great thing about this game ... It s none . Great game vanilla . If you want more fun then yes there are some .

  - No . I mean  they could . But no .
- - So cute  English mastiff or a mix 
  - She s a mix  but definitely the sweetest dog I ve ever owned .
- - FUCKING GET HIM BACK IN THE SQUAD YOU SHIT CUNTS
  - They wo nt . He s got more chance playing for SA
