- - Was Rob Ford included in this study 
  - They specifically excluded as they felt he unfairly skewed the numbers . Source .

  - Yes . Even Denna . Even Auri .
- - I m all for it  only I live in Philly and I m yet to see anyone pick anything up off the ground .
  - Yes  I agree . I guess my question is the age old how do consequences of actions and intentions of those actions affect the morality of the outcome .
- - Because they are full of hate  friend . Most people grow out of it
  - I think he was making a joke ...
- - Just get good life insurance regardless . You can slip in the shower and die .
  - Dude I fucked up my shin bad one day doing that . This is the real danger OP .
- - Eh  really  I know it was nt a particularly strong year  but best 
  - Closest second out of what I ve played is Shadow of Mordor  so I do nt know . It has nt been a very strong year .

  - Which is what little o nd fans claimed the penalty should have been .
- - I was worrying that i wo nt find this

  - Yeah I gotcha  I just do nt want to give any kind of impression that I blew them off lol .
- - Jar-jar Binks did not ruin the original trilogy .
  - The Holiday Special  on the other hand ...
- - Right but having your hand in someone else s pocket means that you are doing their bidding in exchange for money ; that is what the expression represents .
  - No  having your hands in someone s pocket means you re taking money . Having somebody in your pocket means you paid them off to do your bidding .
- - That might be a good argument for changing the law . Not such a good argument for breaking it .
  - I kind of look at it like Robin Hood . Clearly illegal  but robbing from the cartels to give to people who just need an affordable ride across town .

- - STOP BEING REASONABLE . CLEARLY THIS IS INDICATIVE OF THE JETS  BEING A CONTINUING CIRCUS 
  - A circus  No . A shitty team  however  Absolutely .
- - This looks like boredom ; OPs pic looks like any dog looking for something tasty in the trash .
  - Yeah  we were nt able to walk her that day  lesson learned .

  - I could see a race team with Ryan Fitzpatrick at CC and JJ Watt as the pit crew being successful .
- - I think you forgot to link the image .
  - Didi I  Whoops  lem me fix that real quick

- - ZG Sport Touring screen . Ca nt wait to really test it out .
  - Report back on how you like it  Looks good on there .

  - The opposite of vanilla is what  Brussels sprouts 
- - The news will be Japanese will be playing the game next month and the rest has to wait until year end haha PLEASE UNDERSTAND
  - Do you know how much work it is to localize a game with a crapload of text and voiced dialogue 
- - Amazing story  probably the best one I ve read here . Just a heads up  it s Johns Hopkins  not John Hopkins .
  - Thank you and thanks for the heads up  I ve corrected it 
- - Yeah and a bunch of feelgood tweets do not cancel this crap out .
  - Where did I or anyone say that  It s just showing that she has also posted tweets calling out racism .
- - do nt message this guy . he just wants pics
  - nope I did nt message you cos you ugly af
- - I can not see this working at all  is there even ANY favourable matchups 
  - Hey man  he won some normals  cmon ...
- - I think that would just piss me off
  - The one to the far left looks surprised .
- - HEY I LL LET YOU GUYS KNOW WHEN MY HEART STOPS POUNDING SOMETIME TOMORROW PROBABLY OK
  - Yeah  and now I m supposed to sleep  Not happening .
- - What type of brakes does that thing have  I imagine they d have to shoot anchors into the ground to hold it still .
  - Towards the end it rolls forwards during thrust .
- - Are nt you a naggy  bitching  cranky cunt .
  - And are nt you just a little pussy .
- - Hmm . I suspect your clarity issue is due to the protein rest .
  - Interesting  I ll look into that . Thanks 
- - I ll probably clone from her collection  she ll let me do that if I ask gently . P
  - Let me in too ... hoho ... . D
- - Also  ISIS would be happy to put these guys out of business and in the ground  so fighting against ISIS is really in these guy s best self-interest .
  - Maybe they are also hoping to get some weapons out of it considering America has a consistent view of the enemy of my enemy is my friend .
- - This is not helping my choice on returning to the tech industry or saying screw it all and going to work as a carpenter .
  - I d love to do this as a retirement job . Need more tools of course and a workshop that is not my garage .
- - steelers didnt get that call last night either
  - Neither did we in the first half . Because that s the rule ...
- - Keeps looking more and more like a normal controller . Glad they are tweaking it rather than releasing a crappy product though .
  - that is  like  valve s entire mantra .
- - Why is she not signing herself up for HER classes 
  - Maybe she likes to be surprised by what classes she s taking .
- - This is responding to people in the thread looking to sign up and get killed  on top of not helping the Kurdish cause .
  - I do nt see a single one of such 
- - There d be no reason to play any other deck
  - Unless they put Containment Priest in standard .
- - Well at least you can farm some bladestone .
  - The game insists on screwing me that way too because I ve only gotten chunks of bladestone .
- - He felt threatened in a situation HE started by assaulting one of them . Fuck him . He should not have access to a gun .
  - If they had called the police he may have lost his carry permit .
- - Leave it to an engineer to try to put the Pvc together before you even dig the hole .
  - Worked out OK though . Gluing in a hole is also hard .
- - AoT did nt kill off a character every episode .
  - Akame ga Kill did nt kill off a character every episode .
- - FLAGRANT ON BOOZ  REALLY  FUCKING BIG MOTHERFUCKER IS FLOPPING HIS ASS OFF EJECT HIS ASS
  - If that is a flagrant then it s a miracle Boozer is nt ejected every single game .
- - So that s how you get four gay guys on a stool  And I wasted all that dough on a dancing horse .
  - You do nt have to be gay ... just sayin 
- - Contributing to the conversation is a very subjective thing ...
  - Why would I think when I have the power to just hit a button  
- - Do we know if the rate of fetch lands per pack in FRF will be lower than KTK 
  - we dont know but it will presumably be lower since its competing with more cards in the same slot thats just speculation though
- - No one is comparing drunk driving to revealing clothing . A personal belief that runs counter to professional values .
  - Regardless  it is not the exact same scenario .
- - i like the idea of a keyboard included  then you can move your main keyboard away  center this in front of you and really play
  - Also keeps it as one unit  both physically and in device manager .
- - Wow Bogut and Lee on at the same time . Have nt seen that in a while .
  - I got used to not having either . Its going to take a few games to get back into a solid rhythm .
- - I have a hero s hat  Let me know when you re ready to trade .
  - Do you mind if I come over with Katie too 
- - Interesting choice . I figured it would be Plano .
  - I think of Allen as the poor man s Plano . I could be wrong .
- - It shits on the entire TES series on a core level from basic mechanics to story in every realm .
  - Got any specific examples or you just gon na remain extremely vague 
- - I do nt understand how you had time to take those photos . That outfit demands a fucking .
  - Lol trust me I got plowed after really hard . My legs were shaking .
- - I ve heard of Grand Budapest Hotel but not Southern Wild  I ll definitely try to watch both over break .
  - Ca nt recommend either of them highly enough . Seriously . Breathtaking movies .
- - Riot s are scumbags  this was a really dirty move ...
  - Yep . I m still upset about this - not buying any more RP  ever .
- - When I do this and load the game  normal Brawl runs . I tried going to custom stages  but nothing happens .
  - You have to put the pm folders and files on the sd card .
- - Obama . Because if Biden was in charge  well  you know ... shit would go down
  - Agreed . To even think it could of been Palin at a time is scary .
- - Roll tide  Or not . I would prefer that you not .
  - All that means is that it s time to get the Tide detergent out because they made a mess .
- - That song hits oneself right up side the head .
  - Me too  I remember hearing it in Cruel Intentions and being captivated by it 
- - I think after enough conditioning your junk will look like a proud lion with a flowing mane I say go for it .
  - There is nt exactly a ton of mane to flow  but maybe there should be .
- - Wan na trade with a SOtF flair  Pls pls pls
  - Already have it on an alt  not looking to trade for it . Sorry .
- - Even if I take it back to Walmart and tell them something outlandish 
  - I m really only speaking from the perspective of a manufacturer . A retailer might be able to do something for you .
- - Not at all consult a professional . What strings  Skin  Blood vessels 
  - He s talking about snapping your banjo string
- - I run Grodin in my first slot and I just got to his autoheal awaken . Added 
  - Thank you  I ll use it every chance that I get .
- - Batman and Robin . It may be a bad film but it was pretty amusing .
  - Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze is just brilliant with those one liners .
- - Yes . The first is far better than the second in my opinion . The second one is watered down and they took a lot of the cool stuff out .
  - Is the first one still modern enough to be played  I do nt know how old it is haha
- - I hope you do nt overwatch me then because it does that in almost every match to me .
  - So you imply that you watch every replay of yourself  And you analyse every flickshot you do  Sorry  but I do not believe that .
- - Fumble or incomplete pass are the two options on that play . Wtf ref 
  - Yeah that was a very interesting sneaky call that noone on TV even acknowledged
- - I was kinda bummed when The Burger Guys closed ... I guess I m kinda a Texas purist  because sometimes a Whataburger is my go to burger .
  - The Vietnamese burger at Burger Guys was really  really good  but the place was so inconsistent they were destined for failure .
- - Yup  that s exactly what I was referring to . For some reason my link did nt post  but it s fixed now . Thanks 
  - Sorry I m kind of new to football  why is the QB holding for the kicker 
- - Or they liked the new vision that Pace brought to the table .
  - Making up his mind without a head coach probably made them like him a little less .
- - Luke was saving her because he s an idealist  and tricked Han into believing he would receive a reward . Han was the dumb one .
  - Or maybe it s just because she was hot .
- - My mistake i mean the target path of the shortcut for the browser . I bet it added itself to the end of that
  - I see what you re saying . Another user in this thread pointed me that way and it solved my issue . Thanks 
- - Wait  what about the code for elite X that people found  Surely the implications for a red son team are pretty catastrophic .
  - Most games that have Roman numerals go up to x . It s just how they work . When you get x through hacking in this game it does nt change stats
- - I d rather play games than watch others play them .
  - i play games  then sometime i like seeing how peoples will react to something i already played .
- - Does it take a while to download  The file is huuuge
  - just think of this way  huge game means huge content  huge content means endless fun xD
- - I m still trying to figure out how they assemble these types of images . They look like they made them using fax machines .
  - The image in the OP  or the images of titties in health books 
- - Seen it  painfull in all the right and wrong places 
  - Oh God that movie was painful  I like the plot though  they could ve done something with it
- - Being disorderly should be illegal regardless of how much alcohol someone has ingested .
  - I do nt think any group of people should be orderly at all times  sounds very unlike human nature .
- - If he could get me one of those chicken parms that would be awesome
  - I think you d have to sign up for State Farm before you can collect on that .
- - Is everything cheap out there like that  That s insane . Brb moving to Cairo .
  - Is everything cheap out there like that  That s insane . Brb moving to Cairo .
- - because some people have to cancel at the last minute of queue and do nt want to receive an abandon
  - then ... do nt press the button 
- - How glorious sleep is  I was not expecting that much sleepless nights
  - Yeah thats one thing I ve been told . I barely sleep as it is so HOPEFULLY that wont be a big problem ... hopefully
- - I agree that it is good with the right perks  but your list is wrong ... Field Scout is literally the only perk that makes this gun relevant .
  - Field Scout is really bad if you have Last Round  you want reload perks instead .
- - Up voted to hell and back . Was a little disappointed to see a small gap  only to have my mind blown at its function
  - oh darn they made a mistake  oh oh oh look at that  no they did nt .
- - Vote for cuomo  not the homo .
  - Funny thing  that poster was made by the current gov cuomo  who  like his father  is an incorrigible scumbag .
- - I signed up with the information needed  but it did not update the total number of sticks .
  - Did you follow the instructions to cut and paste the previous row 
- - Too bad Doneil Henry is nt starting for West Ham . MLS vs MLS .
  - I think he was placed right into the senior squad which is really surprising .
- - I ve heard that s good but seeing the burned face is just not appetizing to me . I d stick to the corn and cole slaw .
  - Uh  well that s where your food comes from  man .
- - Hopefully they ll sign it back on and this time the UK might get the last few seasons
  - Not until the content owner has squeezed every last drop of DVD revenue from the UK for those seasons . Only then will they relinquish licensing to Netflix .
- - Nothing wrong except the calibre of members there .
  - Oh god they re so stupid  and many of them are from all the banned countries which just adds to the stereotype that they re bad users .
- - Four mph over  That s rough .
  - They were obviously profiling . Looks like it worked though .
- - I left this game with a huge smile on my face  swearing THIS was the turning point in Canes football . lol .
  - You were nt the only one . Probably the best game I d been to since we moved out of the Orange Bowl
- - Someday  i will have that much gold .
  - I ve found that now that I have that much gold  I do basically nothing with it . I feel like an old codger .
- - Would have been great if you wrote the names in the order from top to bottom .
  - I can . Would you like me to or are you already familiar with the characters 
- - My guess is that since the BMW is rear wheel drive it would be much harder to correct on the wet surface than the front wheel drive GTi .
  - The GTi also had the advanced traction control Jeremy talked about later in the video . I do admit it was unfair if he turned it off in the BMW .
- - Do people actually get into games  I do nt .
  - You can do campaign or customs for this to pop though .
- - Breaking Bad . As someone who understands chemistry  it is such a boring show
  - I understand if Breaking Bad is nt your cup of tea  but your explanation makes no sense . It s not a show about chemistry .
- - No one has had a good wank with it 
  - hmm good question  when you peel the clear part off the leftover peel is quite slippery
- - Actually I think I get it . We can both put items into the red box in your world  I m ready now by the way . D
  - That s correct  About to add ya .
- - I love your taste in makeup  Lipstick  yus 
  - Haha will do in about an hour or so so keep watch for that post 
- - Your eyebrows are amazinggg . And you ve got such a nice bum 
  - Thanks  I take pride in my brows 
- - The cowboys won AND there was gratuitous vagoo . The blessings are raining down upon us .
  - Just wait  the douchers on the ticket will find something to whine about today
  - Did you call in once and get told your idea was stupid 
  - No  I listened to them in passing a few times and made the assessment
- - if you do stop by and pick me up  i know the feel haha .
  - I ve thought long and hard  I m gon na do this  and panhandle my way to my destination  if you seriously want to I will
- - Is there any possible way to prosecute this nut job .
  - Yes  someone needs to file and FIR .
- - Please have your friend report back with the results .
  - He will as long as does nt fail and is then subsequently killed by his commanding officer .
- - I feel just ... so frustrated right now . In real life too . Just ... dammit . Freakin  dice .
  - I hate when I think I m replying to a PM
- - I have no clue how we stopped Wisconsin s rushing game ... we might actually have a good defense .
  - Our Defense will make you question reality itself .
- - She should separate from that guy this situation sounds like one that could turn more abusive .
  - I had discussed that with her  and was assured he was nonviolent . But I made sure to get across its still a form of abuse
- - Yeah . Need more Trump vs Reynad .
  - Both are off the pinnacle by a pretty big margin too busy managing their brand
- - One thing I do is to go to tvdb and look for the episode numbers .
  - Yep  bookmark that site . Sometimes the episode numbers are iffy there .
- - please show me the real version . the one with the real colours
  - We would nt see the colors . Just black and white
- - Neither price nor pre-order were available for MGSV either  and that still released on time .
  - true  idk it seems suspicious that a game like GTA wouldnt be able to preorder but you can say the same about Metal Gear Solid as well
  - It s because of Steam new rules for developers putting games on Steam . Blame the shitty indie developers who took the money and ran .
  - This is a publisher decision  not Steam s rules .
- - This animation reminds me of The Goofy Movie
  - The director used to work for Disney animation .
- - i think verizon is the problem . im lagging on LAN
  - Also have fios with packet loss right now . I ve always lagged more than any of my friends in game . Makes playing and csing impossible at times
- - That should ve been either a taunting or celebration flag on Hardy there .
  - I m glad it was nt . I love celebrations and I do nt want us to become the No Fun League .
- - They ll send it to Malaysia to use as their next plane that goes missing .
  - You re trying too hard to be edgy that it s not making sense
- - Unnecessary . A ride on a roller coaster is all that s needed .
  - Cant say im familiar with that one  I am intrigued though
- - Hard to kill penalties from the sin bin
  - I came here to say the same thing
- - Im planning to paint my Mario the same way  any tips 
  - I saved a lot of time by just pointing what I needed to . Face  hands  shoes and fireball are original .
- - Hochuli at least can explain things very well .
  - But can he explain why kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch 
- - Uh  why would he be staring at his own helmet 
  - I hate the idea that they ve built around Boba Fett of a whiney kid obsessed with avenging his father .
- - Like a white cloud dancing in the sky . Just awesome 
  - Cloud to butt extension  never fails .
- - I ve got a spare copy I can sell .
  - ahh thanks  but i got a free license for one year  maybe someone else needs one right now
- - Bring it to Philly to compete with Comcast on their home turf .
  - I have no idea what it entails  but if they could bring fibre to Philadelphia  they ll be both wealthy and heros .
- - This only works in the US  and only near the Mexican border .
  - I would imagine being near the Mexican border would be much  much worse .
- - Like the feels based  opinion of anti-vaxxers that endangers lives 
  - The difference being they are nt pushing the government to make their feels law .
- - Well I could nt imagine Brand ever selling out and writing west end musicals .
  - What do you mean selling out  Ben Elton is a writer  that s literally his job .
