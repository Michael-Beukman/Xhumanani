  - Kailibee is actually quite female  and tbh I do nt know what she set my flair as for today .
- - Good fire . Who wants a treat 
  - Give fire a burrito . Hot stuff .
- - That sounds like a pretty terrible idea  allthough I doubt most people would notice that it s an actual phone number and not just a ton of random digits
  - Apparently he s never received any random calls  so that s nice .
- - Guess only one team wanted to be here today  right guys 
  - Of course FSU was off  they d just had their chance at a repeat ripped away from them .
- - Yeah  mushrooms are real helpful for people with mental illness .
  - Your sarcasm indicates your total ignorance on the therapeutic qualities of psychedelics .
  - Your entire life indicates an inability to function like a normal  healthy adult .
  - Wow a reversal of what I said . You re the master of comebacks .
- - Meh well I do nt have any manga that I m marathoning right now so I guess I ll dive into it
  - Let me know how you like it

  - Speaker for the dead was just as good as Enders game . Love that book .
- - Yeah Frost bite loading times are always bad . My hard drive can handle but sometimes it takes forever anD I wish I had an SSD .
  - Same  could nt afford the extra for SSD when I built it  and have only gotten poorer since . Cest la vie .
- - if you exercise regularly  then your problem must be diet related  if your gf is going to leave you rather than help you  then you can do better IMO
  - The leaving thing was more of a joke . Diet s a good thing to look at actually  did nt think of that thanks .
- - Got ta keep some pepperoni on hand to beautify that pizza . Might as well add some bell pepper and banana peppers while you re at it as well .
  - I did have to add my own bit of flair to this one
- - I ve always thought that it would be delicious swirled into a cheesecake .
  - Can confirm  it is . I made one for Christmas . Made the crust out of speculoos cookies and swirled cookie butter into the batter before baked .
- - Are you able to eat or drink anything whilst there 
  - Yes  I even brought a bag in with tons of stuff  walked right in and picked great seat .
- - Well I guess you ca nt be perfect

  - Awesome ill try and use an app on my phone to get clearer pictures . Thanks for the feedback I appreciate it 
- - That s a nice photo  but there s no way a layup is going to be the one that gets picked to define Vince s career .
  - I was gon na say any picture of him in a nets jersey 
- - Do the Everlane silk shirts ever go on sale 
  - I do not believe that Everlane has sales .

- - Check out Reply All . It s from the guys who used to do TL ; DR for NPR s On The Media .
  - Thanks  Will check it out tonight .
- - What if Jurassic Park had angels instead of dinosaurs  They would also have to be Lilim since dinos did nt come from the moon
  - Angels did nt come from the Moon  they came from Antarctica and were scattered across the globe .
- - Well sure thats a much better wording  but you get the point
  - It s more than different wording  they mean different things .

- - I m no artist  but I did nt think it was horrible .
  - Yeah  I mean he definitely captured the guy s likeness

  - That s true . Even after wiping the firmware and slamming the phone on the ground  you can replace most of the hardware and reflash the firmware .
- - So I should stick with them then 
  - More or less yes . There is no cookie build except for adc s . Situational items can do great in certain situations .
- - do you have pics  i really wan na see this truck lol . P
  - Yeah  at school atm  you can just search my name on the sidebar
- - If anti-semitic cartoons attack a race  why is nt it just called racism

  - I should have mentioned these in my comment  and TJ Maxx  because I check these places often .
- - That is one happy little cocksucker right there .
  - Oh  totally . He s impossible to piss off . Perpetually running around and purring and chirping .
- - Mudiay can certainly shoot . Where did you get that from 
  - His biggest comparison in the NBA seems to be John Wall . A large  athletic point guard with flashy court vision and an inconsistent perimeter shot .
- - This is at the top of my fears list . Pen fall under my desk  gone forever . Shoe untied  live with it .
  - In my experience  once the pen hits the floor you can never find it anyway .
- - He s an idiot that s extremely good at the game  what s wrong with that 
  - Who said there s something wrong with that 
- - To people saying that Migs bottled that cross stop ... Try doing that while getting tacked by Kimbo Slice .
  - The ball went through his hands which Slice was nt even touching  Migs should have been able to catch that but mistimed it .
  - Ball went right OVER his hands . I reckon he could have gotten to it if Kimbo did nt have his hands on his shoulder holding him down .
  - Maybe I was looking at it from the wrong angle then ... I saw it from a behind the goal perspective and it appeared to go through his gloves ...
- - The same thing happens with League . Streamers will set their game to League of Legends and play something like Minecraft .
  - No one will ever see them anyway lol ... being at the bottom of League is invisibility anyway .
- - That would sound like a horrible thing to say out of context .
  - It s not like im worried about cripples getting mad at me . Ypu need a soul to be angered .
- - Still can not understand why an update or patch has nt fixed the goalie interference thing . If its not in the crease  it s not interference

- - They are staring at the last piece of cake . If I were that cake  I d be terrified .
  - I do nt think their friendship can handle only one slice of cake being left .
- - Jesus Christ . It all reads like something from Idiocracy .
  - At least he is nt offering free lattes .
- - Moto says L is pending carrier approval for the Turbo .
  - Oh so some time in August then ...
- - DC is very close and a definite good day trip or even a short vacation .
  - I used to live in Fredericksburg  I m I m familiar with it . Maybe ...
- - Lane Kiffin is rearing his ugly head -- HE WILL DESTROY EVERYTHING YOU LOVE 
  - No  the fact that Bama has an average QB and one WR is rearing it s ugly head

- - There are a couple very  very similar to this out there already . Personally not a fan of the exposed battery . That s just asking for trouble .
  - Which ones out there that are similar 
- - Lol holy shit if I was that paranoid Id probably kill myself . Must suck to live a life in fear .
  - Nonsense  it s very thrilling actually . Just pretend you re James Bond
- - This game is nt over by a longshot .
  - Your right  it s not  but I am certainly not happy about things right now .

- - Here comes my game center slide show . I was wondering when it d show up .
  - Still better than the impressionist collection that is my usual stream .
- - Lots of people have done this in the past and have had their accounts frozen by paypal . Donate to the charity directly .
  - This . Idea is nice  assuming the charity is nt a crock  but if he wants people to donate to a charity he should just link to that .
- - He shows that the guys who say . Elo Hell exist ...  My Teammates sucks how can i climb the Ladder  ... are just too bad for the next Division
  - So the smurfs on CS . GO that smash people in every game at lower elo do it out of compassion and enlightenment 
- - No one has EVER done this in the history of Data 
  - If that were his joke it d be amazing
- - I am so sorry for your loss .
  - Thank you its just hard believing this is real
- - Rather than searching for clues of masculinity in his wording  how about checking OP s user name 
  - Im a dude  and you would nt know that from my username
  - Correct  At which point I would dig deeper and your beer fridge in the garage gives you away .
  - Dude  you do the internet wayyy better than I do .

- - I am addressing your topic . Some libertarians are not cultural marxists . Fucking deal with it .
  - I seriously have no idea where this came from  or what you re talking about .

  - No one know we only call it a delicacy to make foreigners eat it .

- - Nice kit but get a rug under it or you ll scratch the kick drum .
  - Not to worry . I have a rug for when I perform .
- - I want to see it from another angle .
  - Trouble with other angles is the image goes from badass to bad .
- - TIL there is a Baghdad  Mexico .
  - There is a Bagdad in Florida too  like in that Top Gear episode .

  - Scan it in greyscale . Remove the grey bits . Keep the solid white and black . Done . D

  - They sound super versatile  Thanks for the suggestion 
- - Nope  You re definitely pregnant . D

  - And I d like to live on a planet of rainbows and diamonds  which is more likely .
