  - If I may  why do nt you like activator 
- - It amazes me how easily non-Americans can imitate American accents and how horribly Americans do when trying non-American accents .
  - I think it s partially to do with exposure . We ve all seen loads of American films and therefore have a bit of a grounding maybe
- - You want a living will to deal with death and dying requests . I believe death certificates are public record so your plan will not really work if people actually look .

- - How is this opening up any kind of discussion  A guy with a hatchet went after a cop  he cop shot him . End of discussion .
  - Its good though that the police have voluntarily chosen to release this and try to get in front of the story . Its a step in the right direction .

- - He accepted my friend request . Now I got ta try to get into a raid with him .
  - I ll need a FR . What kind of Raider is he  Make sure you call him out when he fucks up .
- - Why the fuck would you have that username

- - Clearly I m not a sports fan ...

  - And what exactly was the reason for mentioning that  A real world place is gon na look the same regardless of what game it s in .
