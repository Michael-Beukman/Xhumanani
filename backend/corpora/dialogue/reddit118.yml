  - I think he just got it  he takes care of his cars .
- - You have to be worth something for that to happen . Strike one for you .
  - Happy people are nt usually mean like that .
- - It still hurts a bit to see him without a star on his helmet .
  - I do nt know  I think he pulls off the colors well ...
- - What do they do with it  Laugh at it every morning to feel good all day  Use it for motivational purposes before exercising 
  - I do nt really know ... maybe the use it to find out where to place the stethoscope 
- - I like the hand tat bro  It go full sleeve 
  - It s going to be a half sleeve tat
- - I hope it changes even though there s no reason to  I like Sunday games more
  - As an Australian  Sunday games suck lol
- - I m assuming sheepstick does nt remove Void s Backtrack however 
  - Only Aghs s Doom can disable Backtrack  it is not evasion .
- - WHat happens when someone takes a slapper and misses the net  Do you rotate chasing pucks 
  - Maybe you get three goalies and have two on the side just to be safe 
- - Wow  they ca nt catch a break .
  - The Bersin fumble  roughing the passer  and Cromartie pick were huge breaks for them
- - I d do hot salt water rinses a few times a day .
  - Yeah  Does that help more with the pain or the infection 
- - We were nt allowed them for all the maths but we were allowed for physics and thermo .
  - I m jealous  I miss using my graphing calculator .
- - I live and work in DC . They do nt scare me .
  - It almost certainly wo nt be you that s killed . You ll be fine  someone else is going to die . That s what bring it on means .
- - I ve built with that mobo before . Super shitty .
  - In what way  I ve had good experiences with ASRock boards .
  - It s got an odd layout . Things are just in weird places .
  - How does that make it super shitty  It s a good budget mobo .
- - Oh no  She s driving ass backwards 
  - Alpacas do nt abide to our driving rules
- - If we are stringing up scifi writers for cardboard characters  we are gon na have to string up almost everyone ...
  - Does nt mean we should nt criticize bad writing . It s a mistake not to hold SF to the same literary standards as anything else .
- - Yes  That s great  Thank you  I d like to share this on social media with your credit attached to it  if you do nt mind .
  - Absolutely . Please do share  Thrilled you liked it .
- - It s weird how in your mind internet people are older .
  - I guess the natural assumption is that whoever you re talking to is as old as you are .
- - So I ve seen Muhammad banging a pig to muslims making fun of fatties . This sub truly discriminates against all people . I love it 
  - We need more posts about tards  autism  and furries
- - kos and mert were brilliant last season . those clean sheets were because there were no shots on target
  - Suck a dick with your made up stats
- - Do nt understand social networks that have invite only betas . You d think they d of learnt from Google Plus .
  - I think they do it to make usage volume more manageable .
- - This has already been posted and it s still low quality . Stop .
  - Link to where it was last posted 
- - I think the entire offense should be designed around getting Harris the ball in the corner with an open shot .
  - Probably would nt be all that hard to stop that offense .
- - I thought I was going to miss Ant s humor but I ended up missing his intelligence . The show literally has zero smart people on it now .
  - A very good point . I think we all knew how awful Opie was at his chosen profession  but I for one underestimated his ineptitude .
- - Did you ever figure what was wrong my watch started doing this a few days ago 
  - Nope . Still black screen . Call LG and they will replace it under warranty .
- - At least you recognise how wrong your behaviour was and had the hide to be ashamed of yourself . I hope your coworker was cool with the gift card
  - He was  he accepted my apology . Saw him with a new shirt the next day .
- - Jesus Christ please tell me you reported him . That is disgusting to even think of
  - I should ve . I just bailed . Ca nt find it now so might ve been removed .
- - any way you can show us some pictures  and do nt water again until they dry out
  - i ll grab some in the morning before work
- - Do nt know why  but I m really confused by what your numbers mean ...
  - They used commas instead of periods to indicate decimals  if that helps any . Each number is an average of all the ages in that season .
- - How long does it take for a match result to be updated 
  - usually right away  there are a bunch of active admins running the match results
- - Wow Begovic  that attempt at kicking RVP was dirty as fuck .
  - Begovic has been a bit of a cunt today  has nt he 
- - I am the most beautiful thing that many people have filmed .
  - What movie it s that from  I saw it a few years ago and liked it . But I ve never been able to remember the name .
- - Look what Peavy did for the Giants  An extra starting pitcher can only be good 
  - Peavy s a much much better extra starting pitcher .
- - I saw the contrast step and just started laughing . Talk about a gimmick .
  - When printing with film we would adjust contrast using coloured filters on the enlarger .
- - I m a conservative and would easily vote Republican if I lived in the US
  - With a bonus comment . I think we need more people like you in America .
- - One that fits . Helmets are a pretty bad thing to buy online because different models are shaped differently and everyone has a different head .
  - good call . i ll do that 
- - They ask to share but the video is forbidden in my country .
  - You re probably better off not seeing it  you ll just be angry .
- - he never expressed regret AFAIK ; do you think you could live Hitchens  life better than he did or something 
  - Well I guess that just goes to show that some people have different priorities and perspectives on life  then .
- - I hope you re wrong and we can move past all this fear of the sky nonsense and start exploring the heavens .
  - I hope I am wrong  too . I m not though .
- - Sounds like your landing gear is nt down .
  - nah it was down  but I was nt facing the right direction . took me a while to figure it out  but I think I have docking down 
- - Once that blanket came off and i saw how big that guys arms were I knew this was gon na be good . No homo 
  - Its all good . We all respekt the arms when the blanket dropped .
- - She writes well . You may not like what she says but she can give NVC a run for her money np .
  - Well  THAT is definitely true . NVC is awful .
- - Good thing that just normal ice on every day cars happens far more often than your inch thick ice in Canada . it s advice animals  every post is useless .
  - Actually  I ve lived in Canada my whole life and I ve never heard of pouring hot water onto the windshield  only using ice scrapers .
- - I was still expecting him to pull out his wand at some point during that movie .
  - He could ve hit the ghost with his patronus charm  you re right .
- - shit nigga when did saints get so fat
  - I was gon na say something about that  but I did nt want to be a dick . lol
- - The colour scheme reminds me of Red Alert for some reason .
  - Wow . Now that you say it I ca nt shake it . CONSCRIPT REPORTING 
- - I m willing to pay you to teach me a few bits regarding Wordpress coding . Would you be interested 
  - Can you give me a PM with more details of exactly what you need to know 
- - For them it s a game . For me it s a war where women s and girl s lives and happiness are on the line  including my own .
  - I like that  It is an ongoing war .
- - Well  now you re on a watch list .
  - Beauty is in the eye of the beholder . Shall I take your eyes then 
- - Shutter Island . One of Leonardo s best performances .
  - Not one of his best  but Ruffalo was pretty good .
- - oh my gosh ... i had never seen that before . i ve got chills .
  - It s so beautiful ... I cry evertim .
- - if you want the thread to die delete it op ...
  - I want it to die but is my child  I wo nt kill it
- - After dinner mints and diet coke . It is terrible and I love it . That is all .
  - Huh . If I drink diet coke after something minty  even brushing my teeth  I think it tastes moldy .
- - For Canada  best I have found is Forth Creek . But it is a blend I believe  so I do not know the blend .
  - Forty creek is Canadian Whiskey  not bourbon .
- - Okay Jameis  backwards slip fumble vs Sanchez  butt fumble . Discuss
  - While Sanchez  butt fumble is more embarassing and funny because of the butt  Jameis pretty much threw a TD to Oregon
- - What everyone else was talking about is watching old favorite movies a few times a year  not watching it over and over and over again in succession .
  - A few times a year is a lot . I would speak to my doctor or psychological if I were you
- - I kinda hope this guy shows up and gets rekt
  - Stand down with respect or prepare to get rekt
- - At least you know when to cut and run 
  - this is really the most important part 
- - Depends on what you re going for . What s the budget  Edit . misread post .
  - Nothing too crazy  a respectable price .
- - Because there are people on the internet that do nt know how to use the internet .
  - That s probably the best answer I ve heard . It s relevant for every part of every website
- - IS IT SAFE TO SAY THAT ITS OVER  
  - Not until the clock is zero or the Ravens are kneeling .
- - I do nt even know how I would be killed with this name .
  - Pretty sure that s a ticket to immortality .
- - is it weird that I jerked off to that blonde goalie 
  - how old were you at the time 
- - God damnit josh you re making Arizona look REALLY fucking retarded .
  - The state that gave us Joe Arpaio  Retarded  Nooooo ...
- - On one side I am disappointed he s leaving LFC but now I can actually see him play in person .
  - You and me both . Week after week . Second best option
- - This is really cool insight  Thanks  Out of curiosity  which college 
  - It was Division III  University of Puget Sound .
- - I m not Muslim  but still get angered by people jumping the gun with their reactions . That s exact sort of reaction that the terrorists want .
  - I agree . Unfortunately as you can see from some of the comments  this sentiment is quite widespread online . It s frightening if you ask me .
- - You do nt win  you look like an ass to anyone with half a brain .
  - So I d look pretty good to you 
- - Question threads are not the place to trade games .
  - My apologies thank you for the reminder 
- - What do you guys think happened to his scrotum when he took those nails out 
  - It probably leaked all over the floor .
- - Why not when they can capitalize on it  Again  I am not implying that this is the case but only saying this for the sake of the argument .
  - Because if they wanted to hush it up opening it to public scrutiny like that would be retarded .
- - You should raise the speakers to the top shelf and stand them both up . Get your tweeter up higher .
  - Thanks for the tip . Will try this
- - But they do make us better than we would be without them .
  - If that s how you want to rationalize it then that s fine  but keep in mind that a vast majority of war-torn peoples might disagree with you .
- - You basically just made a worse version of control warrior .
  - What is a good version  I m just a newb ...
- - Really interesting  never seen such an extended look at behind the scenes of a gdq .
  - There was one last year that I really enjoyed hopefully this goes on YouTube like last year as I ca nt watch Twitch from my phone .
- - excellent  thank you . I have plenty of absorbent material
  - Lol . Ok  that got me . I have nothing that can top that .
- - I think there are a bunch of writers who are insulted not to be on here .
  - It s hilarious that there s only one RPS writer on there .
- - You ca nt live next to the fukushima reactor either .
  - You ca nt live on top of a windmill  either .
  - But quite comfortably under a solar panel on your roof .
  - But you ca nt live around all the toxic waste that manufacturing a solar panel produces .
- - You know what  you re absolutely right and I ve now edited my post .
  - Thank you and I really appreciate your insights .
- - You . I like and agree with you .
  - I was hoping someone on the sub would agree with me  Glad you did 
- - Green gold bond right after a shower keeps it in mint condition . Good luck 
  - How s gold bond better than baby powder  Not trying to be snarky am seriously wondering if there are specific things that make many men choose gold bond over baby powder
  - Menthol . The gold is cool and refreshing  the green is like dry ice . So cool it hurts .
  - Woman but I also use gold bond . It s amazing .
- - You re right . Idk how I managed to mix that up
  - No worries  man . It happens .
- - no shit it s good  but it would be better if the laner got the kill
  - not always . if you have a snowball jungler  its better for him to get teh kill then he can snowball the whole map .
- - That eye is creeping me out  it just fits in so smoothly without any visible creases ...
  - If you look at it long enough  it blinks
- - As far as I know you have to insert the DRM key into vlc and when it works it only half the time and the menu system is fucked .
  - I ve never had a single problem playing BluRays with VLC
- - Oh no . Do you know the circumstances 
  - No I am not aware of that . Sorry
- - I ca nt believe this is real .
  - What a coincidence  IT IS NT 
- - For liverpool it is Shaq rumoured mainly by Di Marzio
  - What about Delph  Seen as the long term replacement for gerrard
  - I do nt think the club is looking to replace Gerrard as of yet ... and is not the one if he were
  - It was all over the news that they see Delph as the replacement
- - And Thomas Davis should be there . He s a top five linebacker  no question .
  - Make a list  put him on there .
- - i do  this sub is going to shit already .
  - While there have been a lot of reposts lately  I think it s mostly because all the new people who found the sub never bothered to check the old posts .
  - which is the opposite of what people should be doing .
  - You re not wrong  but I think it ll get better in a few weeks once all the reposts are out of the way .
- - How do you predict what the farms will produce 
  - you dont . you feed dragonfruit to a bird in a birdcage and they poop out dragonfruit seeds 
  - That answers another question I had about the purpose of bird cages .
  - They re incredibly useful . Birds in cages never die either 
- - I m sure he would recommend this as a nice beginner pack .
  - He would probably recommend this as an introduction pack into anime .
- - Also Tom Cruise and Flaming Dragon in Tropic Thunder
  - I m pretty sure Tom Cruise just has good chemistry with most people .
- - Maybe Jones and Vergini could do a half each  Or something . With OShea in the middle that should be enough to help Robson through the game .
  - That could work . Feel for OShea if he has to guide both Robson and Coates throughout the game  but he s probably up for it .
  - Yeah if there s anyone who would be capable it s OShea . Coates looked so bad in the last game  not confident about him at all
  - If it was nt for the fact that we hardly have any defenders  I d ask for Coates to be sent back .
- - I wonder if he has a book  I mean  it s not like he mentions it on any of his shows
  - I also wonder if his son has a publishing company or a ridiculous doctors on demand app ... Hmm ...
- - I use red and it works just fine .
  - It will do since the two colours have the same purpose but red has a higher breaking torque and will potentially strip the screw heads on the hardware .
- - I believe it was Alabama . I was nt really an apology .
  - It was Troy I was wondering if another one did it .
- - Wow I still cant believe he s leaving . Gon na miss him so much .
  - Do nt seem right when most people think of Liverpool they think of him . Top bloke  did well internationally for us too
- - Thats what i get for responding first thing in the morning  and im a dps examiner lol . With a permit all you need is a driving test .
  - So with my Canadian beginners I would just need to take a road test in Texas and I would have my full license 
- - Fair enough  I took it down for ya .
  - Oh  haha  I do nt mind . That was clever  I did nt even consider or look to see that their number was in the dumpster .
- - When a bunch of things you control would trigger at the same time  you decide the order in which they re placed on the stack .
  - excellent  Thank you for the quick response 
- - how do you word these emails     
  - Start off by thanking prof again and ask if there is any additional info they need for letter .
- - Tretinoin degrades when exposed to air and light . Yours probably is nt very effective I imagine .
  - Thank you very much  I ll just have to get my prescription refilled .
- - I m glad there wo nt be any magic . Magic was basically easy mode .
  - There will somehow be an easy mode in this game  and somehow fit the Moonlight Greatsword in it . Maybe the Moonlight Projectile attack .
- - In that case  why not just use vanilla  Just seems weird to me . I d like to hear someone s experience using marshmallow before I try it .
  - That s just what I read on another forum after a quick search
- - If Hawkmoon is second to Thorn in crucible  then its third to The Last Word
  - Do nt use the last word that s why I completely forgot about it lol
- - Why do futuristic cars always have to look dumb .
  - Beauty is in the eye of the beholder  and that looks awesome to me .
- - This picture is basically how he must look like in game . If they do his remodel like this  I would be very happy .
  - Yes it s just our ymir in really good update version 
- - Yea seems like it would of been a bot or something .
  - It was just me  I happened to refresh at the perfect time .
- - Could OP use the Asus router as a WAP 
  - Of course  but it would likely cost more than necessary
- - Because I made a promise to myself when I was a kid that I would never do it . I do nt want to let that little girl down .
  - I like that . Keep making her proud 
- - Anyone else see the one dude and think of the Disney Channel original movie Brink  Total douche .
  - They were giving us beef so we had to battle 
- - Watching Shaw play hockey is like watching breaking bad . I m rooting for him but I know he s the bad guy .
  - I m the bad guy who trips others on the ice  and hey  Here s a sequel to the last one just to try to get fans to cry 
- - A lot of people thought Spider-Man  Transcendence  and The Interview were going to be good .
  - Yeah well  good may have only one definition in the dictionary but we all have our own .
- - I m not getting into the psychology of it  I m just here to see if I m a freak with my ability to lose weight  not teeth .
  - If you saw a commercial for food and did nt immediately give in to the media s desire to make you consume more  you are a freak with free will .
- - No  you should be fine not doing that .
  - Ok cool . Thanks for the reply .
- - I love the album but do nt know much about it on vinyl . Is it rare  How does it sound 
  - It is nt super rare on vinyl but I had a hard time finding it . It sounds fantastic  Listening to it on vinyl is a whole new experience .
- - IIRC there is also a voter who refuses to vote for anyone who played in the steroid era
  - Which in turn is another reason why Randy Johnson is so good . He spent his career going up against those juiced hitters . Too many old  stubborn writers .
- - Are you ... are you watching every anime airing 
  - It looks like the only thing he does nt have on his list is kuroko no basket .
- - Not really  in both cases you die .
  - That s what apples and oranges means . They re both fruit . I was saying the outcome is the same .
- - This is necessary for lap band people . Chew it well or you will be unpleasantly surprised .
  - Definitely  Both of my aunts got that . Even just a few calories over or too fast and they regret it immediately .
- - Who s the bitch now  Jon dominated Daniel .
  - Tbh anyone who thought Cormier had more than a fighters chance probably does nt watch a lot of MMA .
- - You ve only got two options as a dog . you can jump in and swim  or you can pace the edge barking at those who swim .
  - for the love of god never go in that water .
- - But he showed initiative . He found a solution for an ongoing problem while his coworker was still having issues finding his footing .
  - When it comes to interviews I do nt know if his response has a leg to stand on
- - Oh no  Looks like he wanted to sit next to the little guy and then is wondering why the guy bit his butt 
  - By sit next you mean sit on . That s how cats do .
- - Canadian drives a hockey stick into the passed out drunken Irishman s head  pours maple syrup on the dead body  rides a moose into the sunset and apologizes .
  - Then he hacks a dart with the boys and goes for a good little rip  eh 
- - The gluten-free craze has the unintended side effect of making life much easier for those with celiac  so I do nt criticize the fad dieters on this one .
  - This is actually a very good point .
- - No joke unless you manage to use your wallet as a pry bar
  - Well it does have a pretty sweet bottle opener . I think it would handle quite a bit haha
- - Sorry  Im already seeing my analrapist regularly . I dont think Id be able to fit you in .
  - Never know . All that anal raping might loosen things up a bit .
- - We will see exoskeletons for the elderly and disabled much  earlier . They will be leased to the elderly who can not walk well .
  - How much earlier  Like next year 
- - And that is why he plays soccer . Think if he had an actual job where he needed to use his brain ...
  - You say people do nt need a brain to play soccer 
- - The breakdown was fucking intense . That spin move though .
  - His moves throughout the entire video honestly . Just awesome
- - I m not sure if countertenor will be of any use if he is a baritone for countertenor does not use falsetto .
  - Um  got a cite for that  What exactly is your definition of a countertenor 
- - More like  absolutely do not receive Communion until you become Catholic . Improper reception is a big no-no .
  - I was nt implying it was optional  but it s good to be nice .
- - Who is this man that looks like John Barrowman but surely is nt . I ve never seen this picture used before .
  - You do nt know who Tom Cruise is 
- - Nice fruit staking ... Would be a shame if ... someone were to pull out one from the bottom ...
  - Was fruit and veg assistant . Can confirm that anyone and everyone would .
- - Hulk Hogan did return once to save  if i m correct  Hornswoggle from The Great Khali on RAW but that was years ago .
  - He sure did  I believe that was his last appearance before going to TNA .
- - Great then Thailand would be like Texas . No thanks .
  - How would it be like Texas  Complete other end of the spectrum 
- - Fuck NY  seriously . They do nt get to dictate global use of bitcoin no matter what they might think -- they need an ego check .
  - They do nt get to dictate local use either . Math is not the state s friend .
- - It would be nice if the scoring was nt buggy af .
  - Yeah  they really dropped the ball on the live scoring . First it was taking forever and now it keeps changing . Working out the bugs I guess .
- - has nobody thought dice could just be trolling  and just sitting back laughing at everyone trying to find a monster .
  - Do you mean the two references they ve made to something being on Paracel Storm  I think one would be trolling enough .
- - WHY WOULD YOU RUIN A PERFECTLY GOOD PIZZA WITH MAYONNAISE  
  - My friend eats some weird combinations of foods . I ve seen her take a pepperoni pizza  then put sour cream  hot sauce  and popcorn on it .
  - Woah  sour cream and pizza sounds awesome . Not sure about popcorn though .
  - Finger tip sized globs of cream cheese on pizza changed my life forever
- - My ahab is a testy little bastard . At times simply refusing to write .
  - If you pull the feed out a hair it should get wetter .
- - Awesome work . What the hell happened to Ariza 
  - Not a contract year and no John Wall .
- - If any Cowboys fans think this is a legitimate win for them  they re more delusional than they normally are
  - You re saltier than you normally are .
- - Glue his hand to his cock and tell him to lift his hand up and down
  - I would try that method but I do nt want to get arrested for assault .
- - To have a normal  functioning brain free of mental illness .
  - And i hope that happens for you 
- - You think this girl went to college 
  - She dropped out of community college  in fact .
- - Oh god . The blatantly obvious picture taking . The people laughing at him . Is that a cane  It all adds up to me cringing into another dimension .
  - He s probably doing it as a joke and not in earnest . That s what I think  anyway .
- - Hope your psu ruins your pc Mr buttmad . happy new year op 
  - Happy new year to you as well  have a great one 
- - He worked alongside them though and apart from Kendrick and Aniston  I do nt know who any of the other people are .
  - You are nt familiar with William H. Macy  Not a criticism  I m just surprised is all .

  - Prob to get the rebound just in case . Edit . Yup
- - can someone explain why Heroes of the Storm s replied that way 
  - I imagine it s because HotS has mounts .
- - Is it sad that the Kubrow egg drop rate is so abysmally low that I m seriously thinking about doing this alert

- - try fat guys we got boobs and penis
  - thats disgusting . no just ... no .
- - Joker ... with the mask ... Oh god . I do nt even want to talk about it .
  - he actually got the equivalent once  and infinitely killed batman .
- - It would be nice if you mentioned your website or something .
  - I ll edit the original for clarity  but thanks for the suggestion  most certainly right .
- - Who is going to teach that class  Because as a teacher who belongs to a union  I can guarantee you -- it wo nt be me 
  - You ve already gotten your shots ... why should you worry  You d refuse a child an education 
- - Why does this sub either hate em so hard or suck his dick 
  - Hating Eminem is the cool thing to do online now .
- - If I ever embark on a journey to find myself  now I know what to do . Go to Iceland .
  - I ve always wanted to find myself  I just never realized I could join a search party to do so .
- - Which fight was that  does anybody know 
  - Off the top of my head I think it was Vs Dennis Siver
- - Oh good you came back for this . Otherwise my Sunday recipe was gon na be  like  ramen

  - your bit was very funny . And near the end where you said is it ok to come here  Lol
- - But is it clear the bombs are being set off by the Islamist immigrants  Or are they being set off by locals in protest of the immigrants 
  - Either way the root cause is anger over immigrants who do nt assimilate properly
- - Because the H in HAES stands for Hypocrisy .
  - Hypocrisy At Every Size ... sounds like them .

  - I guess other children have it much worse .
- - Latency is what matters  not bandwith .
  - I live in south Asia . Is that ok

  - The Internet is great man . Just do nt take it too seriously and your good .
- - This is basically the EXACT same position as me . And I love it as well .
  - I think GIS is going the way of this . More and more engineering firms are recognizing the value in GIS  which is great 
- - This could be anything right  Robot  cars  pen  bike  weapons  etc 
  - I d love to see what a cyberpunk pen looks like
- - you should have informed her right after the doors closed and subway started moving
  - This . But wait until the bus is just out of running distance .
