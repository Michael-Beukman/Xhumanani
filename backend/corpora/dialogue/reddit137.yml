  - Ehh  I m just a little salty about how you guys always bitch about cut blocking and stuff .
  - Everyone bitches about your cut blocking honestly .
  - Yeah  but you guys take it to another level .
  - Only because our games mean something usually .
- - Or just people who did nt play wow .
  - I never played WoW  but I can understand the context enough to get the joke . Maybe people who do nt play videogames wo nt get it at all tho .

  - Does nt seem like a Chechen name  the article suggests Chechen is a possibility though .
- - I said yes to not dictating peoples lives . I just feel his talent is wasted
  - I follow what you are saying and agree .
- - The CFO asked . What if we invest in our people and they leave  To which the CEO responded . What if we dont and they stay 
  - That pretty much summarizes the current attitude towards investing in development skills .
- - Clearly an airsoft gun  the handguard is nt even fully connected
  - That s the delta ring  but still looks airsoft .

  - I m stubborn  so I do nt give up easy . What would you say is wrong with you 
- - Because we re in such a politically correct society  that the thieves have more protection that the victims .
  - Laxatives are an over-the-counter medication intended for personal use that the thief ingested accidentally . They were meant for you . They are not poison .
- - I do nt get it . Where s the joke 
  - Punchlines are tools for Politically Correct propagandists so this brave freedom fighter forgoes them altogether .

  - Ya  I was thinking it looked like someone that actually drinks scotch made this list for a change 
- - Oooh . I hope that s not here to stay .
  - It s only on Thursday afternoon games  thankfully .
- - Did the roaster explain why it would nt work

  - Turns out the authority worship crowd is wrong again .
- - Cue the PT Cruiser and Pontiac Aztec drivers .
  - Cubes have no excuses . And Elements . Who thought those were good ideas 
- - I d do a small batch first to see if you managed to clean it out .
  - Probably a good idea . I ve got some yeast that I saved from a previous batch that should be good for a small batch .
- - Cool cool  I ll add you now ...
  - I am hatching for another match right now  so I will send you a Nice  when I am ready .
- - do you not get it in general or just not with your wife 
  - Just my wife . I still very much have a sex drive
- - I mean the dog is nice but that is one good lucking man .
  - Did you see the van in the background  That s what it s all about .
- - Because then everyone will build stacking items and fight over who gets last hits on the minions to get stacks .
  - Some stacking Items I get for the passive though  like Transcendence and Book of Thoth .
