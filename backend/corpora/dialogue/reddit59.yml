  - If fighting helped you win games in the slightest they would do it in the playoffs . It s as simple as that .
  - You completely missed the point i just made . So refs not calling as many penalties in the playoffs means we do nt need penalties

  - The taco deal was the stuff of legends . Definitely the best food deal ever .
- - Yeah  that s why he s been the silver surfer of Foundry .
  - thats such a great way of putting it lol
- - Ah yes  pressing questions in worldnews ; grooming habits of world leaders .
  - I thought it was somewhat funny . Daily Mail is hard hitting .
- - Nah you can have it . The WTC was attacked by fanatical Muslims and the ensuing invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan were justified because of it .
  - Brave . Make a claim then chicken out of backing up your own words .
- - I just got a shiver of satisfaction . Best use of the meme I think I ve seen .
  - Same here . I got a physical reaction thinking about it .

  - Really  i just have key search terms that i use that revolve around the fetish  if you wan na know the websites i can inbox you them .
- - The PC version is a classic . The SNES version is just an abomination .
  - As I suspected . How I would love to have a copy of the PC version ...
- - Tender . I hate tender the moist .
  - I ll take it one further . My most hated word is tenderloin .
- - probably a bttv bug or something due to the new implementations  give them some time to catch up with a new version
  - I do nt run bttv . No twitch plugin at all  maybe it s just something temporary .

  - I m English and I love listening to him complain  it s what the English do best
- - All I seen was Nadia  Trump and Reynad . All seemed genuine . Who else did I miss 
  - Tides did it too  but I m pretty sure it was genuine then as well .

  - I ve been wanting to start doing this for sure
- - I PROMISE you somewhere is an attractive woman who s perfect in every way and would be more then happy to indulge with you . look around 
  - I really do nt want to go about my life SEARCHING for someone who would put up with my vices ...
- - Wait  will this actually give them access to utility poles  Also your solution makes a hell of a lot more sense .

- - It has to happen . For jersey sales alone .
  - but ... i already have a domi jersey
  - but will he wear his old man s number

  - Peer pressure is a really good way to keep people in line  and so many people go chaotic neutral so they can do evil without being evil .

- - Yes really good mod but cant you make all in one  xD
  - It replaces characters  not adding them . So it s kinda hard to make an all-in-one .

  - Is there a tutorial on how to use it

  - Yeah I think it ll blend just about anything short of a crowbar ... Them names tho
- - Ca nt believe I want a Republican in the White House .
  - The US Congress is bought off enough already . We do nt need a Republican making SCOTUS nominations only to solidify electoral corruption .
- - Out of curiosity  is it because they re cropped 
  - He is cropped  but even if he were natural  he still would need protection . The ear leather on dobermans are thin  and the hair is very short .

- - If that fellow felt like sending me a pm regarding the information he sent you I would appreciate it
  - I would love that info as well . Would be very kind of someone to share
- - When she starts to interrupt you  pause  look at her  wait for her to stop talking  then continue with what you were saying .
  - This could be the best possible approach . It s not difficult  expensive  or time-consuming .
- - I think it s funny how you assume I m religious  I m atheist
  - How  I gave no indication either way . All I said was you are ignorant
- - I think we still must be physically in the same location  no FTL comms .
  - Well  I have chatted with friends across the galaxy ...
- - Is this similar what to Plex does 
  - This seems to do exactly what plex does .
- - How about putting revenge on him  Would it apply more dots 
  - I believe I read on here from someone that revenge does proc the debuff check on a monsters first move if it has one .
- - I used to love Cyclops . The X-Men were what got me into comics . Now he s just annoying .
  - You like the young cyclops series though right

- - gotcha . do you have a source on this 
  - Do you have a source that your idea would work 
- - you mean better than the DVD right 
  - yes  he did  context is nt hard to pick that up
- - I will as you as you stay the fuck away from the Baltics
  - And why should Ukraine do that  It is not in the ability of the weak to dictate to the strong .
- - The Prime Minister from Black Mirror . That man has the fortitude to do what s necessary .
  - That ll do  pig . That ll do .
- - Hire a locator beacon  better to have it and not need it  than to need it and not have it .
  - Yeah cheers mate I was going to do that  picking up from the Visitors Center tomorrow .
- - I think he would be reprimanded so quick by his own god damn teamates that the problem would take care of itself .
  - Yeah  why would a white basketball player start throwing that word around  it s just stupid .
- - Thanks for stopping by  We talk about a lot of promotions here  but NWA Wrestling never seems to come up . Glad someone did
  - My pleasure  I appreciate the interest in the NWA .
- - In what world was he playing the ball .
  - The part where he put his head up before any contact was made .
- - I feel like a pervert posting this .
  - Who cares there is no such thing as innocence on the Internet .
- - That s a shame  Well thank you for your input . The inspire looks pretty incredible  way out of my budget range for what I want however 
  - What are you trying to do  exactly 
- - If you have no teeth  then use your gums to live 
  - Love this . Is this a common Korean saying 
- - Vodka . It looks like water  means you can take it everywhere .
  - If you act up in our school  teachers pour a glass of your water
- - Having been around the military for most of my life  yes that is exactly what I m telling you .
  - Well having been part of the problem then youre obviously going to feel that way .
- - Property taxes are important to the social contract because there is a housing crisis 
  - Yes  land taxes motivate more productive and efficient use of land  and competition for tenants .
- - So how come we do nt call gay guys Athenians 
  - Because the Athenians did nt invent dudes loving dudes .
- - Is he serious or trolling  I feel sOAZ has been awfully quiet about the whole roster change situation  but maybe I just have nt been paying attention .
  - imo brokenshard is sure about soaz in Origen but i dont know if he is able to have tha kind of information
- - Well  to be fair  it could be a legitimate concern with David Bowie . But the average terper lacks that cheekbone definition .
  - Bowie was also likely on drugs to believe this . TERPERs have no excuse .
  - Likely  He was the living incarnation of cocaine for a while .
  - I guess that was an unnecessary filler word  lol
- - That s what the Genius at the Apple Store said when I took my iPad in for service ... Pretty crazy  yeah .
  - The genius knew you were Steve Jobs as a zombie .
- - I think Eastenders is the only thing keeping my Great Gran alive so I hope that show never ends .

  - I dream of this too  but where does my girlfriend always want to go  God damned Disney World  twice a year .
- - You wo nt be able to transfer your games and they will be lost . Do NOT do this .
  - Transfer my games  I only have cards .
  - You re save data  ID  friend code  and everything else is also saved to the system . You need both systems to do a transfer .
  - Thank you for the information  I was thinking about selling mine  but I ll wait 
- - I do nt know what s worse  his girlfriend fucking a midget or his terrible acting .
  - both wrong  it s definitely the elevation at which his and the other guys pants are sitting .

- - Shoulda looked at him and slow clapped .
  - I gave him the thumbs up then switched sessions .
- - You re first pic is very interesting . I m trying to figure it out . Are those blurred out branches in the foreground 
  - Yes this was shot through the branches of a live oak
- - They ve already said in the past that Uber would not be welcome in Gatineau .
  - They did indeed . My hope is that Uber realizes that many residents welcome them  regardless of what the city government thinks .
- - I can see why I have trouble keeping track . Have they mentioned Vegans vs. people who eat at the Keg yet 
  - That gets shoehorned in to the DT vs. Burbs debate .
- - Did it crack before it even made physical contact  Holy fack
  - No  there was just a backdrop behind the glass . I m guessing to keep the shards from flying everywhere .
- - What is this from  I know I ve seen it before but I ca nt remember ...
  - Cheech and Chong s nice dreams I believe .
- - I think Exmilitary is more aggressive than NLDW otherwise seems pretty fair .
  - Yeah I would switch Exmil and NLDW but other than that nice job OP
- - are they declaring  fuck me  lol .
  - Did nt watch the game . Can you give me some context 
- - If someone talked shit about monopoly in real life I d slap them in the face
  - I would and I have . It s garbage that drags down the hobby of real board games . Come at me  bro .
- - It would be really nice if people could react to this with sympathy for those who were hurt and killed instead of a hateful circlejerk .
  - Anger is one of the steps of dealing with pain
- - Wo nt work if the ref turns his head  the chest would point elsewhere .
  - If players can teach themselves to always point their hips and shoulders in the right direction  so can professional referees . We might need coaches for the refs though haha
- - Right after I buy the SL Loop Mocs
  - sl loop mocs are just as nice if not better imo . But yeah I feel you haha
- - all things aside what the fuck is what is up with soap operas and there wanky looking frame rate .
  - Apparently it has something to do with being shot on video rather than film .
- - I can only imagine . I know a few ladies that are currently princesses there and they said they re just wiped 
  - Wow  Face characters are the most demanding role because of constantly being in character on stage . Take a special person to pull it off .
  - Oh man . You just went there . I like you .
  - I did . I totally did . Thanks 
- - Honeymoon suite . You either got married to yourself or your wife left you alone on your honeymoon .
  - perhaps she just wanted to take a relaxing dump outside

- - How much time do you have at the academy  Cause you re less likely to get out of your commitment if they ve paid a majority of your schooling ...
  - I m a freshman  no commitment yet .

  - Someone did a while ago . I know they counted the number of slashes that did nt change but the number of razor s edge increased
- - I bet Toews is like can we please just play ...
  - Just like all the other players  the fans  the announcers and everyone else watching .
- - I am a little bit worried about the Everton though  Sam does nt seem to take the FA cup that seriously
  - Also it s Everton  when s the last time we beat them
- - That s pretty much why it s affecting my gameplay haha .
  - Pretty sure you deleted me I m not offended by it and I would of stopped had you said please stop teleporting to me I m busy
- - Any idea on a timeline for his return 
  - He s aiming to return Saturday . If he misses that  I d expect him back shortly after .
- - That depends on your bill total  how long you stayed for  and how much that server will have to pay out of their tip pool for serving that much product
  - The minimum they can be paid is not negotiable .
- - How long is your SO gone for  E . Oops sorry says missing ... When will you see them next 
  - I am hoping hes coming asap . i miss him .
- - Sunflower seeds will keep you up . As long as your mouth is moving you re not sleeping .
  - Gum  especially bubble gum works like magic .
- - Wonder if its really her step mom ... for science
  - Considering the step mom is latina it would be a rather bizarre twist .
  - Step mom ... not biological . why would it be a twist 
  - This does nt answer the question though .
- - Because it has waterfall  they do nt let you trade pokemons with HMs
  - I have a shiny vaporeon with Dive that I use as collateral pretty often  never had a problem with trading from boxes .
- - this is a super good one  already cooking up ideas
  - Oh sweet haha me too been looking for a reason to use the blender Ivy tool
- - If you ever have a smoker going  throw those in there for some good snacking throughout the day .
  - Yes . That sounds absolutely amazing . Feel like the slow smoking of jalapeno would bring out so much flavor in it 
- - vex  just love the way that thing shoots 
  - Just got a Vex this week . Always had been partial to my Thorns  but ... Dat Vex 
- - Troy looked sooooo slooooooow on that blitz lol
  - He s old and way past his prime
- - Plot twist . He got a new one for christmas .
  - yeah lets give the fatty fatso the benefit of the doubt right 
- - You went into Annabelle with high hopes  How  Lol As above so below was fun but I would nt say it was my favorite of last year .
  - She was notably one of subtle creepier elements in The Conjuring  so you d think they d you know  try to make it scary .
- - I ve already looked at those programs . I really do like them  but those are nt books .
  - What information are you looking to gain from these books  If you like those programs  why do nt you try them 
- - If anything can we filter it out  or make them put it in the daily question thread . I do agree with the OPs sentiment .
  - That s a good idea too . Thanks for covering me before I had my coffee .
- - Jesus Christ . Friend just gave me the scare of a lifetime . Fuck .
  - oh no  Hope everything is ok .
- - Anon loved him  I could nt stand him . He was really good on the PK  not much else for me .

  - I got divorced . Back to the single life for me ...
- - Is it just me or does Connor Cook look a lot like Manziel  At least in his helmet
  - I KNEW I WAS NT THE ONLY ONE THINKING THIS
- - This tells me that this cat probably gets more seriously fucked with off camera . Cats do nt just act like that  even ones not neutered .
  - And sadly because of this the cat will most likely always hate people like that . I hope it sliced the hell out of him off camera .
- - That s understandable . And do you feel it s reasonable to say that talking about what happened may have brought up negative emotions you have associated with that whole period 
  - It is a very reasonable statement  and a highly likely possibility .
- - Redact the private parts  simple as that 
  - Why would that help  people already distrust the police .
- - Question . Is a fast bowler allowed to bowl spin and vice-versa 
  - Yes but you need to inform the umpire  who then has to tell the batsmen .
- - I like how our new QB is the one who threw the pass .
  - Honestly that was the only reason I knew this clip existed .
- - would nt be surprised if he did nt pen this one .
  - Why would a song this personal not be written by him 
- - I wish Iowa meth heads were that nice
  - Oh believe me  she was the rare exception .
- - I forgot how many people I have ignored on RES until I scroll through the dailys .
  - Ahhhh  until my curiosity gets the better of me . Also  I read on mobile so much that it does nt work swimmingly .
- - You know that game only worked half the time 
  - Half   Your set was magic if so 
- - For whatever it s worth  even the President thinks the Lions got screwed .
  - he s the definition of a casual fan . i guess you are too .
- - Truffle Butter is so much better than Only . I wonder why they chose Only over it for a single .
  - Chris Brown hook to bring in a lil extra buzz is my best guess .
- - What s stuck the interior of the cup 
  - Turkish coffee residue  I m guessing . It comes in powder form  so it dissolves very quickly .
- - Awesome  thank you so much for the information 
  - Sure  I d recommend picking one up if you can find one for a good price . also  check out my edit because I highly recommend doing that .
- - Socially awkward includes imbibing too much and getting out of control .
  - Sorry  but I disagree . Most nerds that I know very rarely even drink  and when they do  they certainly do nt start screaming in people s faces .
- - Food makes people angry  What the fuck 
  - Someone made me try a gluten-free  low carb  low-fat cake and I was pissed .
- - Wow she s hilariously bad at anal . I do nt think I ve ever seen anyone that bad . Makes me appreciate my wife more .
  - I think we all appreciate your wife more now ... amiright  everybody  yes  no  my wife does nt give me anal and my life is sad
- - Because he s asking g about the logistics side not the build side .
  - Ah true  I did nt read it .
- - I have the vivillon i think . Its the one with random white and green dot pattern right
  - Its in a cherish ball with OT as GTS
- - Styx . Master of Shadows . Oh god this game is so clunky .
  - Actually liked the predecessor Of Orcs and Men it s clunky as well but the charm in that one is at least in the Storyline .
- - Do your balls hang low Do they wobble to and fro Can you tie em in a knot Can you tie em in a bow
  - Can ya swing em over your shoulder like a continental soldier
- - True  fine I ll give you it  Gromit takes the win  lol .
  - It s really not a bad match up though  the chickens do have the building capabilities and smarts  But I just feel Wallace and Gromit are above them
- - She seems cool . Upvote even if you ca nt meet her plz
  - Very cool  someone fly her to the UK
- - I ve yet to play the game  but grenades seem pretty damn weak .
  - No no no . They are strong .

  - I have it in an excel spreadsheet .
- - Emma Frost  nice to see Marvel acknowledging her existence .
  - She s still a main character in Uncanny X-Men
- - German beer . It s way more complex than American craft beer because they only use the purest  blonde  blue-eyed ingredients .
  - Master race beer is superior to other beers
- - How good are you with the program you used for this 
  - Not very  I only just started using it but I m trying to get a bit better every time I use it . How so 
  - How possible would it be to make logos in the other logos style  Making the PSV logo round and with Eindhoven  like AJAX and vice versa 
  - I would nt be able to do it  thats for sure
- - Why did the video keep going  Bill is just so darn sweet
  - He s telling everybody about how he loves cookies  It does nt quite match up with his mouth but I think that s why
- - You do nt want your American players making a good buck playing in this league 
  - I do nt want any players getting paid amounts that are insanely over their actual worth in this league .
  - So you must not want an increase in the basement of the cap either 
  - No  he does nt want to have to pay overinflated wages to get bigger name players over here .
- - This is actually a nice customer story .
  - I m all about customer service . No seriously .
- - If the Panthers win this game they should thank the soft shitty knees of Carson Palmer and Drew Stanton
  - And we will curse the blitzing of Gregg Williams  defense .
- - There is a time and a place for protest . This was neither .
  - You ca nt be convenient in your protests ... that s the whole point .
- - Excellent point  I try not to use exfoliants in the summer .
  - The sun is still out in full force during winter .
- - i would also like an icon over ally Ward of Dawns indicating the buff . Like the icons over flags but with different symbols depending on the buff
  - I feel like this is much better . I personally like the purple color and that would also make it easier to implement .
- - Between this and the velvetines coming back in stock GOODBYE PAYCHECK 
  - And the new Anastasia liquid lipsticks are coming out tomorrow . I ve really got to rein myself in or I m gon na be bankrupt 
- - Is nt it true that you can install Windows on a mac 
  - or you could just get a non apple laptop in the first place .
- - Fire - the phone that should have been an app
  - I ve read that the hardware is pretty kickass . Apparently there s a way to flash it to straight android and it makes the Fire a pretty solid phone .
- - Only Ghandi could achieve that  and he s dead .
  - I think he was more of a Saints Row kinda guy too .
- - Shit dude that s a wicked setup . Keep using it well .

- - Thank you . I just tried that and I got more detail with Jupiter  but I could nt see its moons .
  - Try building a composite of both images .
- - That s the solution to the Loudness Wars  right there 
  - Wish I had gold to give ya mate .
- - JJ Barea is like the Cole Beasley for the Mavs
  - They re both like a little squirrel that squeezes in your house through the sliding door
- - Under your Lissandra tip . the claw does push you out  flash does nt .
  - If you target your flash in a wall  you ll end up at the closest valid spot . That s how you flash over the larger walls .
- - I think he s still gaming . No 
  - I am . I just forgot to reset my badge .
- - you never know what you are getting out of censor  he s either playing hot or cold .
  - If aches would nt be so greedy and would just give censor a small part of his thumbs they might be able to win .
- - So every time a train goes by all the dirt  grease and other crap is getting all over the food that goes UNDER the train .
  - Oh  you and your first world standard .

- - Yup ... Jones might be the real deal at HW too goddamnit
  - it does hurt  but it is probably true
- - How did you lose them in the first place 
  - I bought a bong and if I m not smoking that  I smoke joints  so I kinda just forgot about them haha . Lost in the abyss of my closet

- - I ve read that chewing on metal can also cause hamster brain damage  is this still an issue with a metal spout 
  - Where did you read that  That s not something I have ever heard or seen but if you have a reputable source I would be very interested 
- - Maybe it s because whenever we get the money to afford a Go-Pro we just buy more fish related things .
  - That could be it haha  I had to stop my fish purchases for a bit  I m maxed out at two fish tanks and two turtle tanks .

  - One shot ESF kills must be nice .
- - Also I was a Colts fan when PFM was on the team
  - Same here . When PFM started playing for the Broncos I started watching them more than the Colts . Now I just look forward to the Broncos games . GO BRONCOS 
- - Probably would try to be an actor  and end up being a serial clown killer instead if it was me .

- - Do you need to tuck the shirt in 
  - I do nt guess so . Better untucked

  - So much this . Just act like any decent seller you ve bought from on the dark or clear net and you re golden .
- - Err ... they mean the same thing  One is an action and the other is the effect of that action .
  - Cause there s a spirit stone for both pass and pass effect . So I was kind of confused . Heh
