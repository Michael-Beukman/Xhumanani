  - Probably not wine in that glass . Was nt the source image from a wedding 
  - Such an indirect route to get to mixed drink because of the glassware
  - In a formal setting appropriate glassware to match the drinks is pretty important . You do nt want to drink champagne from a juice glass for your toast .
- - Sometimes i want a veggie burger with bacon . If the bacon is proper and the veggie burger is fresh it s like having a symphony in your mouth .
  - I always get confused when people order black bean sandwiches with bacon  but your comment has given me some nice insight .

- - They were nt good enough to get out of groups  were they 
  - They lost by one auto attack in the group of death  hardest group at worlds .
- - Out of all of Kentucky  why the fuck would eastern kentucky need fiber 
  - Because most of that area of the state has no internet access . When there s no existing infrastructure why run copper when it s already needing to be replaced today 
- - I got a weird thing but I refreshed the page and it worked .

- - Oh man I was expecting a pop-up the whole time
  - I turned down my volume just in case a wild jumpscare appeared .
- - Why are you just asking married couples 
  - Probably because OP plans on getting married someday and that s when most people have kids .
- - It sounds like you need an emergency fund .
  - While I agree  it seems more like op needs help freeing up the money to build up said fund .
- - Sure they will ft but you re be mixing blue LED light with the led covers .
  - Ideally Im wanting to change to red .

  - i assumed ghost just beamed the different armor unto the guardians and was stored inside of himself as data .

  - When friends lost games I hear then talk about getting minus points on their rank but idk what happens when that gets to the very bottom
- - You do have a penchant for strategy .
  - Haha did you see my chess picture 
- - Is that supposed to be in reference to something
  - upload a picture of this lego set  or is your camera conveniently broken 
- - LINDLEY HAS A PLAYOFF TOUCH DOWN  A TOUCHDOWN  IN THE PLAYOFFS 
  - that is already a victory in itself .
- - Generally if they want to fuck people of the same sex or gender that s a pretty big give-away
  - Yeah  when someone tells you that they re gay is quite a big clue as well .
- - That s probably because most people do nt calm down and take responsibility after hurting someone else .
  - And because most people do nt have the discipline and manners that you learn to follow in the military .
- - So what your saying is  my penis is a USB 
  - As I always know which way to put it in  I d say it is not an USB .
- - I guess I had better get the Dolphin ready by May then .
  - My birthday is in may  its going to be an awesome month

  - He is getting all the cardio he needs by running his mouth like this .
- - Humanity as a whole is nt equal . People like to say so in order to make everyone warm and fuzzy inside  but it simply is nt true .
  - They divided us and won . Whoever they is .
- - I m not talking about who supports Democrats or Obama .
  - Then who are you talking about  Any facts to back up your statement 
- - You re not getting an MMO that is updated with content and connected with thousands of other players . You re getting old games here .
  - But you have more games than you could possibly play . There s a handful on there that I d like to play but never got around to .
- - Really  I did nt know this otherwise I would not have recommended them .
  - No worries I ended up getting a coupon from green man gaming and bought it last night 
- - What the fuck  How does that help 
  - If you re talking about splashing water on me  I have NO idea what her thought process was .
- - Does that use Valve servers or do you spawn a listen server by that 
  - the lobby leader will be host  so make sure the one with the better connection is the lobby leader
- - Bloody hell  that was really well done .

  - Lol dude the interrobang is not some pinnacle of journalistic integrity hahaha it s a little side project of Ron and fez

  - Yeah  aware of that but theres a chance that CIG will coordinate with AMD to make the actual mustang codes expire by february or so
- - Garry s Mod  Skyrim  Do nt Starve - all great games . GMod is IMO a game that every steam user should own .
  - Is CS . S necessary for GMod 
- - Not really . We ve just got results .
  - Bullshit . With the exception of this game and the Stoke game  we have massively improved upon the squad since last season .
- - Do any of you guys know why bravo decided to remove the comments section from them 
  - I do nt  and wondered that myself .

- - Believe it or not I AM a below average player .
  - But are you a below average professional player

- - I ve been using ES File Explorer as my PDF viewer for basic stuff . For PDF Books I use the Google Play Books application
  - Do you know how to upload books to it  I m having difficulty .
- - Could you try to connect the laptop via Ethernet and re-try the download  We could then narrow it down to the wifi chip or a software glitch .
  - Hello sorry for taking so long to reply . I connected my laptop to the Ethernet and the same thing occurred .
  - Hmm . Is your internet pretty stable  do you have any awkwardly closed ports or anything 
  - Yea my internet is stable . Idk wat you mean by closed ports tho . l
- - Los Angeles is the home of the worlds most powerful Jews .
  - Those Jews are just to throw you off the trail of the real powerful Jews .
- - It definitely makes things a lot easier to digest .
  - I was lost until I found it  I wish we had something similar .
- - Does he go on to become a Bond villain 
  - They will name him ... Jaws . Just a guess .
- - cause that will be solved by burning books
  - It s on the internet more often than books .

  - If he does nt go in the top ten it s a shame .

- - I d make it illegal to bribe politicians in America .
  - Because politicians and corporations are notoriously law abiding .
- - A fishy smell is indicative of infection . You should see a gynecologist about that .

- - select the guard  right click in the cell . Otherwise you can use the deployment screen to station a guard in the holding cell at all times .
  - Thanks dude . Also I just got my first workshop and was wondering how do I make them work in it .
- - Apart from security issues it seems ok . If everything were running that all you d need to hack  would be a video camera would it not 
  - And all you need right now is a laptop with some sniffer software  this does nt increase the chances of a MITM attack .
- - I am personally okay with jail being a horrible place . Sorta the point right  Incentive to not come back .
  - There s a difference between being horrible and being inhumane  which Sac County has a reputation of being .

  - Will do  Thanks Clementine  . D
- - To bad you ca nt enjoy some of these funny comments on here . They would cheer you up .
  - I hope I see what you did there .
- - This is the most hilariously ignorant post in this thread .
  - This is the most vapid response I ve gotten .
- - Do you really think that s the case here 
  - Do you really need to be so humourless  Answer the question .
- - Dogs are typically most active morning and evening - I hate drawing comparisons to wolves but if you think about it  it makes sense - hunting time 
  - I suppose . That could be it . SHe s not a hunter type though . She s a pansy little lap dog that is scared of everything .
- - Sorry  but stupid body modification reveals a lack of character . Or at least brains . Or at least sanity . Or at least ...
  - Care to explain how body modification indicates any of those things  particularly anything about character  Smells like a blanket statement from someone extremely conservative .
- - What s better  handlock or control warrior 
  - handlock has more varied matchups  absolutely wrecks some  absolutely gets wrecked by some . warrior is kinda solid and consistent overall . warrior edges out the win here
- - Does it charge if you leave it alone for a while powered off 
  - Yes  but only if it s plugged into my laptop  nothing else .
- - Comedy central offered him a show . Little different then what went down here
  - Jon Stewart is a creator and executive producer of Colbert Report . He collaborated on the creation and running of it .
- - Or you can do the same because you re jumping around in a competitive PVP environment like a kindergartener .
  - Oh  did nt realise this was real-life war . I was under the impression that it was a free-to-play videogame .
- - Awesome progress man  Keep taking these progress photos as you go .
  - I definitely will  thanks for the kind words 
- - Wow  those dimples . You could be a professional butt model .
  - I mean  in a way he kinda already is .
- - That grey stone building would be rather big for birds .
  - Not if they were big birds . Wait  is it Sesame Street 
  - Sesame St does not have this kind of architecture  Has this sub not taught you architecture  
  - Nope . But is has taught me about the letters B and S  and the number penis .
- - I m way more impressed with this as a GoPro advertisement than I am with any shock test . You should send this their way .
  - It s really more a test of the protective casing than it is the camera itself .
- - Am I the only one who thought Dembele was outrageously good today  Felt like his performance has gone strangely unnoticed . Thought he was outstanding .
  - Indeed  you are not . He was excellent today . Honestly  it seems to me that when he and Bentaleb play together in midfield  they do very well .
- - When I get home I will . D
  - what region  NA West  East  EU 
- - I do nt know about all that size stuff  but that sandwich looks delicious .
  - Yes  I need to know where I can obtain this sandwich . I m sure I m not the only one .

  - Generally most games are worth more in the US  but there are some exceptions . Post a picture .
- - His mods would ban you for that . I just do nt think he would personally ban you for that accusation .
  - yeah  his mods are idiots who believe the shitty arguments he makes about the accounts not being bought .

- - Is it just me or did Voyboy not really seem like he was a huge fan of that  but just went along with it 
  - Voyboy is a classy guy . You rarely hear him swear in his streams .
- - I always thought it was Zelda when i first played it ... Not sure how anyone else could nt see that lol .
  - Yeah  I always thought it was super obvious . Who else would it be 
- - I saw a man pick up a male prostitute outside an In-N-Out
  - Is Randy whoring himself out for hamburgers again 
- - Lol this post is all messed up . Updating slowly
  - all the bandwagon cowboy fans finally showed up .
- - I have an egg which matches your TSV  can you hatch it please  By the way  what s the language of your game 
  - yes i can sorry for the late response  I have been traveling . My game is English
- - Okay  what the fuck is it with obeasts and strange looking teeth and gums

- - Just got confirmation that my match got it . Thanks again for putting that on  mods 
  - I m right there with you . I sent out my gift and have nt heard from them .
  - Same here . I was hoping they loved it .
  - Maybe they opened the box and died of excitement .
- - Right after Pat finishes expelling rage by breaking everything in the apartment over Rule of Rose and Evil Within .
  - You ca nt expel Rage  he will expel what remains of you .
- - Like a car crash  I could nt not look but that was horrifying . I need a retinal wipe .
  - The worst part is  I came in looking to laugh at Sunderland and got hit with the Newcastle badge first ...
- - You re a good friend opie . An excellent friend would have also packed some Chipotle Burritos  but that is only reserved for FWB in my opinion .
  - Dude chipotle is everywhere . Only a handful of states have in n out .
- - You can also use certain movement t skills like the rogues evade to get up hills
  - Going to try this  haha . She always looks like she s about to jump and animorph into a panther or something .
- - If it s from within EU  you can bring as much meat as you can convince the border officers it s for personal use .
  - You re right  I checked now . It s forbidden to bring any meat or dairy products from non-EU countries .
- - That is a treat for me as well  thank you 
  - It s seriously addicting . The detail this guy gives is absolutely incredible .
- - I may have missed that ... but why is Orton approaching Punk about the paycut due to the Network related to Cena 
  - Probably because he wanted an actual answer instead of some company rhetoric .
- - You have to be the height of full of oneself to think you re a god .
  - With bipolar at least  some people are genuinely convinced they re God when experiencing mania .
- - And all the creatures of the sea share some DNA with us  based on the same common ancestor . Aliens will be even more alien than that .
  - Agreed  it probably does nt even come close .
- - But the thing is while Christians do nt enact from those verses  sharia law actually does
  - They normally ca nt because we live in secular states for the most part . Look to Uganda and other African countries for a taste of what some Christians do .
- - USS Maine bombing  but that s a long time ago .
  - I m pretty sure there was an explosion but it was the boiler exploding . No one knew this until they explored the wreckage many years later .
- - well you guys obviously did nt have English together
  - They did though ... he just did nt show up .
- - This is Chrono CROSS . The leveling system is designed to cut back on grinding
  - Whoops . My bad . My brain flipped Cross to Trigger . I remember grinding in Cross as well .
  - It s possible  yes  but only until a certain point . Leveling is much more dependent on beating bosses  as all characters get a stat boost then .
  - It s been years . All I can really remember is a few characters and that trying to Summon sucked .
- - They look so creamy  I ca nt even decide which color is the prettiest . Do they seem like they would need a lip liner 
  - Maybe Damask  It was really slidey .
- - I just did a handle where I filled with CA glue  did one coat of Danish oil  and then rubbed some wax into it . Came out pretty good .
  - I ll have to give that a go . I might be making a similar scale for a Spyderco Domino I have on hand .
- - That might have been the worst shot I ve ever seen by Moore just then .
  - I would say thats league one finishing for ya but then MK Dons came to mind lol
- - Liveship Traders Trilogy by Robin Hobb comes to mind . No knights  though .
  - lol Sometimes nights are nt all they are cracked up to be . I will check it out . Thank you .
- - My gods  are we all the same person 
  - I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together .
- - yeah  he s a fighter . But there are better fighters . So he s just in a pool of derp .
  - Like many other carries . So shut up .
- - It s called crab clawing and its a proper way to get kills with the sword in Halo
  - I ... Are you being for reals  or am I getting duped 
- - i think it s a lot more important to get sam biddle to fight mike cernovich . now there s a mouth in need of a fist .
  - I do nt mind fisting Sam Biddle and then opening and closing my hand repeatedly .
- - GiR is not defective ; he is perfect the way he is 
  - IF LOVE FOR TACOS IS WRONG I DO NT WAN NA BE RIGHT

  - Easiest way to fit some storage under a shelf . those are my hippie beer glasses .
- - itt . people who did nt watch the video
  - There was no video when I looked  is there one now 
- - What s that big metal bar across the top for 
  - it s a strut tower brace . it ties the front end of the car together to reduce flexing
- - He was found dead after the bombing ... So there is no evidence at all that he wasnt involved 
  - He was missing for a month before his body was found . There was nt any evidence that he was involved with the bombings .
- - was it cooked already  because if not  he might have given himself a tapeworm or some such .
  - I think the point of ham is that it s already cured and therefore edible as is .
- - Because you do nt negotiate with terrorists .
  - But they certainly do . They negotiated in Minsk . They negotiated for the separatists to check their convoys in Donetsk airport . They negotiate POW exchanges .
- - are you on vacation or a business trip from the US 
  - Business in the US  but close to the border .
- - I m pretty sure I ve never seen any discussion of Vietnam in school that skipped this .
  - Yeah  we definetly talk about this .

  - Nor me . Yet I ve read this far ...
- - Look at all those mouse holes  poor vending machine placement . What a game .

  - Exactly . We have to beat two teams in the playoffs in order for anyone to give us ANY recognition .
- - I will now be putting this game on my wishlist on Steam . Is it a game that i would have to start from the first one 
  - No  it s a pure simulation  there s no story or anything . You just drive your truck all over Europe making deliveries 
  - Sweet . I ll definitely be making a purchase in the near future . D
  - There is a demo version on Steam that you can pump a good couple of hours into and see if the game is up your alley .
- - Is nt it similar to the Chief  Im waiting for the Orca to drop  very awesome looking throw .
  - It looks like a smaller one  ca nt remember off the top of my head
- - Every condiment I can find to cover the taste of hot dog .
  - You need to find a better brand of hotdog
- - That was pretty awesome ; reminds me of the energy in that one famous Street Fighter championship where Chun Li s super is parried .
  - Yeah . Definitely on the same level of hype .
- - Cool joke dude  never stop circle jerking
  - I d be pissed if the best school I got into was ND too
- - That is freaking cute . I want one . I do nt care if it s a vibrator . I want it on my shelf .
  - No one would nt know it was a sex toy  pretty sure .
- - Where was the Sword of Eden at the start of Unity 
  - I think he s talking about the shooty thing it did . Of course that would be a little too OP though .
- - Actually  I knew a lot of writers in high-school and developed a handstyle as well . You definitely recruit a lot of the same skills .
  - That s what I m hoping for 
- - Hey I ve gotten one of those little flowers that wave at you when they re in sunlight . That little thing rocks .
  - I have a dancing turkey . I guess it depends on the items  something simple like that is hard to screw up .
- - Happy Birthday Guardian  May RNGesus leave you something better than a cake  because the cake is a lie 
  - Hopefully he gives me that elusive gjallarhorn .
- - This does nt require batteries . It s more efficient .
  - It also does nt keep yourselves from sticking to the bottom of the pan  or work on thicker stuff .
- - I m so tired of the Bulls playing down to their competition
  - Had the Bulls played down to the competition  the score would ve been closer . Tonight they straight up sucked .
- - I think Mushi will play support  Inflame is their mid player and he is standing in for Demons who happens to be a support player
  - If they want to win  they will put Mushi mid
- - Thats a good way to further radicalize people though .
  - You mean show their true colors instead of pretending to be something they are not ... civilized .
- - Dallas . I m hoping we ll beat them this weekend but if we do nt they have the offense to match up with anyone in the NFC .
  - Defense has also excelled at turnovers this season .
- - Do these dry down to a matte texture 
  - On me they do . They dry to matte and stay forever . I ve seen some people say they dry to a very slight sheen though .
  - Thanks  I ve heard that about them as well so I m super on the fence .
  - I absolutely love them . Theyre comfortable and pigmented . I would get them all if i could .
- - let s shock the shit out of the world . or just have a good game .
  - Even if we do nt win  I ca nt be mad at these guys . They re going out there and trying their best .
