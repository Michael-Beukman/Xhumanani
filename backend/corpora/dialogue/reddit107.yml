  - You ever played Nerf whilst drunk  Its great fun
- - He is nt a like for like switch  but he can provide a physical presence in the middle  much better than anyone else on the team could .
  - better yes but not nearly as effective you can see Giroud win the physical battles all the time whereas Welbeck consistently loses them .
- - If AIMFACE win or forfeit  i will cry .
  - You ll cry a lot more if they win
- - I would say the burden of proof should be the same  regardless of audience .

  - Assumptions here  but if it s like my family  they probably enable him and blame themselves .
- - So if anybody was planning on invading Switzerland  now is a good time .
  - Was going to ask if they should be concerned that the Germans were apparently paying enough attention to it for it to make the news ...

  - Yes we are  however the effort involved is radically different .
- - Try blasting a discovery scanner and then looking around
  - how do you do that  im completely new
- - Oh wow  I ve never seen one of those before . What is it

  - Make an IMPACT  No Spike in ratings  but a new Destination in America .
- - Yes it can  with airplane mode on and such . Of course it would be pointless though .
  - No it ca nt . And airplane mode etc is not what he said he did .
- - Well  I would nt hold too strongly onto Decay being redone . We never know what s up their sleeves .
  - I hear ya  that would be so sweet though 
- - You clearly have no idea if you mistake coke and xtc ...
  - and I feel like two grams of either at one time would be enough to kill anyone but the most hardcore druggies .
- - We already know the message . Do this or else you get your head chopped off  do nt do that or you get stoned .
  - Perhaps this would be an educational experience for you .

  - No paste would not cause that to happen .
- - Why Saisons  I see over over some experiments with Saisons and I wonder why .
  - I think saisons make sense  they can accommodate a wide variety of hop flavors .
- - I do nt know . As a Christian  I do nt believe in some aspects bigger names in Christianity like to harp on . The eccentrics tend to ruin things .

  - I agree with this . Atlanta FC for me
- - I m pretty concerned about the wrong people using this tbh
  - You do nt need this to call anonymously though . It just makes it easier .
- - I love your idea  I need to have a physical version of coach Fiddler ASAP
  - You mean another one in every other pack  You could wallpaper a wall with fiddler . This is my wall of fiddler .
- - Good luck man  Let us know how it goes
  - Updated  actually had a pretty good night 
- - That s actually Kripp  Heh . I always thought that was a photo of some dude that looked like Kripp .

- - I am going to blame any instances of baby brain on this . Thank you .
  - I was hoping it would mention baby brain too . Maybe all this growth in new areas causes lack of activity in other areas THAT I NEED 
- - That thing could have gone all the way to the end zone if OSU did nt stop it .
  - If it did what would have been the call 
- - That shit was lame  so anti climatic . Ca nt even stand and face Cormier . God I hope Cormier smashes that immature  fake  arrogant fuck
  - Cormier is the one who turned his back to the crowd like a grade a stoolie
  - Yeah because Jones would nt face him to begin with .
  - So why did Cormier have to disrespect the crowd 
- - The spring rolls look alright  but what in god s name are the little wrapped turd looking things 
  - They re from Aldi s finest Chinese Mix . Beef Dim Sims .
- - I d prefer a company that shines bright with quality for a while and crashes hard than a company that only cares about the money and releases shit over and over .
  - And who is going to pour all the money into this company to make a game which is nt going to sell well 
- - Of course he knows . They both do . They read this shit whether they admit it or not .
