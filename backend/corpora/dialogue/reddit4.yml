  - It s awesome how well it fits  though .
- - OK why are you telling me this 
  - Because you re involved in this conversation . If you do nt want to participate  nobody is forcing you to be here .
- - The earlier years were a lot of fun . However Ill take the leaps forward in Logistics of the newer years over the nightmare logistical issues of years past ...
  - I m with this guy . You youngins think the porta potties are bad now  They are like temples compared to the olden days .
- - The Southern Reach Trilogy by Jeff Vandermeer . Similar concept  but with much better execution .
  - Bought it and started it tonight  good so far .
- - My New New York just went into production  Good stuff guys  ca nt wait for my ID

- - They landed on the moon before switching over to metric .
  - Explains why we have nt been back .
- - Sailed over new years . The celebration was nice but I should have saved the money and sailed a week later for half price
  - Interesting  my friends and I were looking hard for a NYE sailing this year  sounds like it was nt worth the premium .
- - well if you believe what adnan has been saying all along  adnan barely has a motive to kill have  let alone a good one .
  - I think Adnan has a pretty sound motive . he was very upset with Hae for rejecting him .
- - And I guess EA had absolutely nothing to do with their franchises going to shit afterwards .
  - Which is all the more blame to point at Bullfrog for selling their souls to EA .
- - so ... did you win or not 
  - He won with truesilver the next turn .
  - I m sorry for your loss but you have no idea how good this makes me feel .
  - I was not even mad . That was amazing .
- - Normal weightlifting is like learning to build a house . Crossfit is like learning to use a drill .
  - I m confused  does that mean CrossFit is more focused on isolation exercises or some sort of precision 
- - Quinn s . I can turn into a goddam bird and start flying around clawing other people s eyes .
  - technically  you would nt turn into a bird but be replaced by one
- - dogs and babies talk  retarded fat men are in charge of the household  and we like to fight chickens .
  - Chickens are assholes . It s a fact .

  - The Doctor would never reincarnate as an American .
- - He calls her on what  Hae does nt have a cellphone  she only has a pager .
  - My bad . Ok  he calls her pager and she calls him back .
- - I m refering to the official name given by the International Astronomical Union .
  - Are those the same guys that said Pluto was nt a planet 
- - Do nt you put that evil on me 
  - I think he should go ahead and put that evil on you
- - It comes with the adapter  right 
  - The description from amazon says it does  my puppy chewed the stock one up so I think I need this .
- - Yeah  it makes me think that money is the only reason she s with him and there s probably a lot more that she s hiding .
  - I do not understand why the OP agreed to this  I think given her actions he needs to control the money .
- - And they both faded ... faded ... faded away .
  - They both still have oversized exclusive economic zones though .
- - How many gangbangers in jail  deep down  wish their father did that to them

- - Grass type with Sunkern  Petilil  and Maractus .
  - Thank you  also added everyone thus far
- - Sorry for the lack of clarity  I was nt implying that you said he was evil  I was stating what I saw as the uplifting moral of the story .
  - So much lack of clarity in this thread .
- - yeah  because when he was born they already knew that he s going to act like that xD
  - He started acting like that before he would have been old enough to understand what they were telling him . You ca nt tell a baby who his father is .
- - Have you asked your company if they have a list of places to rent from  often places that have co-ops will have a preferred list
  - They did  but all of them are very expensive  I m looking to make some money to quell the high costs of college so every cent saved counts

- - Indentured Servants were the pilot program of slavery in the US . Lots of them got screwed and they tried to fight back some .
  - Have nt made it to slavery yet . Someday we will .
- - The Templars can do the same  or at least you could as Haytham and as Edward in the first sequence of Black Flag
  - Do nt think Edward was ever a templar  I pretty sure he pretended to be one and you were able to kill a few assassin s in a mission .
- - They should work that way but they do nt . Unions in reality basically work to protect the incompetent and negligent .
  - Only a very few unions are like this . Other unions hate the police and teachers unions for this reason . They give the rest of us a bad name .
- - What the fuck is an HH Gregg 
  - It s a cheaper best buy with less stuff
- - Where I m at in the pacific NW  we do nt salt the roads -- just gravel and sand  so finding no rust vehicles is actually kinda easy .

  - We should follow OPs actions  guys .
- - Would nt the zone extend from the edges of the airport not the centre 
  - Probably but I think we ll be plenty safe there what with all the hills that the plans have to avoid anyways .
- - It d be neat if you could block other players on the line instead of the one with the ball  or the ability to see your entire line s action bar
  - Yeah this one bugged me when it zooms in and you do nt always remember the bars also it would be cool if they put percentages .
- - Supporting is just as bad as committing . Each and every one of those shitbags should be tracked down and prosecuted as terrorists .
  - From a security perspective sure  but the fact that we do nt track them down and kill them is what separates us from terrorists .
- - I was under the impression you could use food coloring as long as you clean the loop every like six months ...
  - It s best to use special eyes made for watercooling loops
- - I would nt give up Davis and honestly Hill is worth more than Waiters
  - But would you take two first rounders for Hill  The future trade value of picks  regardless of how late they are  seems intriguing .

  - I sure hope its not the mumps haha . Oh god please no . I m sure it is nt though . Right 
- - lol and he kept on driving on the wrong side
  - He did nt want to turn around and face the crowd he was trying to impress .
- - If you re going to put a spoiler tag you should really tag it NSFW too to stop the Thumbnail from telling everyone who it is .
  - Thank you . I could nt quite figure how to hide That
- - its spear and auto attacks are also invisible if it throws them from a bush .
  - The spears are really buggy with the headhunter skin for me

  - if OP has any friend who own a vita  perhaps he can try to borrow a memory card to test it .
  - I actually have a few friends that do  will definitely try this out . thanks for the idea
  - You might need to format the card . Make sure they re ok with it and have them at least backup their save data first .
- - alright  just a moment to clone and i ll get back online and trade these ones back to you  do you need any items while i do that 
  - Also  do you want your items back at all 
- - You might be the one that can track down any footage of said hole then . Care to help debunk or confirm 
  - No such luck . I do nt work for CBS directly . I m with another company that works with them during the tournament .
  - So you must know someone then that might point you in the right direction . Ask around .
  - Chances are they would nt let an outsider access their archives  but if I remember in april I ll mention it .
- - It s cool  simple  and good . Nice sword overall .
  - Thanks  It s good to have your feedback .

  - I had all my friends over the night that episode aired  we were screaming 
- - As a Parisian  it s currently a shitstorm in Paris
  - Why  I do nt see anything unusual in my neighborhood . If I did nt have the news I would nt know anything s going on .
- - It warms my heart to see him doing well . It was time for him to go for us but he s still an excellent coach .
