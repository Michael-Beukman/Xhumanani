- - No . It s safe to delete if that s what you are wondering ...
  - Why is it there  I did a new phone restore and re jailbroke with TaiG .

  - That s the third time he s been named ... I think we have a winner  Loser  I m confused ...
- - I support this plan  but how does he stream when he is inside the gas station and making funny jokes with the gas station lady 
  - hm  guess he could hook up a wireless mic to his shirt so when he goes i he does not film  but atleast we have audio . D
- - John Wick was surprisingly fun  even though it was nt amazing but the action scenes were great even though the advertising looked awful .

  - normally my son will ask what I m laughing so hard about and I was getting a story ready but thankfully he was really distracted by golden state stats
- - If they have Internet connections you could use Dropbox . Offline I do nt know of an easy way to do this .
  - This would be the easiest and free way . Another option would enrolling them in free meraki MDM and adding the file to the Meraki Digital Backpack .
- - Much better than Christianity . I did Zen for several years but now I m just an atheist .
  - what is the difference between Zen and regular buddhism 
- - To the savvy internet user  the length of this clip will be enough info to not click on your link .
  - I ca nt see how long the clip is  but using deduction based on your comment I m pretty sure I know what the video is .
- - I did nt like the answer personally .
  - Eh  I m indifferent . I just did nt wan na leave that guy hanging .
- - How about I give you a Meowstic in Pokemon 
  - No thanks  I already have a bunch .
- - You could say the same thing about cars .
  - I m in favor of alternatives to cars .
- - NYPD  like most law enforcement agencies  does not believe it should be subject to civilian authority .
  - Which is hilarious to me as they are still civilians themselves .
- - I think there s a big dumb statue of Jesus on top of a mountain in Argentina  or is that Brazil 
  - Cristo Redentor is in Rio de Janeiro  Brazil .
- - Oh there s upgrades like that  How does those work with insurance  I mean is it for the upgraded chip or the base chassi 
  - Upgrades do not change the insurance included in the package .
- - So how many of these things do I breathe in on a daily basis  Please do nt answer if the number is higher than none .
  - I recommend not answering as well if the number is less than none . The implications of exhaling fairy flies sounds very not cool .
- - Dani Alves sitting on the ground looking hella sad is exactly how I feel right now .
  - We should all sit on the floor until he gets subbed in
- - Once he did the one-handed taunt it was over . Other guy cranked out some one-hand pushups too but he just could nt keep up .
  - those were not one armed pushups  he was just pelvic thrusting  the kid did a couple real ones which is way more impressive
- - I found this sub through that thread too . Fuck this sub is genius . I ca nt stop laughing .
  - What thread was it do you remember 
- - Shiny magikarp is so much cooler than shiny gyrados .
  - I just caught one the other day  My second shiny in all my years of pokemon  I know you do nt care I m just excited . D
- - Damm did not fight like he wanted to be there .
  - It s like he expected to lose and was purely fighting for a bonus  kinda sad to watch
- - I think that gpu is overkill if she wo nt be playing games .
  - Maybe she will be a gamer when she grows up 
- - I always loved the storms  but hated the outcomes . Lightning  thunder  and rain are wonderful to fall asleep to .
  - You re right  the associated things are great . I love a good storm . Ca nt stand that strong wind though .
- - Yeah ... Still do nt do it .
  - Gurren Lagann is not an introductory anime . It s just not .
- - Great . Ca nt wait for what was once affordable education to now go through the roof .
  - How will it go through the roof if it is free 
- - How do you not end up hating one another at the end of the party  Seems to me you guys have some secret formula
  - I would guess they are not immature manchildren .
- - Is nt PoE a single player game 
  - It s like Diablo  so it has PvP and the single-player element is really competitive as you want to get cooler gear than the other guys .
- - Thank you for the links as well very helpful atm 
  - Yeah no problem bruh . Rocky s flow and production is nuts .
- - I do nt need to turn on file transfer personally . It s always been default for me I m pretty sure . Have you tried 
  - Well  no  now that you mention it ... Good point  might as well .
- - Awesome  I thought that processors got obsolete with the growing number of cores  but I guess it does nt matter .
  - im not sure  but i always hear that these processors are pretty powerful for its price and hardware
- - They are nt creatures  they re humans . So was Hitler . People are capable of almost anything . Dehumanizing them is the first step to becoming like them .
  - To uphold integrity one can not fall to the level of the counterpart
- - wow  a bunch of INFPs in IT . interesting .
  - I know  right  It makes sense though .
- - First time I watched porn I just felt like damn  thats what i wan na do
  - More like who you want to do .
- - Not Manuscript  it s Speedball Panache . It s what I started with and still use to this day .
  - Ah okay . Looking at the ridges near the nib I can tell it s not exactly what I have . Definitely similar .
- - I loved that place  just because of how drastically different it was to the rest of Pandora . Every game ought to have a drastically different area in it .
  - And that s exactly why Borderlands . The Pre-Sequel failed .
- - They do it for the tips you fucking retards . I like mine folded if you do nt mind .
  - Disney cruise line cast members do nt get tips from this . It s already in their pay .
- - Novice dart enthusiast here . Those wood  darts look awesome
  - Yeah  wood darts are a lot better than metal or plastic in my opinion .
- - It s worth noting that none of those prints belonged to Jay or to someone on the police database .
  - I thought I read recently that jay was in the car . Prints were not run against a criminal database .
- - Took his helmet off  ai nt that a penalty 
  - I think it popped off on accident . Put it back on immediately .
- - I m on the hind end of this pun train  but I m jump on it .
  - I like threads like this . Nice threads .
- - Provide more context . When did Geass not work on Shirley  If you have nt finished the series I do nt want to accidentally spoil something .
  - I finished it he used geass on Shirley and commanded her to live when she was shot but she did nt obey and died
- - Haha  I know him as well - Knowing him  the product is crazy . Where do you know him from 
  - Long ago through friends  then certain jobs and collaborations with the institute he works at etc .
- - Thanks . Not knowing much about this was bugging me more than I d care to admit . This puts things in perspective .
  - Learning evolutionary biology is a profoundly humbling experience .
- - Those Kara Night Screens seem purposefully deceptive . Ca nt see the scratches on PS that are there on inspection .
  - i can put on different ones  just the map i always take screens on
- - there is a way to gift games  and i have used such a feature
  - I m assuming you mean through the Wii U  right  How do you do it 
- - Were you there for vacation  work or school  Three months is an awesome opportunity
  - Both  actually . One month in Auckland at a language school  then another two months to travel the country . I had a great time .
- - I hope it works out for you  I m just still pissed that my GYN told me there were no side effects .
  - Did nt you do any research on your own 
- - Congrats ohio st. you re back where you were a couple minutes ago .
  - But we now have momentum  a new set of downs AND some time off the clock 
- - So ... is there any criteria for this  I know who I consider the most legendary  but are we looking for great players  iconic characters or what 
  - For the first induction class  I mostly nominated great players who were also iconic .
- - What makes you think these would be quite difficult to fake 
  - They re made from pure silver  Who s gon na try to fake that 
- - He does nt tell you with his voice . He tells you with his fingers .
  - as long as we re communicating brah  freedom of speech and all that ; which is ironically what this thread is about
- - Do they also grumble and moan when you make them move 
  - do they ever  They also just turn into sand bags and do not help you try to move them
- - Bots do nt clear jungle usually anyway .
  - He means for clearing faster and getting more money faster to end the game faster .
- - it bothers me when fatties see my skinny twig self and tell me I ca nt possibly be a mother but that s nothing compared to the oppreshun they go through 
  - Good on you  Wow  that s quite rude . Some people have something called self-control  CRAZY
- - i think the bullet is way faster than sound .
  - Depends on the bullet  but generally they are faster .
- - It s great . Just make sure to build up a big lather before you wipe it off .
  - As someone who whips up a thick lather to shave with an old safety razor  I think that sounds like fun 
- - stadium s in Arlington . Cowboys are headquartered in Irving .
  - And America s team is nt even in America . It s Texas
- - I got my first Satan kill with cursed eye . Tap shooting is a pretty good option .
  - I suppose I should of just started tap shooting . c
- - I ve seen this happen with some other heroes as well  like Zeratul . It negates all damage as well . It s definitely not supposed to happen I hope .
  - I sure as hell hope it s supposed to happen . Little matchup specific devices like this make games way more fun to play and watch IMO .
- - The whole store and that cat still finds a rug to puke on .
  - The Pilgrims were the first to introduce cats to North America .
- - No  it refers to the dish . You re just using the incorrect likening of carbonara to alfredo sauce .
  - I have no idea what alfredo sauce is . However i know that Lasagne Bolognese and Spaghetti Bolognese are different pasta with the same sauce  so ...
- - That ca nt be right . I thought Arrow got the Spartacus actors and Flash got Prison Break 
  - Arrow had Peter Stormare and Robert Knepper .
- - Also I ca nt change manaphys name without it being shiny .
  - K u can make it shiny and ok on the litleo
- - Wow  dude  I live here . I know how we talk in Western Maryland .
  - I lived in Maryland for long time as well . We just have to agree to disagree .
- - I love being able to see the whole movie in just one trailer . Oh and way to show the death of a character in the trailer .
  - Its called the Lazarus Effect  I think that we could guess that this was coming .
  - No I mean a death of another character by the character we figured would die .
  - Oh  didnt watch to the end sorry
- - I would prefer to ask the gym staff than a random hulking bro .
  - Nah  the huge dudes at the gym are almost always the most helpful people you will find there .
- - Doh . That s what they get for leaving people behind  I guess .
  - We didnt leave them  they just didnt want to do red .
- - Imagine that it was all planned for exactly this to happen and then to allahu motherfucking akbar the crowd
  - do nt give them ideas . They have none at all .
- - Thanks for the updates  Definitely keeping along .
  - Of course  Following your progress too .
- - Sounds more like OP is trying to sneak a joke past their teachers in a yearbook quote .
  - Ding ding ding  we have a winner 
- - That s like boasting that a stripper calls you honey . It s purely a business relationship .
  - I think it s genuine . He s one of the few people in the world Obama can talk with like that at work .
- - Ash Ketchum went into a coma after being attacked on his bike .
  - Not to mention the horrifying underground animal fighting ring he was a part of .
- - You re confused  Do you actually live in Texas 
  - Yes and yes . A vast majority of people do nt give a hoot and when you hit urban areas  people support it .
- - haaha  my mom does nt understand why i have them either . I have a good amount now since entering this sub . D but really no space for them
  - I know that feeling . I had to reorganize my entire bookshelf to make room for Smaug .
- - Doubting between gunmetal and cream . Obviously cream only when I ve got a black seatpost  black front tire and better chain .
  - Either would look good but I d vote gunmetal . Would be sick with the black and red .
- - he s on every thread bashing Islam  lol
  - His username makes sense  I guess .
- - Where you on LSD when you drew this  It s excellent .
  - Thanks very much  I was  yes .
- - I just like that they have similar sounding names .
  - I m obviously joking brah  Thought it was funny  Good luck 
- - Aw sheeeeeit  the clock s ticked over . Time to see what happens ...
  - he s been posting too much  got ta wait a minute or two ...
- - Yeah I ll start keeping one of the Lakeside ducks as a pet . Name him Roscoe and feed him cheese .
  - Just do nt take photos with Roscoe in the bathtub . That s how they catch you .
- - That a spider is going to crawl up inside my anus while I m sleeping .
  - charlotte s gettin thirsty u better watch out
- - I think what people do on their own time is their business and people should learn to shut up .
  - Can this be higher in the thread 
- - Does Lion really need more spells that can be sexually misinterpreted 
  - Alright  but mana drain is already sucking someone off ... the reverse would be barfing mana onto people  but if that s your fetish go for it man .
- - I m sorry  but that belongs to me . It was stolen quite some time ago and I am going to have to ask that you return it .
  - Do nt you worry  it ll be stored in a nice place .
  - Can it please be placed it the Titan vault so that I may retrieve it upon its opening 
  - you guys seem to be dropping like flies so i m not too convinced
- - I did nt say any of that  actually . I was referring to the lawsuit .
  - But ... the law suit would lift that grand jury rule
- - Plot twist  the real celebrities do a spoof of this for charity . Cause how awesome would that be  
  - Pretty awesome . I d watch it for free on YouTube for sure .
- - maybe they both have huge dicks . maybe they should swordfight for the karma .
  - Listen  I m sorry that you re upset but I m not sorry for being proud of my dick .
- - The mobile market here gave out free phones too until smartphones came along .
  - We still get free smartphones ... Including iPhones .
- - Zorua and Zoroark are not available in the Friend Safari .
  - oh gotcha  thanks . well will continue adding anyone interested .
- - I would think poor sales would drive price down  that is how you increase sales .
  - Niche products . There s no real way to increase sales when you re selling something only a very small demographic wants to begin with
- - Fucking smashing . Needs more attention  this story kicks ass
  - Thank you so much  It was my first post to SSS . I m glad you enjoyed it 
- - A good option to change one at a time and see what happens 
  - Oh yes  I think Imperial Resources is enough of a change .
- - There is no arguing with you moral nihilists
  - We  personally  I care and I think everybody should  I just ca nt give any reason why
- - I m sure someone can do this sooner  but I ll be there next Monday and can get this for you 
  - Thanks  My father was a pilot for the army  so he really loved Condor Flats .
- - I just finished reading Persepolis today  which relates to this quite a lot . I highly recommend the book .
  - Upvote for Persepolis . Anyone interested in history should read it .
- - Batman s armour is bulletproof  i m sure it will deflect arrows and stabs  whereas their shields will do nothing to combat grenades or the batmobile .
  - Go put on some Kevlar  take a common steak knife  see how effective it is ...
- - Remember when we were a defensive team 
  - Yeah  unfortunately it left with Mike Zimmer .
- - awesome work guys i love podcasts so will definitely be listening at work . Let me know if you need any guests Ill drop in hah .
  - We will most likely look for guests in the future  Keep listening and we will mention when we are looking 
- - Gerbil ate other gerbil . Cat ate fish .
  - Somehow it seems to be a trend for pet stores to neglect to inform buyers that gerbils are indeed  cannibals .
- - Question  does Muramana s toggle work with Eve s Q 
  - No Muramana procs on single-target abilities . Her E procs it TWICE though .
- - I remember this meme being actual advice .
  - Unfortunately for some people this is advice they could use .
- - Saw this one posted on Craigslist  but I have never seen another Park stand like it . Is it an older model or should I be wary 
  - Judging by the clamp it s nothing more than an older model Park Tool stand  you can still find new clamp rubber faces if you need them .
- - You need to back the hell off . She is not available in any way  shape or form .
  - I m actually not the one making moves she been coming in to be more . I ve been trying to to stay neutral because she is married
- - Could it be that you mean sd card instead of sim card 
  - Oh yeah haha yeah i meant sd card dont know why i typed sim card
- - I think we are doing fine in match attendance  we just need those TV viewers .
  - I think his point is relevant for both in-person and tv viewers .
- - But according to them  they did nt break up  right  It was just some rumor that spread around .
  - No  according to them they are finished . But they are death grips so there s a large faction of fans who are pretty sure they are nt finished .
- - Little odd that anyone can just walk onto the track . I m not a big paranoid person  but that seems to be just inviting nefarious types .
  - The track in Montreal is the same way . When there s no racing  it s open to the public  cars too  Though there s low speed limit
- - OoC . I know  and he s missed quite a bit
  - OoC . Like what  Just fill me in with some bullet notes ... I know he is kidnapped or something but what has been going on 
  - OoC . Why are the shadows so popular 
  - OoC . Because I dwell in them ...
- - Next  the lions are let loose for round two of the Winter games .
  - They ll be hungry again in an hour .
- - May I come in please  c .
  - Adding now . Gates will be open .
- - So  that is cool and all . But how long does the battery last 
  - I use the lg r for about two days on a full charge
- - How can Winston read a D when he can barely make out his own sideline  Serious  why is he squinting  What s going on there 
  - I think your coach just had another seizure trying to read your post
- - Good job by the Oilers to get a first from the Pens .
  - Is a first rounder what they really need though  They seem to be actively against the idea of acquiring a capable NHL defenseman
- - Did you go to northern Virginia  Way better than Maryland . Less taxes  too .
  - I was mostly in D.C. and Maryland that week . What little I ve seen of Virginia has been lovely .
- - Well I guess that explains why he wo nt be missing them .
  - Seriously . I would nt miss a cunt like that .
- - Troll  slardar  spirit breaker As you can tell i like bashes
  - I agree with troll and slardar  but sb just seems so solo target and also very predictable that he would nt do very well in a pro game
- - I ll be there but do nt touch my flip phone please
  - Sweet  And do nt worry  I only break my own .
- - Thanks  That s going to be really useful .
  - NP  you should just learn the VGS commands they are really helpful and I somehow miss them when I play other MOBAs .
- - Campbell ... You shoulda hammered that  kid . Wonder if that s indicative of a slight lack of confidence due to very little match time .
  - Doubt it - lack of confidence normally sees the player hitting the ball too hard rather than trying to place it .
- - I d like to say lucky strike  but it s more expensive  worse food and the crowd sucks . So no  not really until south bowl opens .
  - So South Bowl is the same owners 
- - True - we should aim for non-lethal . I was thinking we could just make it hurt the whole time he was dying ...
  - Break his arms and legs and then throw him off . If he survived  trying to swim would hurt .
- - I throw a magazine at your feet . You have an empty gun in your hand . Do you magically have ammo in your gun  No . Quit whining .
  - Then why does it go straight into your mag when you pick it up from the crate  At least have it consistent
  - Because then the best strategy would be to let the enemy get heavy ammo and kill them while they reload .
  - Then you would still have to reload  it would be a never ending cycle of reloading heavy guns
- - I just logged into the Keep from my computer  and it s working fine . Try it again .
  - Still getting issues . Well  at least I know it s probably a problem with my account  since it wo nt work no matter my connection . Thanks 
- - The one that vomits before I ever get to the point where I m wasted .
  - That s the same with me and beer . I can drink vodka all night but my stomach immediately nopes out of the night when I take a sip of beer .
- - but ... no one s asking why snoo is blurry in the third image 
  - It s a glitch in the matrix .
- - Very good selections  I m drinking lunch  Gandhi Bot  and Captains Daughter . Love all three but Captains Daughter is amazing 
  - Captains Daughter was a little sweeter than most DIPA s  but it was still great . I liked it a lot . Enjoy man 
- - And I never knew this . I thought the game got shuttered because no one was playing it . Had no idea it was just a pulled license .
  - It had a small but active player base .
- - At risk of being meta . What is the most aesthetically pleasing question you get on this AMA  and why 
  - Up to now this honor is all yours 
- - Hopefully she wo nt use the leaves to wipe her crimson tide
  - Dunno her hair looks Auburn to me ...
- - nice start  you need more bakuman though . D
  - I know  I ve actually already read the whole thing  now it s just a matter of buying them .
- - yeah but they ca nt read probably so staring at a book is less fun for them than gang bangin  for god
  - Doodley doodley  ding dong  Doodley  Doodley do ... Nathan Explosion .
- - How did this nut job wife-beater ever get back into Congress 
  - When did you stop beating your wife 
- - But what about the cat  How will ever be taken care of  Good riddance ...
  - Obligatory  it s good for Bitcoin ...
- - I d guess there s a post build rule in visual studio that has a copy command . Make sure that the assimp dll is located where it says it is .
  - I do nt understand . Could you elaborate further 
- - It would be the same disaster as IT Crowd and Red Dwarf . Some things just do nt translate .
  - I had purged the US Red Dwarf from my memory before you reminded me . Thankfully  I ve not seen whatever horrible thing they tried with IT Crowd .
- - Her thighs create their very own type of cameltoe
  - I was thinking black hole  but that works .
- - not to be rude or something but someone care to explain please 
  - You might try reading a headline or two today . People were killed in the name of religious extremist for cartoons they drew .
- - If they can eat Taco Bell  they re old enough .
  - There s no Taco Bell in Ireland  does that mean none of us are old enough 
- - But does nt lag mess up both bad players and really good players alike 
  - Sure but a bad player wont know it .
- - I wonder what the repercussions of this event will be in Germany with all the rallies going on .
  - Naturally people will react in the exact way the terrorists want . The rallies will grow .
  - How the fuck do you know what the terrorists want . There was no statement or demands you are just pulling it out of your arse .
  - One has only to look at your answer .
- - Imagine if this was nt posted every week
  - You do nt have to imagine that .
- - Just make sure that Dave Grohl gets his underwear and NO cauliflower .
  - Dude s got his priorities straight ... fuckin  cauliflower .
- - Here s a biased review for you . Stevia tastes like ass . Any time I ve had something sweetened by stevia  it tasted like burnt artificial honey .
  - Stevia makes my mom gag  but it tastes perfectly fine to me . Always found that weird  I imagine it s a gene I m missing or vice versa .
- - I m on mobile so i ca nt really check everything but yeah it looks correct at first glance .
  - Brilliant thank you very much for your help 
- - Damn gurl ... you got ta eat something and do some squats or something
  - Agree to disagree . Some people just have frames like this and it is ok. She s beautiful .
- - Does your exhaust dump in front of the rear tire 
  - It used too . Now it s back out the stock location with a straight pipe back to a racing beat muffler .
- - Just the type of player we could use to push us into a final .
  - Really wish we could get him or Altidore . But I doubt it will ever happen .
- - Hi  I am interested . Can I PM you with details 
  - Yeah give me a PM with the exact details please .
- - None of these networks should be able to make a joke about the French surrendering ever again .
  - You are now realising how pussified American media is .
  - Yes  only American mainstream news outlets are scared . The rest of the world s news outlets are brave champions of free speech .
  - Considering Germany and Danish and French publications will be publishing Charlie Hebdo pictures your sarcasm makes you look like a moron .
- - Finally  we ve started raising the stakes 
  - Yeah . Uranium for uranium is just a match . This is a definite raise .
- - I think that because of the black ice  he could nt steer or brake without him himself spinning out .
  - I do nt think the cammer was even braking  you can not hear the pulsing of the ABS at all until after the hit .
- - Expect more of this all day long . All day long
  - Loving every last second of this . PS  Eagles fan here ; thank you so much for Chip .
- - I honestly do nt think a wink is sexual at all 
  - When in doubt  whip it out .
- - Was it abusive  Where was that said  I m not doubting you  just trying to verify that .
  - You re very right to ask the questions . I edited what I wrote above .
- - Man ... you really do nt like airbags .
  - He does nt like airbags just like no one here ever likes him .
- - NYC . The fact that the world trade center is located there would make it an obvious choice ...
  - The World Trade Center is just an office building with expensive rent . It s not really significant .
- - Calling it now . Ambrose is out until the Rumble where he returns and eliminates Bray .
  - Makes perfect sense . I do nt think anybody would object to it
- - Do nt forget we are getting new home and away jerseys probably in February . Fresh new kit or discounted old kit . Your choice 
  - Totally forgot  thanks for the reminder .
- - In theory  it s a full force face smack to the mat . It s the same force as a Pedigree but quicker .
  - It s the same amount of force as the styles clash
- - Haha of course the straps do nt fit around Crosby s fucking tree trunk thighs . Those things are massive .
  - Hey  as someone who also has tree trunk thighs  that hurts .
- - Nah man he did it to honor his friend who passed away .
  - Good to know but it was just a joke mang
- - In battle your enemy wo nt wait for you to be ready .
  - But you re not my enemy  You re my boyfriend 
- - You do nt stare at it  You take a peak and look away 
  - You fucked up a joke that s in the video he posted . Impressive .
- - Its CUTCO . You work at CUTCO dont you  Just kidding . Congrats man  enjoy the fresh job while you can and keep motivated .
  - Haha  well thank you . I m just thankful to even get a job right after college .
- - See  this happened to me once but everyone thought I was crazy . Only difference is I hit a light pole  not a car .
  - And that  kids  is how I met your mother .
- - i like it lol ... looks like a real rusty knife u can stab someone with and who then has to die a painful death amazing
  - with this argumentation id actually like it though . D
- - It s a fictional movie for gods sake
  - Of course it is . I have an imagination though .
- - After getting lost  he somehow almost manages to start a war by running into some very important people at the wrong time .
  - He can never find his destination but he always manages to find trouble .
- - No . Playing devils advocate . I think there s a possibility he might of .
  - The shot from behind him as he hits it  he cuts across the ball . I think he meant it
- - I think he s confusing feminism with misandry .
  - Nope  they re one and the same .
- - I do nt think these are the instrumentals for Jenny Death . I think this is the soundtrack for Zach s movie . Or just a different album entirely .
  - i really hope so  this sounds real wack
- - He just asked a simple question . No need to be rude about it . EDIT . It seems as if I m not the only who thinks this
  - I deleted my previous comment of calling him out .
- - Lol i did nt even notice the dog on the chair  I was rather mesmerized by your sweet chops .
  - Haha thanks . My pride and joy dem chops are . I stroke them like a villain would a mustache when I think ...
- - were their walls made out of cardboard boxes  look closely at the picture .
  - My guess is that the flattened cardboard boxes would provide extra insulation .
- - Should of invited him over instead of calling him out on it .
  - Yup ... why point him out like there s something wrong with being an introvert 
- - be careful a lot of these are phising links ... do nt download anything untill a mod have confirmed its legit .
  - Oh  yeah sure . I ll PM a mod just to confirm all these links are legit . I just want to make things clear .
- - I love SC  I ve backed it for years  but I m not going to give RSC the benefit of the doubt  and neither should the press
  - RSC  I doubt your claim to be a backer for years .
- - Should have used RasPi with camera and controlled the card by wifi .
  - do you have any more advice of how to implement this  I have the components lying around sounds like a fun project
- - Harris also supports torture  racial profiling  and possible preemptive nuclear strikes . He s a mad dog .
  - That s probably why conservatives tend to like him more than others .
- - It has very nice optics that make the focus at infinity . Its actually less strenuous on your eyes than looking at a normal monitor .
  - Wow I had no idea  I ve never even considered GearVR because I kind of assumed it would make my eyes fall out . Thanks 
  - Nope . It s really nice . Even has focus adjustment dial to make sure you are as comfortable as possible .
  - Are glasses a big problem for it 
  - No . The focus dial means you do nt need glasses . Just focus it until its clear for you .
  - That s great to hear  Hopefully come tax time I will have some dollars on the side to acquire one .
- - You must be kidding . If the guy knew the effects of drinking cyanide would that be OK 
  - Well that s obviously different . I do nt believe diabetes restricts you from alcohol  as long as you take steps to make sure you re okay .
- - It s always curious to go to the shop and see the t-shirt sizes . UK . XL USA . L
  - I ve found them to be comparable .
