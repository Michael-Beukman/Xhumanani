- - Beautiful gun . Stupid question ... Why do i see so many guns without the hoses on the ASA 
  - Maybe removing them when in storage so they do nt get damaged somehow  Just a guess .
- - Swallowing for me but snorting OxyContin is okay since there s not as many binders as Oxycodone

- - blazers need better shot selection and less TOs
  - Not easy . Hawks d is great .
- - Yeah I obviously want to see it too  but I can just see it pissing a lot of fans off and thus getting more people wanting Conor to lose .
  - If they want to see him win or lose is irrelevant  they want to see him .

  - Can confirm  looks normal to me . D
- - Just to be clear  we still hate you Ohio State . But for one night you got to win on behalf of the Midwest . Now go Ducks .
  - We hate OSU  I grumble about Wisconsin  and Texas forever  but not OSU .
- - Why were the parents WTFing if they still believe 
  - They have retained a semblance of behavioral standards .
