- - That is literally the most unrelated  out of left field reply I ve ever received .
  - Since you can clearly read  I m pretty confused .

  - Yeah  it s just the ending that was wonky ...
- - More important thing is which suppliers sell lesser stuff 
  - I just meant I do nt care about taste . I care about it s effects . Both companies have potent stuff  Let me know if I misunderstood . Thanks .

- - Not in the US . Too easy to just bitch . Less effort . Most like that .
  - What about when you guys fought for independence 
  - It s sad and pathetic when you respond . Do yourself a favor . shut your fucking mouth . I could nt be more serious .

  - A lot of times it s done by hand  this is just one way to do it .
- - If only the Olympics had a mental gymnastics category . You would win the gold medal 
  - Yay  I m a winner  I m curious as to why I deserve the accolade though .
- - If your spending is bad there s honestly not much point looking any further .
  - I know that spending will help . My question is what else I need to work on .
- - That requires you to leave mana open and essentially play control . I would love to have some sort of blue Revoke Existence .
  - The rate they are going  just give it a few more sets .
- - All the ones you mentioned are sung in a rhythmic way  unlike USA USA
  - I do nt think the word rhythm means what you think it means

  - It s the fpv version  so I wo nt be flying LOS very often
- - Muslims cant take a joke . She should have known that going into this .

  - who typically gets his minutes  reggie right 
- - Why would not wanting kids make it okay for your wife to cheat on you and get pregnant  That s still a kid to raise ...
  - I kinda meant when the man is sterilised or something . Sorry should have told you . Because in that case you re not really required to stay with her
- - Looks like fun  Where is that 
  - Looks like its Stone Summit in ATL .
- - WarOwls guides are made for silvers and you will stay silver if you watch them .
  - i assume you dont follow him a lot and based all your opinion on one video 
- - Worth watching but spoiler alert  it just kind of ends . A huge build up into nothing
  - Know what else kinda just ends after a huge build up into nothing  LIFE

- - Do we get to pick the person and how we battle 
  - yep  anything goes  it can be water bottle filling to the death for all i care lol
- - There s nothing inherently progressive about this  the concept has existed since forever and moving towards it is hardly something that is fully good .
  - Its progressive for american culture at the time  and i think honesty is better than false vows and concealing affairs .
- - TA is very strong against squishy mids like drow . did u put a point in silence 
  - I did but I still fed . Guess I got countered .
- - Are you running any extensions in your browser  Adblock in particular .
  - That was the issue . You re a clever one  thanks 
- - Hey  listen  Hey  listen  Hey  listen

  - So happy you re happy  . D
- - I d love life if this team becomes a defensive powerhouse .
  - Its fair to say we ll build on our improved D .
  - But how much will you feed on that D 
  - I think they ll make it tough for opponents to really suck up that D  spread their man and penetrate .
- - Why would he want to stop them 
  - Practically Sep Blatter is the agent of Sauron . He is corrupt  against honest football etc ...
- - Welp ... The already astronomical price of Bobby Wagner s future services just went up .
  - I think the Seahawks know what Bobby s worth  with or without this vote .
- - Come on dude  you ve seen me post here before  you know my self-deprecation game is on point . Why expect anything less

  - Just heard it on YouTube a few weeks ago . Lem me see if I can dig that link up again for ya
- - Did you receive yet  I m also an A  and mine was delivered on Friday . I had been kinda worried

  - The only way I could see a joker role to come back is through scarecrow gas
- - i dont agree Debuchy was clearing it safely and was aware of the situation . Szcz simply paid no attention to that .
  - Debuchy took a heavy touch back towards his own six yard box - very difficult to make the claim he was clearing it safely .
- - This is way sooner than I expected  makes me nervous .
  - It s not like they d be required against us right now anyway .
- - I m sorry  she is very pretty  but are those painted on eyebrows  it s really bugging me
  - I think that they are highlighted to make them bolder looking . Not uncommon for women to do .
- - To think that half retarded moron is a heart beat away from being the leader of the free world . Dear God please protect our dear leader .

  - Ahh  but it was relevant . People were talking about TV prices .

- - Next time always have a hard copy of the paper . Or any assignment .
  - The hard copy was on her desk lmao
  - Then you should get your parent to call the school up 
  - My dad has been in contact with the school about the issues with my missing assignment  but he does nt know about these recent developments yet
- - Then people that was going to AFK would just run in circles
  - A lot of them do that anyway .
- - I m with you  The best scarves are good on both sides 
  - I m with you all . I do nt even start to knit a scarf if the back wo nt be attractive enough
- - It was two when I commented . Time stamps man  time stamps 
  - No  it s when three Heathens are nice that Heimdall is to blow the Gjallarhorn  get it together 
  - Might not be your fault . Us Swedes aim high .
  - As Carolus Rex learned the hard way  yes  it would appear yall do .
- - If your pad is big enough to diaper a baby in  you need to rethink your life .
  - If your pad is big enough to smother a baby you should just rethink living .
- - This is why men have a shorter average lifespan .
  - Because we all die from a lethal dose of awesome  I m okay with that .
- - Has anyone ever told you you look like TomSka 
  - Nope . Do nt know who that is . But after an image search I see some resemblance .

  - That is an interesting opinion . No where in my text does it say that I have not been single . I have been single for several months .
- - I won a Harrier jet from a Pepsi contest . My parents bought me so much soda to make it happen I give them credit .

  - Thanks for taking the time to read .
