  - Free as in freestyle . might have made that up myself . D
- - tbh i d just rather councils put a can recycling bin next to a bin in public areas .
  - They do have them  but most people do nt pay any attention and the recyclable waste is contaminated with garbage waste .
- - Atleast you had a chance to explain yourself . I slightly shoulder bumped a girl in a chicago club and was immediately thrown out after she cried that I pushed her .

- - I ve already gotten a lot of helpful advice  but to address your questions specifically  I will experience the popping with no weight at all .
  - Sorry for asking more questions ... Are you stretching after your leg workouts

- - In his defense  Cotton and Increase Mather deserve a little gratitude now and then .
  - Woa  just started watching Salem tonight after figuring out that Lincoln Lee is Cotton ...

- - I d really appreciate that . I felt it was a missed opportunity to not follow up on the guard who came back . Maybe put him on the team .
  - There were a lot of missed opportunities on Alcatraz . Sadly  I guess just too much chaos initially in the development for us to later overcome .
- - It s soul-crushing for the parents  but the kids area at Tuttle Mall is a great place for toddlers to blow off some steam .
  - I feel like I have to put hand sanitizer onto my entire body every five minutes I am near that place  haha

  - waluigi has nt had a game yet you ca nt make that comparison .
  - Compared to Waluigi opposites Wario and Luigi then Link to Toon Link . Their counterparts get a lot more representation then them
  - Toon link is not really a different character  its an art style and is simply a better alternative than young link for a clone .
- - Dude  do nt even click the link  You just have confirmed your e-mail address to all spammers in the world .
  - Could also be some nefarious javascript there  who knows what was in Pandora s Box 
  - is that true that it could be embedded within the link itself 
  - Maybe but generally I d say doubtful right now . Most modern browsers should be better than that .

- - thanks for actually bringing something to the table other then complaining .
  - no problem . This is my favorite place for boxing news and discussion  so I d like to help any way I can .
- - I m genuinely sad that this is nt real .
  - That just turns into booty call situations or creepy guys going over to random peoples houses ... It can go really bad really quick .
- - Sure  that was the original intent  but look at it now .
  - Does nt change the fact that it was always meant to be a living wage . The way it is now is ridiculous .
- - More madness . When will this end  We ve had enough

- - How does this work if one is bound to a chair  Can you still get enough momentum and leverage from a sitting position to snap the tape 
  - You should have researched this before allowing the situation to occur .
- - Any way to make the preview show the face straight on rather than the edge of the cap because the details of the face ca nt be seen at all .
  - I can rotate it so the face faces the viewer  but it ll be sideways .
- - What s a fuck boy   I ve overheard a former fat coworker use the term before .
  - A fuccboi is someone with no common sense

  - I spent the whole promo thinking that he actually looks more like Cena than Cena does these days .
- - Twilight Struggle Robo Rally Last Night on Earth
  - Robot Rally is really fun and easy to pick up . You will curse the moving platforms though .

- - I live in Montana but might be able to make my way out there to watch some games . Company would be great if I do .
  - I m down  man . I have not had a good Chicago sports friend in years .
- - Iguodala s got a beautiful jump shot  at least to me .
  - He s got a pretty sweet rainbow arc that just goes clank 
- - Only the most . They take a loss on CPUs usually so their prices on those are lower but most everything else is a bit overpriced .

- - That was my first thought  No way a fellow black person would upload that ashy ass photo 
  - like for real who raised you my mom would never let me walk out the house lookin like i just got in a fight with a bag of flour
- - Interesting maritime forces . You could be able to send troops invade the Pacific realms of Sveene .
  - Its to stop them from attacking in the water . We have no reason to attack Sveene
- - I m going to pull LL OF It todaY . THAT IS BS AND IT S OVER .
  - I m confused . How did you not know  Is nt it your site 
- - This sounds like some Bugs Bunny toon force stuff .
  - Saitama is indeed a character with toonforce in an otherwise normal comic book superhero universe  played straight . That s the whole pitch of OPM .
- - I live in MA . Some white men are killing it  but white men also are greatly overrepresented in workplace deaths and suicides .
  - Because they work in higher numbers . I m just saying  the white man in America is pretty much as good as the birth lotto gets .
- - Is that a shotgun shell by your mouse 
  - Its a flashlight that is made to look like a shotgun shell .
- - Assuming it s true and they forced themselves on the girls  then the boys involved would nt have been raped

- - Why the fuck are we targeting Dickson 
  - Hes not bad . But ya bad call
- - I ve never seen that on my combat rogue . Are you sure it is nt an error with one of your addons 
  - I do nt use any unit frame AddOns  I only use DBM and Bartender . They should nt effect anything going on with my target as far as I know .
- - I m so proud of you . I m sure that was very hard  but it sounds like it was for the best 
  - I believe in my heart that it was .
- - You should definitely watch it . It actually has a better plot than it might be assumed for a movie in that genre .
  - Thanks for recommending it  I will put it on my list 
- - lol . why do nerds and losers hate athletes so much  jealous much 
  - I do nt hate athletes  I love sports just as much as any other guy if not more . It s just not fair sometimes . That s all .
- - If we lose this game with an anemic offense  what are the chances Shula has a job Monday 
  - He should be demoted regardless of outcome . We were killing it with the run game and then he went away from it .

  - Oh ... Glad I could help them .
- - Thanks for your comments and observations  timely and useful 
  - Thanks for the good job you all do

  - ditto - I m just getting started 
- - This was a UK poll . Doctor Who is far more mainstream in the UK than Game of Thrones .
  - Thats pretty important . In the U.S DW is a nerdy subculture . In the U.K DW is life . I think in the U.S Doctor Who would have lost .
- - On the other things list I would put calorie density . Surprised the potato is nt on here ...
  - Potatoes are a little more finicky to grow than those listed  do nt store as well  plus harvest is WAY more labor intensive in developing countries
- - The guy offered a ride  she said no  he kept following her . How is that not creepy in your book 
  - Did you even read my comment  It is nt about her specific situation . It s in general from the world .
- - Tbf It s kind of on you for not offering him a contract ...
  - Chelsea did offer him another one year long contract .
- - probably not enough if you dont get lucky and get rights legendarys
  - Alright man thanks  do you think i could make a handlock deck 
- - It is when you understand the motion to haul the jury to the Best Buy to see the phone .
  - It would definitely seem likely . Although as someone pointed out  why not just bring in photographs
