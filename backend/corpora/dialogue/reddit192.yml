  - Doing a bane voice as he is folding them most likely .
  - I merely adopted the panty  you were born in it  Molded by it 
  - When I saw one  I was already a man .

  - Yeah you re right . Regardless though  there is an incredibly high number of suicides and murders in the trans community .
- - Is it me or does he have two left hands 
  - I do nt think he left them anywhere  they are clearly still attached to his arms .
- - I know Zionists have no morals -- but murdering children is generally agreed to be a bad thing .
  - You didnt answer the question  how is he worse than sadam 
- - You are traveling through it now . You just ca nt control the direction or momentum .
  - Travelling through space  yeah . Based on the gravity of objects around us . But that doesnt come close to answering my question .
- - Welp  there is a million other people out there like me so I guess you just proved why unskilled report is a good thing to have .
  - I never said it was nt a good thing to have . I just said you re a bit of a twat for having that mindset .

- - As I understand it that s correct . Mainly what I m getting at is that depression is not the same as an emotional response to something that has happened .
  - Definitely . I did nt mean to seem pedantic . I just wanted to clarify to those who not have a full grasp on the difference .
- - Not even the slightest bit  in fact it will only get easier because of the ancient gear  sadly .
  - That s kind of a shame . I enjoy the normal rifts more than the time trial grifts any day . With they could be a bit more challenging .
- - Those are cool looking but are a big stretch to qualify as a coin in my opinion . Looks more like a souvenir .

  - Well  least we know which team wo nt be very popular this year  if this is true .
