  - I doubled checked my setup last night  i was mistaken  I did use a separate drive for my jail .
- - Coulda saved more by not buying that virus .
  - The rebate made the virus save him money .
- - If her son was black he would end up doing jail time .

  - Keeping the HC . We better do something about OC though . Feel like it s gon na need to be another big hire like Pruitt was .
- - He s a pretty bad route runner .
  - Running straight down the field is still a route 
- - it really was amazing watching our players and coaches step it up after such a terrible start . watching vince and kidd still beat that though  imo
  - I felt like last year s team could beat anyone  though . I never felt that about the Kidd and Carter teams .

  - True . You d be pretty reasonable for the Kansas schools .
- - Yeah  if you were born into the nobility or the right race . Things are hard right now  but let s not lose sight of the big picture .
  - Except for a relative handful of cases  that has nt changed .
- - what a fucking loser . rot in prison  you two-faced liar
  - He was already rotting in prison  why do you think he needed the cannabis .
- - I ride as well . Lots of motorcyclists not paying attention or driving defensively in this video ...
  - Driving defensively  Is nt that a good thing 
- - Could maybe be an attempt to lowball some young guys before the new CBA makes them more expensive 
  - Which is exactly why they should turn down that offer .
- - You just seem like a huge tool .
  - That ll be why they can smash a car window with their elbow then .

- - This is a known issue and will be fixed in the next release
  - Thanks thought it was my laptop messing me around haha
- - How about not being a dick to the man who broke his back for decades to raise you  for the sake of irrelevant personal opinions

  - Only after you put it the microwave with the pasta 
- - He has to cool off some time ... right  lol
  - going to keep riding the manimal until does

- - An animated version of this complete with accents would be hilarious
  - Do nt you say those things do nt you say those things to me
- - So how are those live  commercial free  sports programs working out for you on Netflix 
  - Oh noes  what will I ever do woth out being able to live vicariously through other men ... in tights .
- - So many people collecting I doubt they d be worth much honestly . A scalper today probably makes as much as you will selling it down the road later .
  - Basically the Beanie Baby effect . Better to just opened them now and enjoy than keeping them buried in a closet hoping for it to be worth something in the future .
- - Another solution to this is to hide the FAB as you scroll down  and have it reappear as you scroll up .
  - Yeah I think that is the best solution personally .
- - if it was then it should have been nerf then .
  - I really stated that wrong . QF was really bad before the buff .
- - Nothing against my real dad  but growing up with MacGuyver would have been awesome .
  - Your real dad could nt fault you for feeling that way . Nobody could .

  - Oh man  that makes me so happy . . D
- - i never thought Id agree with a raiders fan before  but I do now
  - We all hate the Broncos  and like watching them get embarrassed .

  - Or lift the lid off the back and hold the arm that is attached to the floating part .
- - Already have Foster and Wisdom since ages ago  hope Pulis does his magic 
  - haha awesome mate  hope so too for your sake 
- - Or she watched The big bang theory where Sheldon uses candy to make Penny less annoying .

  - Our ancestors did carry pistols and I do nt feel embarrassed . I feel more embarrassed for you though for being such a smug little child .
- - Yeah  Latias looks nothing like Squirtle  EDIT . And why is Latios trying to photobomb the picture and failing 
  - Oh you know Latios . The attention hog he is .
- - Have you watched him play  He is shit . It is nt a circle jerk
  - Ahja americans with their opinions disregarding facts .
- - I do nt think I ll ever like Fast Lane as a PPV name .
  - Sounds like a bad Aaron Paul movie .
- - Complete bullshit  Wenger denied everything the Sun quoted about him this morning . It makes up quotes and somehow everyone still believes what this newspaper says
  - How can Wenger deny what Podolski supposedly said 
- - So this is a silly question  but these are MMA fighters ... Are these shoot fights with scripted endings 
  - They might be more improvised to make it look real but it s not just an MMA match with a fixed ending  it s a work

- - What happens to her eyes in the third panel 
  - The better question is what happened to her hands in the last panel . They look like they re melting 
- - Not that bad for a highschool kid tbh . If he had a better mic it might be good for somebody with no vocal training .
  - A better mic wo nt fix his timing  tho
- - It s like the whole thousand monkeys with a thousand typewriters thing . If we have nt already guessed it right then eventually we will given enough time .
  - Agreed . I still think Jacques started it all  threw Jon under the bus  and that s what happened . Steam Train was a contingency plan .
- - Plot Twist . It was a red herring to deflect suspicion from his real identity .
  - Plot Twist . The mention of a red herring is  in itself  a red herring deflecting from the possible deflection .
  - It s herrings all the way down .
  - Going down on Red Herring by Chuck Palahniuk
- - Californian here . Not all of us are hippies or surfers ... only the beach bums are .
  - so basically  not everyone are hippies and surfers  just the hippies and surfers 
- - Geoff said that he is based on the betrayer at the end of yesterdays session
  - Cool  thanks . I m behind on youtube vods  lol .
- - I wonder how she killed herself . Did it help the cryptic message make sense 
  - Suicide by standing on the tracks in the path of a train .
- - It would be very entertaining if it got big . I can imagine they stories of sneaky peens and other debauchery in snapshots .
  - It could turn ugly fast as well ... hmm
- - She s his sister ... Foster sister  that is .
  - Whose dad put his away for life .
- - Because theres speculation about everyone going to the leafs . Just ask Tampa .
  - Even I ve been linked with the Leafs

  - Satisfying is when you actually top a major tournament
  - Eh . In a pay to win game  running a deck everyone else already does  it s I ca nt imagine it s satisfying except for the prize
  - Winning with any deck is inherently more satisfying than not winning at all .
- - No I know that  I meant how do you mean it was deliberately handled incorrectly 
  - I m not completely sure what he means  but I m thinking it may have to do with the Obama administration refusing to say it s a terrorist attack .

- - Proof Aches  not sure why replays is on there  this is nt Ghosts  but I agree with the selection
  - Replays is doing pretty good . He has some great snipes and plays very OBJ minded .

  - If madden brings back the final edition I would have no problem with them giving him a card .
- - Hey sorry  most of us were playing DayZ  Oops .
  - Thats ok lol we had a pretty good amount of people joining and playing When do you think you guys will be on next

- - Are actually suggesting that the way to solve gun crime is to have more people walk around with guns 
  - He s saying there s a reason normal people buy and train themselves with guns legally
- - I read that as do nt sprinkle magic stuff on rabbits that turn them into birds . I would have said polymorph but I want to hide my nerd upbringing .
  - Weird  I would have expected a nerd upbringing would have taught you that you do nt hide things by openly taking about them .
- - I m not sure where you re from but I guarantee neither of these are true in Australia .
  - Well  going outside is the most dangerous thing in Australia . I imagine hiding miles beneath the earth can only be an improvement .
- - Now you re talking out of your ass . A smithy is someone who smiths weapons . An irony is someone who irons clothing . Your mother is an irony .
