  - OP do this . Just put a quarter on top of the terminals and it will run out via heat . It will get super hot though .
- - Why is this a thing  like I do nt understand at all
  - I think somebody finally realized that the same people who buy sex dolls are the same people who are into anime .
- - I think the difference here is that he supposedly never had a contract with them .
  - That is exactly the difference  but it really does nt matter as far as the false advertising  claims go .

- - He s gon na need a monocle and a top hat and OBVIOUSLY a bow tie .
  - With proper marketing  this cat could be a threat to Grumpy cat

- - C  D  A  does nt really matter .
  - we talking bout big nips or pink ones

  - Ebay  Craigslist  It s brand new - someone will want it .
- - The sound from video card is just the motherboard sound passing through or there s actually a sound processor there  Windows says it s a device .
  - Correct  the sound is technically being handled by the CPU . Video cards do nt have built-in DACs
- - Not directly you would need like a energy cell or something similar between the different conduit .
  - Buffers were just added to EnderIO I believe and they can be used for this .
- - You probably need to install some drivers then

- - Amazing as always . Love your dedication and how you use the game s language .
  - Thanks . I spend way too much time on the smaller details . You dont wan na open that door  hehe .
- - So I take it it s legal to catch and release the reef fish 
  - It s legal to catch and just take too . Hawaii s preservation laws are weak and the one that exist are poorly enforced .
- - Damn  now I wan na go back to school just to do this .
  - You re telling me you d like to go back into school to show children pictures of boobs  Take a seat over here ...

  - That s the part that concerns me the most  to be honest .
- - Surely you dont need Wayne Simmonds . Let us take him off your hands  But seriously  we could really used a guy like him .
  - NO . STAY AWAY . HES OUR TRAIN .
- - Be honest ... Did you orgasm after that 
  - I had just ran into the mines and was in the process of backing so I missed it . However everyone else in teamspeak basically exploded in their pants .
- - House already looked like the national lampoon house  now he s just being stereotypical
  - He took it to the next level .

  - The struggle was real  I tell you

- - Still need to get the blazer bumper on mine
  - Definitely my favorite cosmetic mod so far . Really cleans up the rear end

  - I remember hearing about that as well . Some pmod getting paid by a gambling clan to mute competitors .
- - He said Boze is in there in the comment  but yes I believe Proof moved out when he was dropped from OG .
  - That is correct . Boze is still in the house as far as public knowledge goes and Proof moved out after he moved from OG to ON
- - The sad thing is that it was the cigarettes that actually made you have to calm down with a cigarette .
  - and that s different from vaping how 
- - Haha  I m kind of surprised that you know what sub I m talking about  but I did nt realize it was your sub actually .
  - . D It was the only one that fit what you said .
  - I wonder how long this conversation can get without using the sub s name 
  - Im sure someone will come by and ruin it . Hopefully it isnt a stingray . It would just kill the whole thread .
- - I guess it s worth a shoot in some scrap piece 
  - Yeah for sure . If you do nt have a scrap of the same material you can just try it out on the back side .
- - In that case just do nt let Jay Cutler be the one protecting you . He ca nt hit a bear to save his life
  - Wow ... Gon na have to remember that one for the wife .
- - We usually lose whenever he grows out a mustache
  - And he shaves it off in the locker room right after the game they just lost . Did it this year too .
- - My brother runs a defender tribal deck . I would nt call it good . But it wins way more often than you would think .
  - Whats its win condition  Does it allows the walls to attack or does it generate a ton of mana

  - is the new class any good  i have been gone so long i am not sure what class to start with .
- - Your terms of service agreement allows you to disconnect without a fee if they increase the rates on you . Read the fine print .
  - I ve never known them to have contracts anyway .

  - Horse is pretty good . If you are going to pass  pass it my way .

  - Now you re Bones  I m so confused 
- - Wow  I wish I had that skill . I would never try that  because I would not be able to pull it off . Damn .

- - Part of me is afraid that this is part of FSU s game plan ...
  - Yup  I wo nt be able to relax until it s really over ...
- - I do nt understand how this theory persists . I ve ranked up after one win . It has nothing to do with wins in a row .
  - Do nt either  just wanted to throw that out there since it seems like a common sentiment around here .
- - dang . never noticed . sweet . about to listen to that
  - I should clarify  it sounds like something Linkin Park would sing  but they do nt . The lyrics sound like something you would hear from them however
- - Shit s all retarded in this sub today . This is the generation next  fuck .
  - Go ahead and link to one post OR comment that you made that is of higher quality in the last month .
- - Haha I think we d all appreciate seeing this disgruntled Cena photo

  - Do you know from the background or is eating whole blocks of cheese just kind of a Spokane thing 
  - Id place her right in front of that goat that eats your trash
  - She s outside the carousel . Goat is a little farther behind the cameraperson .
- - That works as both a likely cause and probable effect of the dog food . Did you close the lid and let them finish sleeping 
  - I closed the lid and went to buy a new printer . They had been chewing on its insides  not worth repairing .

  - He could just send the code to the other guy ...
- - The true King  made monarch by the last true Danish government  William V .
  - Who left his country behind . Where has he been this past decade
