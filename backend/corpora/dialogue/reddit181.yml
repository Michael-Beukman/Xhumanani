  - Christianity as how our ancestors loved it is dead anyway .
- - Haha  Butterfly Effect hate is strong with this one .
  - I m not sure why but the Jurassic Park theme cracked me up .

  - Maybe he saw Run Fatboy Run  Star Trek  A Fear of Everything  or whatever it s called
- - how do you submit a link  the ask for a ditto button is paused ...
  - You have to wait for a Mod to go on so that they can give away Dittos . Then you ll be able to ask for one .

  - Do nt forget about gloves and warm boots  too .
- - That would actually be pretty cool  but then you d have to bring the VA s back in and it would probably cost a bit more ...
  - They have already brought in the VA s back at least once  I remember a few months ago there was some promo video focusing on a bunch of added dialog .
- - That ... did not look like a charge .

- - It was an antler through the throat in the books as well
  - It s another mother whose death occurred simultaneously with her offspring s lives beginning .
- - But penalty yards do nt go down in yardage totals

  - You are incoherent and nonsensical . I wish you had a point so I could insult you more accurately than that .
  - You are only insulting yourself by so loudly parading your ignorance .
