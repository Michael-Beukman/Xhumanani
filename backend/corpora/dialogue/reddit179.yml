  - The miniatures looked so cool  but I could nt back it in good faith  because it did nt look like there was much of a game there .

- - Question . is this an example of native advertising  OP has since deleted their account  it all looks a bit suspicious to me
  - I think it s due to the OP not wanting any of this to trace back to him .
- - You have yet to make a coherent point  what is your point 
  - What s your point  All I see are strawmen .

  - Indeed  so use a comparison between an objects destructive power on its target instead of a size comparison .
  - Um  that s what this is .
  - Then why is it modeled to scale of size  and not scale of destructive impact 
- - I think Bert would be sweating quite a lot there .
  - You can pretend he s sweating by comparing the two images one after another .
- - i had high hopes for him  but has nt really done anything at all
  - yeah  he s had one game where he s played well  but in the vast majority of his appearances for us he s been poor .
- - Do nt worry Bengals . Indy offense will slow down once they put Richardson in .

  - It s hard to tell  but there are markers dividing the two turn lanes . The Lincoln swung wide . The camera car is following the correct line .
- - If it drops back off shortly after a charge like that  it s dead  and it was likely that way before you started .
  - I agree it s probably junk you can try it out but even if it works it will most likely fail soon .
- - You can not set screens out of bounds . George Karl tried this with the Nuggets and got called for a turnover .
  - I do nt completely understand . can you elaborate 
  - If the screen setter is out of bounds and a player uses the screen  I believe the screen setter receives a turnover .
  - Yeah if a player is out of bounds he must establish himself in-bounds before he can interact in the game .
- - I d say it s worse  I enjoy longer periods of sex and changing positions . I like to make my SO orgasm multiple times . We really enjoy the intimacy
  - In that case  I suggest starting to masturbate again .
- - I do nt know how kickers can do that
  - It looks much harder than it actually is . Once you actually learn how to do it it s almost like taking a normal kick .
- - Their website says it s open year-round  but the hours are confusing .
  - Yeh could nt make much sense of it . Might swing by on the off chance .

- - I am disappointed that the Ziplining episode is so low ...
  - Nah  it just was nt funny most of the time .
- - Big RW fan here  I ve been watching since I was a teen . Do you have any reality projects coming up or cool plans for the future 
  - Lots of cool plans  but the networks we re doing them with would kill me if I told you what they were .
- - Actually this does help on console ... IMO
  - Yeah  it s all relevant . OP  pay attention .
- - A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson
  - That part about him researching bear attacks was seriously hilarious .
- - This Jim Brown guy sounds like he sucks .
  - He s only famous for saving us from Martians .
- - You re right  but no one can beat Dendi s level of engaging with fans .
  - To me Dendi seems like a chilled out person and friendliness comes naturally to him . Others have to make more of an effort  which is appreciated nonetheless .
- - Cop cab confessions . the TV show where you confess something in the backseat of the cop cab  then get brutally beat up at your destination 
  - It s like cash cab but way more violent . And less money .

  - This man is asking the real questions here . . P I ca nt believe they named it foxtrot .

- - I wo nt be able to watch this without thinking of him hitting Sandy s boob in Grease .
  - Umm come again  I seemed to have missed that in the numerous times I watched it . When does he do this 
- - Thanks . I was starting to fear that Jerry and Ben were giving us a cold shoulder .
  - Maybe they were just putting it on ice .
- - Your arrogance in the face of your crimes is disgusting .
  - I m so sad you disapprove . Maybe you should seek a UN resolution against me . That ll show me 
- - Do nt click the first link ; set off my anti-virus
  - Huh . Nothing went off for me when I went to the link . Oh well  my bad mate .

  - What model is it  I thought it was the ultimaker bot at first but now I m not so sure
- - Was called a masturbator by a Jesus freak with a megaphone on Orange and Central . He also was nt wrong .
  - I remember him  I got drunk with a priest and we yelled at him 
- - Like as a noun or as an adjective 
  - Oh god  I did nt even think if the noun possibility
- - The kids literally lead the damned out of hell .
  - It was closer to purgatory from what I can recall  with a little bit of the River Styx thrown in .

- - Nice video  dude . Classy  on-point  and informative . I know what I m doing next time I get on 
  - Thank you . Just trying to put out information .
- - Night Train to Terror . If it were remade maybe get rid of the silly dance scenes .
  - I have not seen this movie . I am going to look it up . Another one that I love but is just so weird is A Boy and His Dog .
  - I have nt seen that movie in forever  It s a good one  in part due to the weirdness .
  - I love how they never explain the robot men in the underground city . Oh and you never see the radiation monsters . And the ending is perfect .

  - This makes me like Fisher even more . It s too bad he never won a bowl in Tennessee .

  - Thanks  That s probably really good advice . I ve never been a slave to fashion  Which do you think is the better photo of the two 
- - And people say the AL Central is weak . Pshh .
  - I was incredibly surprised . The pitching really did it for them  their rotation was filled before the AL and NL East even had a single pitcher .
- - I would not want to work on something he did .
  - Some things he does are really good  he s more of an artist than a handyman  but there s been a couple jobs where I cringed .
- - It s a long shot but Blasto 
  - Nope  it did nt have a cartoony graphic style
- - Or what if he has to stir his tea  Use a spoon   Never ...
  - I went to uni with a guy who used his fingers .
- - might want to state that it s EU
  - Yeah I was confused  was seeing comments and thinking this was some kind of sarcasm lol .
- - Spiders . They fucking rid the house of other bugs .
  - These bros are chill to tell secrets too cause I know my girl wo nt ask them for any info .
- - Could you give me a link to your little brother s channel  I promise I wo nt leave any mean comments  I just wan na see it xD
  - He does nt have one . He just pretends to have one . Lucky me
- - Was it more or less sportsmanlike than FSU walking off the field without shaking hands after the game 
  - Who do they think they are the Detroit Pistons 
- - Did you try force closing the pebble app .
  - Yeah but it s only a temporary fix as it s back within a few moments when I do that .
- - I really hated when they changed its splash
  - Huh  I really preferred the new one . Always considered it one of the top splashes in the game once they changed it out .
- - Fuck  I have that I m a Presbyterian Christian on my Facebook profile . I guess that means I m a devout religious fanatic  yeah 
  - It means it s something you think enough of to put it in a profile for everyone to see .

  - First half  yes . Second half  no .
- - hahaha  since when was this a bot 
  - Idk I did nt even know this existed until now
- - We lost them because of an utter lack of the safety standards that keep drivers alive today . It was nt because of drug use .
  - drug restrictions are part of the safety standards .

  - They could have played it on their consoles . I mean the game has been out for more than a year with last-gen consoles .
- - I love Kind Of Blue ... but Kind Of Blue did nt change shit .
  - It s one of the most influential jazz albums ever recorded  and it paved the way for modal jazz . How did nt it change anything 
- - I sleep like a baby after a good exercise day too . Still have apnea and I love my machine . No one is forcing you to undergo treatment though .
  - It s not the treatment I care about  it s the status ...
- - It smells like a scam to me  the whole arrangement . What kind of work were you doing 
  - customer service signing people up for school .
- - Levelling up AND fainting in the same battle seems convoluted enough that gamefreak might try it .
  - Yep but it ca nt be an elite four battle
  - But with the bonus that upon evolving it also revives .
  - Yeah it s like giving a rare candy to a gained pokemon they revive too
- - For a second I thought he was in the entertainment center behind the fogged glass . I have shitty eyes . I probably would have never found your cat haha
  - Same top left corner vaguely looks like a white and brown cat pressed up against the glass
- - That is one ugly ass joint  but it looks exactly like the ones I roll
  - Hey  when it does the job it does the job

- - Check your keyboard  make sure there are no keys stuck down
  - I did I replaced both keyboard and mouse still the same problem

  - Exactly  that s why I appreciated the fact that they made a whole episode about him and his struggles .
- - Do you still have Street Fighter IV Ultra 
  - no  only valid during the winter sale
- - Did not know that  Rocky Top is what I was talking about yeah
  - Cool . Down The Field is our actual fight song . They play it before the EP kicks and then Rocky Top after that .
- - I just noticed there are no Charisma stats  why is that 
  - Well dogs ca nt talk . I ca nt figure how it would work .

- - lol Jesus Christ  Jack . One hell of a setup for a spark joke .
  - Is that what it was about  Haha
- - It ll improve  sure . But I do nt think it ll ever be good .
  - Well that just depends on how much bacon you eat it with .
- - This has nothing to do with luck . Oregon looks more prepared than FSU . There s a reason Oregon has fewer mistakes . Absolutely nothing to do with luck .
  - What  They have yet to score legitimately .
- - Did you soak the brush in hot water prior to your shave 
  - I soaked my brush in cold water .

  - Hahaha . That s the way to live .
- - Is that really Ghostface posting stuff ... or is it more PR than actually him 
  - Lol  definitely not Ghost . Intern at Wu-Tang financial .

  - I think someone who was groomed for the job by the leagues founder would be a better owner than Virginia . Just my opinion .
- - So it s crossfit classes dropping the weight  Do they pay to be able to do the classes 
  - Yes . Either the classes or the club .
- - Oh god  this is SO different than the rotation I m used to . I keep referring back to this mid fight to figure it out  hahaha
  - I fucked up exorcism gives holy power meant to say it does nt proc mastery and hits weaker than judgment
- - Why do you need to rationalize it to practice it 
  - Why should I be nice if I do nt have a reason 
  - Because you want to  or because you understand that if you are nice to others  they are more likely to be nice to you .
  - It really can be that simple . People like to complicate it beyond what is necessary .

  - Yeah that s fine just comment when it s deposited and I ll send one over
- - Do you chip trees off a stem as you go

- - Tibia little honest  not at all .
  - I can never leave these pun threads alone . You always keep me coming back femur .

  - Lol that stuff is cheap and get s me buzzed win-win situation for me .
- - Hopefully this is only temporary  as long as it was illegal then only the rich could eat it so it was a sustainable food .

- - Our passing is off but it might be the ice .
  - i think the ice is melting a bit ...

  - Thanks  but my mom took the vape away  but that s a whole nother story
- - Yeah  what a bastard for putting his health above a game .
  - He said he was healthy in October but just chose not to come back .
- - Friend found out her husband cheated on her WITH ANOTHER MAN . Apparently the other guy did nt know about her and he thought they were going to have a relationship .
  - Ouch . For both your friend and the other guy .
- - That time value was specifically addressed though . Interest rates are too low to really worry about it right now .
  - You are gaining interest on the loans though ...
- - Whatever worldview you want to take it s easily refutable because the origin of your worldview is full of falsehood .
  - The origin of the Catholic worldview is Jesus . The church predates the bible .
- - Removed . You need gray flair or higher to offer codes . Please reads the rules regarding flair restrictions .

- - Jesus  I took a shit  a smoke  then made a few drinks all before halftime ended
  - ESPN knew we all needed a chill break .
- - This is what happens when they find each other in the wild then 
  - This is why they do nt have many packs . They swoop down on the unsuspecting herd  and get distracted by their own brilliance and mistakenly attack eachother .
- - And besides  is nt the point of TRP that men do nt want kids 
  - They want kids . They just do nt want to have to take any interest in them or support them in any way .
- - I tried to leave the pub to see if power had been restored . Had nt . Raced back . Fumble recovery . AB touchdown . I ai nt leaving .
  - No you have to leave and come back constantly  That s the good luck charm

- - It looks like all four wheels are on casters . So where is the thrust coming from 
  - single accelerator wheel in the centre of the base
  - Is it fixed or can it rotate  How could he glide sideways if it was fixed  Maybe when not accelerating it retracts up a little 
  - It s not fixed to the cart . It rotates . Watch the video . It is fixed directly to the steering wheel though .
- - Yes it did . That s why it was such a shitty feature compared to Zealot speed in BW .
  - You realize it passively upgraded their walking speed too ... and you could turn off the charge  right 
- - If it works I think I might try this .
  - You can definitely try this . No harm to your snakes except the ants maybe . Just smear a line around the base of your tank .
- - If I cast defiant strike at effects before damage when it resolves can I still cast another define strike assuming that s the card I drew

  - Awesome . This will finally force me to get on chat for more than four seconds lol
- - you have an electric safari with dedenne and helioptile . need you on PSS for last one
  - I thought it was normal . How odd . Must be because I switched DS s .

  - I m a scum ... Urgot is my second choose if the final champ is banned or picked 
- - Ahh  we have minimal decor at work to make it easier to catch  guppies so far I have found to be the most willing to swim into my net

  - from other people with guns guns never killed anyone  people with guns however

  - Yeah  I ll add you now 
- - I m saving this thread because I also want to know . I ve been meaning to tackle Don Quixote for awhile .
  - This is what the Save button is for .
- - Er  what exactly is a mystery skin  Is it free or something 
  - You get a random skin for one of the champs you own . It s a gift from riot for positive behavior .
- - Yeah  but these people are losers . I really doubt they ll ever amount to anything more than obese pencil pushers waiting to die in their drab  gray cubicles .
  - Some of these idiots have power already . Teachers  judges  and media are infested with them .
- - Sounds good  thanks for the help 
  - np . Hope it goes well for you .
- - Good find on a budget  my friend 
  - This thing is great for college kids  especially . Which makes sense  because everything Target makes is pretty much awesome dorm furniture .
- - Frank Mason has been KU s best player so far this year and I do nt think it s even close .
  - Yep  I think Self benching him for Graham was ingenious  he has really turned it around and is the exact type of point we need him to be .
- - Ooooh . That should be very interesting . I wonder if it s going to get the Premium TD bonus of not losing camo rating when firing near bushes .
  - Premium tank destroyers do nt lose camo after firing  period . This will have that too . Bush  or no bush .
  - Not necessarily true  that was only to avoid nerfing existing premium tanks . Im uncertain this will hold true for new ones .
  - If it does nt  then there will be outrage . Either way  you should nt be firing at things within spotting range in a TD anyway .
- - imagine the shitstorm you d cause putting those on ebay .
  - No shitstorm  after all I have the certificate of authenticity for each signature .

  - He goes over it slowly in the video  it s pretty easy to figure out
- - employees in most businesses get fired for incompetence . you get promotions for corruption .
  - plenty of business promote corrupt and incompetent employees .
- - The girls could all use some of what top heavy girl has .
  - Well this was an appropriate thread for you .
- - Wrong . It is nt defensive pass interference when the contact is led by the receiver .
  - But the contact was nt initiated by the receiver . The holding by the DB is what initiated it .
- - I ll go for them next . What do you think about me having a farming base  Should I leave it at that until I can upgrade my defense more 
  - Yeh man farming base all the way . No point not having a farming base unless you are pushing .
- - P.S . If you re going to a be dick about grammar you should start your your sentences with a capital letter .
  - If you are going to use an initialism  you should include a full stop for each letter or none at all .
- - Ok  that chick is delusional but judging from that pic she does nt seem too overweight .
  - did you see her arms  she is fat but not like wheelchair fat and not a little chubby she is simply fat .

  - A bug is a bug  and it should be patched anyway .
- - Zooma is a tool . No if and or buts about it .
  - That skinny ugly fucker has always been that way . People began to over look it once he started placing well .
- - Great  I m ready to go  Shall we do my town or yours 
  - You can come to mine  if anything interests you in my house  etc . I ll hook it up 
- - Because it s moronic to say that there s nothing to see in the UK . What did you think 
  - I do nt know . I ve given an opinion that it s a boring country . Really  what is there 
- - If you say beer can in a British accent it sounds like bacon in a Jamaican accent .
  - Only if do nt know what a British accent sounds like .
- - You can just turn off javascript in chrome and turn on for websites you trust . it s not as good as noscript but it s close enough
  - my meep would be moot upon your ears .
- - Glad I meet all of the recommended settings  but I m still going to be wary and expect technical hiccups during the first month of launch .
  - They delayed the game two times  it ll be fine . If it is though  do nt be worried .
- - It s because you did nt criticize Israel . Political cartoonists are much more likely to focus on failed policies than about Holocaust jokes .
  - Israel should give up their land to it s rightful owners . Let s see if this gets censored .
- - I have actually never thought about that .
  - Exactly  I had nt either . It seemed like a reasonable assumption  I d just never thought about it from a production standpoint .
- - If he played starter minutes he d be rookie of the year  but he does nt . It s that simple
  - Wiggins is coming along too . I think the rookie of the year is his to lose .
- - Sadly it only gets hot the moment you arrive at work .
  - Does no one start their car to let it warm up before getting in 
- - The second one looks better  but the first one is obviously more practical haha Both are really good  keep it up man
  - I agree  the second one with an optical bay would be the perfect compromise .
- - He s actually dead the whole time .
  - I still have nt seen that movie . Once it was spoiled  never felt the draw .
- - do u train in little rock  my parents live there  I want to go to an open mat next time I visit them .
  - Nemesis is right outside of Little Rock . Hit me up when ya come in town and come roll .
- - Swear to god  this question is posted at least once a week .
  - Probably daily  honestly . Something something all the same bands .
- - the only thing scarier than facing Flacco in the playoffs is a Bill Simmons reverse jinx article . Fuck you bill simmons
  - I swear he wrote this article solely to help the Pats tomorrow  not to actually praise Joe .
- - it must be so cool having your own dedicated fan
  - I used to have a single dedicated fan for a post apocalyptic game I made . We re friends on xbox now .

- - Really wish I had the time to binge watch it all again .
  - Remember  sleep is for the weak .
- - That is how you add music to highlights . Not too loud .
  - Or too offensive . Nobody wants blasting scream metal .
- - I ll be very confused if you gitaxian probe during your upkeep .
  - Upkeep Quicken Probe  Think of how many cards he s going to be able to choose to put back .
- - Bo is fantastic  he s fast as hell but does the strength truck  which saves a lot of time compared to agility trucks .
  - Bo Jackson is so expensive now . Is he going to keep rising 
- - Meeting more people and sleeping with new women . Also  focusing on bettering myself .
  - Hahaha  focusing means you re not doing it . Not to bash  but the first two actions should be enough .
- - THE BANKERS THE BONUSES THE BANKERS THE BONUSES  IT S DISGUSTING 
  - The Tories . The Tories . The Tories . The Tories . The Tories .
- - devils advocate he seems like a real baseball prospect . Those guys make way more money and do nt get their brains smashed in on a daily basis .
  - Honestly  if he choose baseball I would love that for all the gas fake controversy 
- - Do you guys not go to skool or something 
  - I can give you golbat now if you want
- - So many point guard are straight BALLIN  MIP is defiantly Brandon knight .
  - Great call  he s battled a lot of inconsistency struggles but if he keeps making smart shot choices I think he could definitely be a top tier guard .
- - Nothing you have said stops the guy who does that from being a dick  and that is all he said .
  - I know he would have been a dick . But I m just saying that any one of us might have also been a dick too .

  - Your air escorts would nt escorts if they were nt armed  take your equipment and leave or be shot down .
  - I think you are unclear on the definition of escort .
  - I think its you who s unclear  its not an escort if it ca nt protect the personnel and cargo its escorting .
  - Anyway  none of this matters . Our planes are already there  they just can not come back  which is a large problem .
  - if your planes are then how are you having your mini game rp event 
- - I m not sure if it would pertain to this situation or not . But I know that most movies can be uploaded to youtube provided they are flipped .
  - That does nt bypass the law . It just makes it so Youtubes software ca nt detect the movie .
- - I still do nt see or understand how it can work in the first place ... but this so far is the most honest answer I have received .
  - It s literally just welfare  but much more direct .
- - Constantine was a believer in Sol Invictus more than Christianity  yes  I thought SI belief allowed belief that Christ was yet another avatar of SI ...
  - I was actually thinking that Constantine may have been the first to recognize how Christianity could be used for human control .
- - What  you ve never done anything illegal  You re never going to cross an intersection on a red light when there s no traffic 
  - The difference is  damaging someone elses property is a cunt move . Crossing on red when there are no cars about does nt affect anyone .
- - Gamergate is about allowing games to be fun . Those opposing gamergate are just doing so for political reasons . Nothing else .
  - why is gamergate so hard to understand god
- - Smart move  but still an eye killer to me . D
  - I m going to snip them then  Lol
- - Most keys on the keyboard are labeled with what they input to the computer . The space bar inserts a block of nothing and is labeled as such .
  - Ignore all other answers . This is the one .
- - Wow that is a strange sub . I do nt understand what they re angry about 
  - I believe they just hate children . Do nt know why but that seems to be the case .
- - The Northern Union will be boycotting this agreement . We believe that previous events have proven the Banana to be unworthy of such a distinction .
  - wut If you re saying you want one too we can negotiate
- - It makes me mad to see this  but it is genuinely disappointing at the same time that people are this uneducated . And that hair ...
  - I thought the exact same thing . It s not just that he s saying it  sooo many of those people are agreeing . That s scary .
- - Due to the nature of the story  he is searching for a dead body and it must be dead  but I like the mailing idea . Very unique
  - Thanks for the reply  and best of luck with it .
- - Have you tried playing with Netgraph on  I suspect short bursts of packet loss .
  - Yes . My loss and choke never gets very high .
- - How do you manager to swallow one  The only scenario i could think of was babies .
  - An old classmate used them to imitate tongue piercings  and accidentally swallowed them once or twice . Not the brightest student .
- - I m looking for public transportation . If you change the option to public transit it says no routes found .
  - Call the bus company you re looking to use and ask them how to get there
- - Damn he just got blasted off his feet . Must have been intense and he kept filming . He s either brave or very stupid .
  - Often they are one and the same .
- - I never plan carefully enough and they always die . Forever alone .
  - ok that kind of turned sociopathic but that s a good one  so it ll go in the holster .
- - could also not be an official thing  but clearly the guys trust him and turn to him for advice
  - Yeah  could be a possibility . Especially because Crim and Mr X are great friends .
- - Apex . I know Nova is the same thing  but I really hate the Google bar in Nova . Looks really stretched out and forced onto the edge .
  - You can change the size of every widget in Nova  you know .
  - The constant Google bar  There s not enough padding for me .
  - What bar exactly are you talking about 
  - My complaint is with the persistent one  not the regular one . Other launchers have nicer persistent bars  as in not so cramped .
  - There s an option to disable it in the settings  easy peasy
  - I want it there  I just want it to not look so cramped .
  - Remove the persistent one and replace with the normal one after you resize it . Not telling you what to do just telling you what I did .
- - Litigation is a very  very small part of practicing law .
  - Yeah  but what about all of criminal law  That s pure litigation .

- - Looks a lot like guilt to me .
  - You could nt fathom what he s going through .
- - So do it from the actual game . The app should have never been a thing .
  - It tells me as commander i need to transfer ownership .
- - And crimes of adultery can only apply to women .
  - And we ll force kids not ti learn anything with guns that required people to learn things
- - You were saying these people only wanted to go to the US though . Changing your story 
  - No  I m saying their preference would go to a Western country .
- - Any proof you re Russian  You sound like a fucking caricature .
  - what do you want me to make a proof 
- - Dandy s fashion sense is seriously the most horrifying part of this whole season .
  - Or is it the most fabulous part ...
- - Respect to you  I agree . I find it childish of people to break the law and then cry about it when they get caught .
  - It s almost like they forget they are BREAKING THE LAW .
- - Well at least you ve proven you are nt listening .
  - By referring to specific things you ve been saying  Why are you like this 
- - Why are they yelling in English and not Dutch 
  - Theyre speaking Dutch amongst each other . Theyre only speaking English to the pirates . Its more likely that the pirates know a little bit of English rather than Dutch .
- - What rating do you give it over rice 
  - Haha . Thank you for making me choke on my beer while reading this .
- - Let s make a time limit  But seriously fuck the fact that the ASG determines home field advantage in the WS .

- - Comparing http to smb is not a great idea .
  - Well it does nt seem to matter what the traffic is on the VPN  everything is slow . vSphere Client  vSphere web client  SMB  ...
- - excellent point . he could have used a death grip when he was snapping . this could be the basis as well .
  - Agreed  I had nt thought of that but it does make sense .
- - You could play a hell of a drinking game taking a shot every time the word tempo is mentioned
  - Well  Oregon s tempo is really Ducks  especially Mariota with the Oregon tempo . Ducks Mariota  tempo tempo Winston .
- - Standing in front of the mirror and doing the helicopter
  - I would love to do this . I d flap my dick around the entire house .
- - Wow if this is nt the worst video I ve seen this year I do nt know what is .
  - The year is young . I can do worse .
- - You re proving my point perfectly . It s not about Lampard it s the culminating point in NYCFC being s joke club for City to do whatever they want with
  - We knew that from the start though  It s not a revelation that City are the mother club .
- - Why does the bible belt exist  They are nt bombed by anybody .
  - Combination of tradition and the lowest performing schools in the country .
- - This is completely making up for the disappointment that was Oregon FSU  what a great game
  - Hey  I thought that game was pretty great ... . D
- - Great points . It s all inertia .
  - Inertia is a property of matter  the word you re looking for is momentum . Inertia is actually the opposite .
- - Why are you asking us to apologise for something we have nothing to do with in the first place 
  - Do me a favour  go back and quote me from where I said apologise

- - Josh McCown . Fuck Josh McCown . Fuck anyone who s last name is McCown  to be completely honest .
  - I warned you guys ... He was a product of the system .
- - I give up . What is it 
  - Face in the middle on the left side
- - Wow  looks better than that official one they were giving out . Is it actually warm 
  - Its soooo soft and warm  I tried it on for the picture and ended up just wearing it the rest of the day .
- - Has he got a legit reason for selling 
  - Ye he has to travel pretty often in the next months or even years through the country . Guess its trustworthy . P
- - I like it . But why are there a couple of sealed tortilla chip bags and what appears to be a new salsa jar 
  - Because it s a shitty photoshop all around 
- - Op just eliminate Mrs and Mr one night stand . Problem solved .
  - Buy them a cruise to mexico ... permanently .
- - I think its just a compression glitch .
  - That was my first thought too . It s probably the rapid change from dark grey tarmac to the white helmet
- - Because the roles there are much more set in stone  right 
  - yeah  pro players in LoL pretty much sign up for a life-long subscription for whatever role they chose to play .
- - I think it s just a coincidence . Btw be careful on this sub if you re still reading  it s full of spoilers .

- - Those suckers are hard to unscrew sometimes man .
  - Ca nt believe I had to scroll this far down for the most obvious answer .
- - I think you should run roar on empoleon over ice beam because your team is quite weak to other bulky set-up sweepers .
  - I ve been using that Ice Beam mostly just for one-shotting Landorus . Do you think that s worth giving up 
- - I wonder what happens when shit like this is found out  I can only imagine what the convo between Makonnen and Drake will be like haha 
  - Looks like a TON of tweets have been removed now .
- - Cowboys win  there I said it 
  - Are they bringing their own refs again 
- - So basically it s all hearsay . Unless anyone here was actually there when it happened the rational thing to do would be to not pass judgement .
  - Actually  since they arrested the bloke the rational thing to do would be to pass judgement in the absence of legitimate explanation and evidence justifying the arrest .
- - This dude is an ordained minister  what in the fuck

  - Rainbow dash is a pegasus  not a unicorn  and ponies do nt practice circumcision ... and I can only hope they do nt practice gelding .

- - Looks good  Are you doing a review 
  - If people want one I might . Thanks 
- - I have the same luckily but I d probably recommended using the armour piercing rounds . Firefly and explosive do nt work together great if im honest
  - Explosive round kills sometimes rob the precision kill for firefly

- - And this is how my nightmares and Japanese Hentai fan-fiction are born .
  - YOUR hentai  or just hentai in general

- - No game against Dallas . I was hoping we d get one after the game this year .
  - We will in three years  it s a rotating schedule .

  - They were crazy for other reasons  but that s not a bad idea regardless
- - vibes  I hate self absorbed violent people like that . Hope you are doing better now 
  - I both hate and am scared of what that kind of people can end up doing to others .
