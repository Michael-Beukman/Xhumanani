- - someone was lazy and did nt report it  she may suck a good dick but she ca nt do paperwork .
  - Mark from Cuba realky dropped the ball on that one .
- - At this point she ought to just resign . Governor Wolf will be able to nominate a replacement to serve the remainder of her term .
  - Fresh start sounds like the smart thing to do . Doubt it will happen though .

- - i think they still could open by stealthing in or out somehow . The farmers mostly use stealth classes
  - The mob would be right on top of the box practically .
- - Freedom of press does not mean you can print what you want . You need to respect other people . This was just flat out insulting to all Muslims
  - So  Does anyone deserve to die for insulting muslims 
  - No they did nt  but my point is they are definitely not heroes . They are just normal people who printed insulting material to an entire religion .
  - I think what they did was very brave . Heroic  Maybe that s a stretch  but they certainly were nt self-serving .
- - You generalize and call it digital art  which works just fine for almost anything made in photoshop .
  - I ll keep that in mind  Thanks

  - Nope . This is the site for the Bad stink rises .

  - True . We rarely choose the best people for the job  though .
- - talk to him about it  be blunt about it .
  - Thank you . Already talked . I hope we have reached an agreement here .
- - Or you could torrent a robot hooker .
  - Home invasion  Quick  Torrent a robo cop 
- - Evidently there has been some friction between Hogan and HC David Shaw as well as Hogan s discontent with the offensive scheme .
