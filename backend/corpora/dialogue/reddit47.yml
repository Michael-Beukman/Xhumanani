  - Some people have the notion that international internet traffic is all handled by satellites . Do nt ask me where they get that impression .
- - Just because they choose not to participate in a global cartel  they are the villians  Is nt it up to them to choose their own prices and profits

  - Did you just tell me skins and camos are too much of an advantage 
- - It s a basic human right that needs to be honored and protected .
  - I agree  I just do nt understand why people around the world have to be killed for saying something other people do nt believe in . Its ridiculous .
- - Why are they re-using the plastic bottles but recycling the glass

- - Everything is gon na be sticky when they leave . . D
  - No way  I clean like a maniac all day . hahaha .
- - I know I am being a homer but Russell Wilson is more deserving of the MVP than Romo .
  - I agree that you are being a homer .
- - All of that  and he ca nt be sent to the AHL . It s juniors or NHL for him this year .
  - Correct . forgot about that due to his age .
- - So ... Cats in the cradle with the silver spoon ... 
  - Little Boy Blue and the Man on the Moon

  - If I were Caldwell i d send them a picture of my cock and tell them to review this .
- - I was downloading a PDF about how anonymity works on Tor  but after seeing some warning messages online about it I got worried that it is nt safe
  - Understanding of the security of TOR is constantly evolving  I d recommend using forums or other active sources of info rather than a potentially outdated pdf .
- - I remember hearing this a while ago  did a new poll happen or is this just old news coming back to the surface 
  - Old news but I just found it out today ...
- - The amount of posts that are actually against people quitting is mindblowing . I cant believe people like that exist .
  - I agree  why get upset over someone else s decisions that affect themselves .
- - I think that the original audio needs to be removed for that to be funny . I get it  but the cries of terror leaves a terrible feeling .
  - The Hindenburg is fine and dandy with you though right 
- - How do you pick up that flag  
  - this reinforces my opinion that the post season is rigged ...
- - I m not American  but I ve always wondered whether soldiers that get sent overseas view themselves as invaders 
  - He s like a child ... he thinks he s helping .
- - Ok . There was bad officiating I get that . But when you throw the flag and then take it away with NO explanation  then there s a problem .

- - I love you . I just do nt love the Cool Wall
  - Goddamnit this is not how The Notebook went 
- - Literally everything you said can also apply to Harrison Smith .
  - There are several well deserving guys and earl and weddle got it . Probably name recognition that set them apart but my point is that they both very much deserve it regardless
- - First date . Just mention it in your conversation ; I m sure you would talk about your families at some point .
  - That makes sense to me  so this is what I ll do . Thanks for the reply .
- - I love watching someone try to defend a losing argument .
  - Patriots fans do it all of the time .
- - What I do nt understand is do you have to shave your hair over the tattoo forever now  That is some seriously dark and thick hair on the edge there .
  - Its fairly common practice to continue to shave a tattoo . I know a few tatt d up dudes who shave their arms
- - I m going to have to disagree with you on that .
  - It s not a matter of opinion The majority has been racist throughout history The majority is racist today The majority will continue to be racist
- - And she still said it s not enough .
  - She wanted two months salary  not the whole world s money flow .

- - pretty surprised that an Asian tourney has prizes for every spot
  - Still have a pretty heavy top prize pool .
- - Plus less Delly time ... he s been way off his game lately .

- - Move your feet - Junior Senior  You ca nt not like it  i dare anyone to disagree . D
  - I ve fuckin loved this song since the first time I heard it 
- - You mean on the draw  right  If you re on the play  you re giving your opponent a free card .
  - Yes . Not sure how I mixed that up  manaless dredge and choosing to be on the draw are pretty much synonymous .
- - do nt want to put a laptop on that . A rasp pi would be perfect ...
  - A pi would take years verifying the blocks
- - Hipsters every where are going crazy for that outfit .
  - Guns are bad . Hipsters do nt like guns
- - I think they ll get a notification but wo nt be able to see the answer
  - I d rather they not get a notification at all . . S
- - I m pretty sure Garen and Lux are brothers
  - I thought they were lovers  and Kat was Garen s sister . Mind blown
- - It is natural . That is how flight control works .
  - Yeah I ment to add except flying games . I wonder if people who use inverted controls invert the inverted on flight simulators .
- - you re probably pooping out all your electrolytes . keep that shit in balance .
  - Possibly . That one has been more recent now that I think of it .
- - Seriously  There are mostly other talks right 
  - I personally hate scammers and I am going to refrain from going since Moe ca nt do his due diligence before allowing Josh Garza speak .
- - Jesus ... that seriously was the most fucked up story I ve ever read .
  - You should check out the letter of the killer Albert Fish  that one might be a close second

  - That thought honestly slipped my mind . Sorry 
- - Sell it  save up for a PC .
  - I would  the problem is that my parents gifted it to me  so I cantt just sell it .
- - This guy s entire channel is quite good 
  - plus he s got the exact same taste in games as me .
- - I posted there first and got nothing but condemnation for this very reason . I think advice from people of a more traditional perspective would be greatly valuable
  - I took a look . You were hardly condemned ; they were just being very honest about your situation  which seems to not have a solution other than ending it .
- - That better be red ink or paint or some shit . Otherwise you re a sick fuck . Also if it is your blood  please stop and seek help .
  - It s his blood . I can tell by the instrument used and the way those letters are placed .
- - No interruption to crucial tunes while managing to wrangle some prime delicious treats ... you have a blessed Sunday on your hands .

- - Who cares  this position is a joke .
  - Everyone else in this thread cares . Any more obvious questions I can answer for you 
- - Sweet are they gon na catch up to Nintendo and Sony and make a handheld 
  - I do nt think so . I mean Nintendo is greatly in the lead for portable devices . Xbox is going to have to try extremely hard for that market .
- - Of all the weird looking enemies they made for starbound  do nt think this was expected to be there . Nice .
  - Are nt enemies procedurally generated from body parts  I did nt think they d manually made each one by hand .
- - Everything from SourceForge is unfortunately bundled with additional crap . The site needs to die .
  - not true . publishers can opt-out of this crap
- - Warriors is just simply the better gig and probably offered more money too .
  - His Family lives in Cali and he has worked with the GSW execs before in the past .
- - Congrats on being sooooo fierce  But no product list  Reported .
  - Haha I imagined a product list for a trans and came up with . Bewbs .
- - can you try to make skull face look like the yellow bastard 
  - I can try . Which image would you like 
- - I still hope you reported it so they can not participate in future exchanges and offend more people .
  - I keep meaning to but is hard to navigate on mobile . If I remember  I ll do it when I get home tomorrow
- - I would nt be surprised if the presence of sniffer dogs actually increase the probability of someone overdosing .
  - I feel like the greatest risk factor in overdosing is consuming narcotics which make you overdose .
  - I feel like you probably do nt have much real life experience with drugs
  - I m not wrong . Sniffer dogs do nt make people overdose  people consuming too much drugs do .
- - Is that the fish face you mean 
  - Thats the first time i ve laughed all day Thanks .
- - I JUST BOUGHT ALL THE CARDS FOR MY NEW BLACKWING DECK OFF TCGPLAYER AND I JUST WISH THEY WERE HERE ALREADY . I WANT TO PLAY .
  - I KNOW THAT FEELING . I M IN NEED OF ALL KINDS OF CARDS AND NO ONE AT MY LOCALS HAS THEM .
- - Now at the end of this scene  does Jim realize he s being an asshole and actually hurting Dwight or does he think he s wasting his life away 
  - Just thinks he s wasting his life away . This is right before he moves to the other branch iirc
- - You are one ignorant  racist asshole . People like you are the problem with America .
  - Yes  anyone who hates Nazis is a racist . Well done .
- - The tootsie rolls act as a fast digesting carb for me post workout sometimes . But most people probably see it as just candy ...
  - And why do you need a fast digesting carb 
- - careful  not all of their fears are unwarranted .
  - Yeah djinn are hard to kill on Supernatural . Rams horn  who has that 
- - good fun playing with you tonight man 
  - You too  Lots of wins even if I was failing with the ARX .
- - What the fuck are you even talking about  Twitch is making money OFF Qt by cutting half of the subscriptions he receives in half .
  - He also gets money from twitch thanks to the ad revenue .
- - YOU WILL BE EATING HUMBLE PIE COME SATURDAY .
  - NAH  I M THINKING ABOUT HAVING SOME CHEESE NEXT . THERE S TOO MUCH SALT IN THESE BIRDS .
- - There might not be a lot of Raptors flairs in here because Canada is playing in the World Juniors right now
  - I think there s more than enough Raptors fans that would rather watch the Raps over a junior hockey tournament
  - You d be surprised . The ACC has been sold out
  - Toronto s a huge sports market  hockey dominates it but there s a huge portion of Raptors fans that are hardcore basketball only  me being one of them
- - Curly fries  man . Curly fries .
  - And nacho cheese sauce on roast beef  Mmm .
- - Seoul  South Korea or maybe Lisbon  Portugal .
  - I suggest you choose the better korea 
- - Also Starkiller from the Star Wars Force Unleashed games 
  - And the wan na be ice truck killer from season one of Dexter .
- - Not the only huge thing she has ...
  - Her dining room table  I think it fills the space well .
- - ah thanks  i was completely confused because you called it FN . D
  - It s just for the lolz . . P
- - You should cut the entire nose off  not just a bit  for the books sake .
  - Heh  that was my first thought too ...
- - Ugh . She s probably just PMSing . Us dudes have it so tough dealing with their weird hormonal outbursts .
  - Thanks bro  Yea  we really do  haha  I m trying not to beat myself up cuz I know I did nt do anything wrong .
- - I do nt think they are native to India .
  - I m always amazed at how little of the English language people actually understand  but this takes the cake .
- - Why use workstation AMD cards for gaming 
  - because i forgot that titans could be sli in the moment and that the titans do nt have enough display ports to power the screens .
- - Weird  snapchat forgot to inform me that you screen shorted that . Slackin off  snapchat .
  - It was the story  not the original message .
- - Holy shit where do I buy one of these 
  - Will be released on next player sponsorship .
- - One of the best imo  you can easily see all of the members in their greatest moments . Had this as on my lappy s desktop for a while now .
  - Shame its not a higher resolution or I d do the same . To the internet 
- - It s actually quite fun  I did however get to the point where I was getting two Pokemon appearing at once  rather than just the one .
  - I thought I had solved that  thanks for telling me . I will look into it .
- - Im American and still want to answer - tipping .
  - Pizza driver here . So minimum wage is not enough to live on  and we make even less than that . We rely on tips to make a living .
- - It s hard out here for a pimp
  - When he tryin  to get this money for the rent .
- - Really  It s bad enough they do nt let you have guns over there  but they do nt let you have bullets  either  Weird .
  - What are you going to do  Throw a bullet at somebody really really hard 
- - Max brooks agrees that this is the best gun for a zombie apocalypse . Mentions it in the zombie survival guide .
  - I completely agree with his assessment . When it comes to zombies  quantity and mobility is important .
- - Two weeks usually . A little before if your hormone levels tend to be higher . But morning after pill  I hope you re okay .
  - All the stores here are closed on Sundays  including pharmacies .
- - Still though . I guess the customization is cool  but I m not much of a fan of the game .
  - No problem  thanks for the response .
- - I ve found some . It s right next to the elbow grease . Bloody stuff s in metric though .
  - Do nt forget the headlight fluid while you re there .
- - I think this person means something like replace Edmonton with X so as to say  it can happen anywhere .
  - He should have used x   though . n  is usually a variable for a number only  like a sample size .
- - Drake is being played . That makes the Raptors more powerful ... right 
  - it ai nt chef lowry with the pot
- - I was in favor of trading him if he did nt clean up his act and to be honest I did nt think he could in Dallas .
  - I do nt know if they d trade him because he s very good offensively if he can stay out of the box  but if the trade was good enough
- - Are you looking for a full-time position 
  - Yes I am . I go to school at night time .
- - Your comment is exceptional . Thanks for those great words of advice .
  - It s my pleasure . Thank YOU for taking the time to respond . Happy New Year 
- - Its the Computer Science and Software Engineering frat
  - I m guessing that nobody knows it unless they were in it . Be aware  the HR person who throws your resume out very likely is nt even an engineer .
- - Dibs on ... Ruby  I m not a girl but whatever .
  - Dibs on Nora ... I m also not a girl .
  - Crap  Blake left . Uhhhhh  I ll be Neptune  since nobody else will .
  - Taking one for the team  good on ya mate
- - My Korean gf likes to take a big sip of water  then feed it to me through her mouth  kinda similar to your fetish 
  - Yep  that d be fine with me 
- - She looks so uptight she probably has a similar sized black one at home
  - It s the ones who look uptight in public who end up being the biggest freaks in bed .
- - Put out a nice meat and cheese platter .
  - I got enough cheese and crackers for eight people . Do you think that s enough 
- - I think so as well . I was never special in any way
  - That kind of dedication is special . Your grasp of light is  at worst  way above average .
- - I d kill for an Iggy amiibo .
  - Same for Ludwig  Hell  all of the Koopa Kids 
- - That s a really small number of arms to be moving ... even as a side gig .
  - Probably selling to small sets of gangs in Chicago
- - Tiger stripes . Wear them with pride 
  - And that kids  is why my toned arms look like a fine oak cabinet .
- - does it also apply when you check the valve clearances 
  - If you do nt change anything it technically wo nt need it  but if you re at a valve check interval its probably a good idea to hook the gauges up
- - I ve seen them in Apple stores .
  - Awesome  will have to go this weekend ... thanks 
- - I just want to say that every time I see a post from you it s like getting a present . Your voice drives me wild .

- - Is he still managing Alberto Del Rio 
  - That s Alberto El Patron to you sonny
- - Let s talk about a real issue here . I m not a big fan of that dress .
  - Her face reminds me of an actress but I forget what her name is or where I ve seen her
- - I assume so . They ca nt afford to have fewer players than before 
  - Hope so  thanks for the quick answer 
- - They ll call an ambulance for you and you ll have to sit there and convince them your back does nt really hurt anymore .
  - Now why would I even think of doing that . If my back hurts  My back hurts .
- - drafted without hearth arena lol this is gon na eb intresting .
  - Same here . I m recording it so I can enter them later .
- - What do you guys do to keep motivated in solo seshes  I really dont want to quit but I just have no interest in another session alone or bored
  - Find long roads  listen to your favorite music and skate them  progress .
- - You actually do nt sound like you ever worked for Apple
  - I did for two years . I was a contracted worker for AppleCare at the Boulder location .
- - I use them because my hands do nt need to leave the keyboard .
  - neither do mine when I use iTerm on Mac tmux instead creates a lot of problems with scrolling  term colors  vim themes and shell shortcuts
- - Agreed  the few times they ve collaborated I wish they d done more collaborations .
  - Also agree  I ve really liked the few times they ve been in the same videos .
- - If these allegations are correct  this is very sad .
  - Why would you pay someone to play DOTA for you  The fun is in playing it yourself 
- - when you say cancel out calls  what do you mean  what actions were taken by the dispatcher 
  - I think he meant like not accept calls from this number .
- - Not to get into hockey  but we are nt Edmonton level bad ... haha
  - Uniting in the misery of another Canadian team is always a good time .
- - Will and Grace was a great show .
  - It was fun for a while but it never really developed into anything more .
- - WE DID IT FOR YOU PAUL JOHNSON 
  - Now we do nt have to here about the sec for a whole year 
- - It does nt really matter what Cohort he s in . Being Augur I have different duties to attend to . I m kinda outside my Cohort duties now .
  - Sorry I am kinda new to the vocab around here . Care to explain . Treat me like I am dumb .
- - take a day  get naked and do anything that crosses your mind .
  - yup Just explore each others bodies  find out what you and her like . That alone makes things so much fun .
- - Dress  like you re going on a date with yourself .
  - Clearly a low cut top is going to happen .
- - Mine has nt confirmed his either  yet has sent a letter and stuff to me .
  - I had someone PM him  to ask if he s received it . He s not replying  but his account is very much active .
- - Why would nt that cause every dwelling to be maintained worse than from absentee slumlords 
  - I m afraid I do nt understand your question .
- - Will you need status immunity on both of those 
  - That evil Frosty with a lot of HP can spawn in either levels  so I d recommend bringing a status clearer along .
- - Oh man  I can already tell this is going to get complicated .
  - I m having fun  This was a better idea than I originally thought  I already have an intricate story line in mind for a few people 
- - You do nt cut a starter when there s no proven better option on the roster .
  - I would nt cut Johnson though until I signed a Big Time FA LG .
- - Is the dog Bill from King of the Hill 
  - That s Stephen Root  and no . Reynolds voices the dog and cat .
- - HOW DO YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE SOLOED THE NIGHTFALL  DO NT WORRY  THEY WILL TELL YOU .
  - I HAD TO SOLO IT BEFORE HEADING TO THE CROSSFIT GYM . I DO CROSSFIT .
- - Im seeing like a really sparkly shimmery champagne  or cream shade on you 
  - LOVE sparkles so I m glad to hear that 
- - The door holding cartoon is eerily accurate . Lol
  - True  I ca nt argue that .
- - Use the draw strings and tie them up to make sure they do nt fall down 
  - Oh they were tied . I m not that foolish .
- - to call the entire league a retirement league is harsh but there is no denying that the most successful teams have relayed partly on very old players
  - And that s why the perception of the league is that it s where aging Euros like to go to get fat and collect easy checks .
- - It s really bad for your skin to do that . Also heaven help your hair if you shampoo twice a day .
  - My skin has never been as good as it has been now since i started showering twice a day and who the hell shampoos their hair twice a day 
- - It is because of some hanging chads .
  - I know Chad was a dick  but did yall really have hang so many of them  You could at least cut them down now .
- - Looks like a weird stained glass heart vagina .
  - to me  you just won this thread
- - Did JV get hurt or something  Seems like they would want to exploit the Center position against GSW .
  - Warriors are running way to much for us to use him on D
- - or maybe try not to recklessly endanger yourself and others next time  edit . punishment for speeding exists for a reason
  - I was joking about the last part but  k
- - Damn  I did nt see that part . Seems disproportionate now .
  - well  what did you see when deciding to post this
