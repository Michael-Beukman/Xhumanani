  - It s not BioProtect but i ll try clap . Why would that cause it though 
- - I would burn the shit out of myself if I tried that
  - Thats sorta of how you learn to use those . You will smack yourself in the head or legs a few times with a burning thing if you re not careful .
- - So when this is done  where does the ink actually go 
  - I m pretty sure some of it is absorbed by your body gradually after the laser treatment .
- - Sorry to hear the makeover did nt go too well  but what new products did you discover 
  - A new NARS blush and lipstick that I liked  She also used concealer as a highlighter which I had never done before and I thought that was pretty cool .
- - this post man  is actually art huh  this formatting is just what this anxiety feels like haha
  - also  looks like OLE but its not .
- - Ca nt believe I got scared at that . Good job 
  - I was about to question why you were scared until the video made me jump ... I peed a little .
- - Hmm  I agree  but i feel as if that s something people should be able to realize without traveling abroad . But most do nt I guess .
  - I agree with your point . People can realize that in different ways . Traveling is just one of those things that can bring that conviction .
- - Murder via child neglect plain and simple  now go crawl back in whatever crazed religious racist hole you came from .
  - PC thought and speech is a mental disorder
- - did you also not have plans this new years 
  - Maybe he s from the future ... I mean  Australia .
- - I do nt why do nt you tell me .
  - I do nt trust you . I also do nt know you . Can you please leave it alone 
- - You can contact Apple . Good luck with getting a reply from Google 
  - That s true . As an iOS and OS X user I m definitely spoiled as far as customer support goes .
- - I d love to see this style for other weapons . Looks really good  I do nt usually rate skins but now I felt somehow obliged to give my opinion .
  - Thanks man  I ll definitely do a couple more in this style  just got to figure out what weapons would go well with it .
- - So now nobody can go bowling in North Korea  What a dick .
  - I mean  nobody can eat either . Which is worse 
- - I just thought it was a cute name for dog backpack ...
  - Magic Jesus  you have cute names for everything . D
- - Is kerb an common alternate spelling of curb or just a typo 
  - kerb noun a stone edging to a pavement or raised path .
- - Its sarcasm no  Or am I confused on what satire is ... Someone help me
  - No  you re right . Or is it more sardonic 
- - All games are repeatable but you get none of the rewards .
  - Well the item set is repeatable so I just figured maybe you could pull those items from packs or something 
- - I took out the physical ram and replaced it with downloaded ram . Much better
  - I m a strong independent computer  who does nt need no RAM .
- - I have to know  why is she keeping her uterus 
  - Jews believe that their entire body needs to be buried . She s to lazy to dig a hole  so in the freezer it sits .
- - Hey would you trade that for a shiny lugia 
  - No thanks . Sorry but I like my new Giratina haha .
- - That price is definitely too high for me and I do nt think I would ever feel motivated to pay for it .
  - Just out of curiosity . Do you go to the theatre often and how much is your local ticket 
- - Could you please tell us your glorious mod list  so we can enjoy GabeN s mercy  Am I GabeN enough 
  - when i get home from school i will post it
- - IDK  I quite like tanking like a lady  . P We can hit just as hard  you know .
  - Did nt say you could nt ... but even ladies can go man mode  xD
- - if you re white you ll probably just be murdered and your body dismembered and sold for use in black magic rituals .
  - Bullshit . I still have friends and family there  they are nt being hunted for body parts .
- - Call me crazy  but I think she kind of looks like a cross between Mila Kunis and Anne Hathaway . I m okay with it .
  - I actually find that to be a pretty good description
- - heat of the moment post man but you re right . you guys and a couple other teams could have pulled it off as well .
  - Haha yeah I know what you mean . That freshman WR for Baylor was electric .
- - Go to sounds on control panel and make sure your headphone output is set as the default
  - Already did that . That s not the problem . The headphones are connecting fine but no sound comes through
- - Is the second bit from that film about the tire that kills people 
  - I know what you re thinking of  but it is not . I believe it blows up people  actually . The second gif was on the front page recently .
- - That s an interesting looking tuxedo kitty . You usually do nt see the white face like that .
  - Sometimes when I look at him I see a white cat wearing a black hoodie .
- - Well I ca nt test my motherboard without a processor .
  - I ca nt use my processor without a motherboard . For quite a lot more than a few days .
  - Just buy one and then return the one they send you to the place you bought the mobo from .
  - I m sad to say I ca nt afford to do that . I do nt have enough money .
- - I did like it  but yeah  the authors interruptions really did nt gel well with me .
  - Glad I m not the only one ...
- - This is incredible . I would totally try this if I had any coordination with a paintbrush .
  - Do what I did and find a friend who is talented . Way more efficient than learning painting yourself .
- - Bipolar  scoliosis  herniated discs  ED . Also  it is cold and I hate cold .
  - Bipolar here too . The mania is nice sometimes but the depression sucks almost always
- - The sad thing is that he probably believes his own bullshit .
  - In my opinion  he appears to be senile .
- - Dude  this is just amazing . Great skin 
  - Gon na have to parrot this comment . Great work .
- - Seems like they are all just trying out eachother s sports for their reality show thing .
  - Get your logical conclusions out of here . Klokov has betrayed us .
- - I was nt trying to imply anything  I just wanted to know why you felt that way .
  - Ah  gotcha . You must have commented before I edited in the reasoning .
- - Porters are generally sweeter . I ve heard that the name stout originally come from stout porter which was a stronger and therefor drier version of a porter .
  - Russian Imperial and milk stouts are quite sweet . I do nt think associating strength with dryness is correct .
- - Another way could be to just make acid blocks work on bedrock above the bottom layer
  - This is by far the best solution IMO .
- - Im pretty sure burlap  I watched his progress through pictures on Facebook . Absolutely astounding how it all came together
  - Huh . He must have sculpted some kind of mask that he actually has the burlap glued onto so that it holds it s shape like that .
- - Was just able to log in again . Hope the network is back up for you too .
  - I just checked . It s up 
- - I imagine they have to do lots of things like hiring actors and writing scripts .
  - Actors  ha . Scripts  hahaha .
- - Out of curiosity . what was the story that you pitched to New Scientist 
  - Now you re testing my memory . It was about a new design for skis . Seriously .
- - I wish I lived somewhere there were areas like that .
  - You dont  I promise you . Bleak desolation does not a happy person make .
- - So why do nt we interpret it the way that brings a discussion  since we ve already looked at what happens if it is nt the commercial version .
  - Well go ahead  although we can also make a discussion out of how to interpret it  which is what we ve done . D
- - Shit I guess I ve been complaining for no reason then .
  - You should try complaining about how poorly your team played ...
- - I love that OP thinks we do nt understand how much a trillion is .
  - When numbers get that large they really do nt make sense to me . OP was being helpful .
- - Cause Jesus he knows me  and he knows I m right .
  - Cool . Could you ask him about that second coming thing  I ve got a bet with someone I d like to take care of .
- - Nah  she d still have tits .
  - Men can have tits too  you never seen Ray Felton with out a shirt on 
- - One and done seems to be the motto these days . Probably not worth getting excited over . Am I doing Hurricanes hockey right 
  - one of us . one of us . one of us
- - Good Will Hunting was the only movie that has genuinely moved me throughout my life .
  - I think I need to watch it again alone in a darkened room . I was surprised by how little it affected me .
- - My bad . When I asked my friend who s an Austin native she said it was Lady Bird lake
  - Does nt sound like a native to me ...
- - Feminism . tell women to be afraid when they otherwise would nt be .
  - Fear is a very effective method of control .
- - Not trying to be rude but you need to give those things a quick cleaning bro
  - I understand bro  they re my beaters . I ve never done a real clean on my shoes before  what s the best way to do it 
- - I agree with you totally  I was just being silly .
  - Oh i miss read it a bit lol  I see what you meant now
- - Shit  I had a class with that guy . There goes all we learned .
  - I like how that hit was so big it took away both your knowledge .
- - And he was nt admitted that was the issue . Had he been he likely would still be alive .
  - It s possible . You d really need to see the medical records .
  - True . From what I know  the doctors were extremely negligent .
  - Yeah  I could see that being a definite possibility .
- - Was he drunk  That could be it .
  - We split a bottle of wine  but I did nt really feel it so i forgot about that aspect .
- - Backed . I ve entered races before simply because they have a cool medal .
  - As a newbie runner  how do you know what kind of medal you ll get  Or if there even will BE a medal 
- - That makes me wonder . Would we still kill and eat animals that could talk 
  - Probably . If they talked all the time for no reason .
- - Micro transactions in games and in app purchases .
  - I love no more ads  in app purchases .
- - Could nt just move them to the top or front of the band 
  - I m not sure why they did nt to be honest . But they were cool so it did nt matter too much
- - Pretty eyes . Even if a girl is heavily overweight  her attractiveness doubles for me .
  - That really is inexplicable . Being attracted to pretty eyes is so uncommon 
- - Is nt China also riding a massive population bubble that s going to turn geriatric pretty soon  Ditto for Japan and South Korea .
  - Yes  they certainly are . Unfortunately  when it pops  China still wo nt be nearly as rich as the other two .
- - Take videos of me playing with my self and sucking my boobies . And sell it .
  - I was expecting there to be at least one post relating to this .
- - pretty simple but very helpful change especially after voting requirements changed
  - My thoughts too . I d been contemplating this change  just stalled on doing it .
- - Monk would figure him out easy  but Dexter would kill him . I agree .
  - Dexter ca nt kill him . Does nt fit the code . He d be paralyzed by the two greatest rules of the code  just like he was with Doakes .
- - And today is the day I clicked on a link to listen to a guy tell me he pissed his pants .
  - It happens to the best of us . No wait  I mean just weirdos like you .
- - Before the movie  I only knew Iron Man existed because of the Black Sabbath song .
  - That song is not about the superhero .
- - Austin is not nearly as liberal as anywhere in california . Its not mich different than any other major city in texas
  - Lols Cali has some very conservative parts .
- - Looks like concept art for the Hunter bar under the hangar
  - Yeah  it looks a lot like it actually .
- - What  if anything  would you say you learned from your experience with an older woman 
  - I think the most I learned is dont take anything for granted and be happy about who and what you have in your life .
- - Drop an HE on the stack for maximum luls .
  - Did this in mm once ... make sure there are nt teammates nearby
- - Stay high  like all the time ...
  - to keep you off my mind woooOoooo  woooOoooo
- - Aww shit  that blog is awesome 
  - I love that blog . I enjoy that they do nt make a stand for mras or feminism  they just reverse some extremes of either side and let people discuss .
- - Rocket Man  Smoking all this weed up here alone 
  - And I m gon na be high as a kite by then .
- - Is nt LAN less competitive and basically easier 
  - It s the same thing as NA till Diamond I and higher from what I ve heard .
- - Moral policing . Sharia law must not be too far from your comfort zone .
  - Being free to choose who you want to hire is moral policing and similar to Sharia law  I ca nt believe I fell for this stupid troll attempt .
- - Thanks for showing me the most autistic thing I ll see all day
  - Aside from your comment  you mean 
- - I was nt making an argument that you should have no job . I was saying not taking a raise to avoid going up a tax bracket does nt make sense .
  - I never said anything about not taking the raise for jumping up a tax bracket though .
- - I got the Badger  a legendary scout rifle . Thanks Bungie 
  - Awesome Scout Rifle . Love my Badger ... What perks did you get 
- - it would never work  too many different nations and cultures .
  - Actually that s hardly a problem  cultural diversity is not actually harmful . The true issue is the vast difference between Europe s economies .
- - The original Howling was good . I pretend the rest do nt exist .
  - The Marsupials installment is my guilty pleasure .
  - It was ... unique . I do nt think we ve ever seen werewolves in a pouch before .
  - Definately have nt seen them give birth before .
- - If you use a peasant phone . iOS works fine .
  - Peasant phone lol  Are you the Master of the Lake from the Hobbit 
- - I watched some of it live  I was hoping the resulting projects would be available somewhere .
  - I think they re still working on storing the backups online . In due time .
- - As if it does nt do the same thing all day long .
  - Right so do you want that compounded on top of what you marinated in all night  Nasty .
- - im scared to click this . i think it s staying blue .
  - It s ... interesting . From a purely educational standpoint
- - According to some stats Strootman seemed back against Udinese  but how was he really playing 
  - a shadow of his former self would be the short answer
- - The WGA  Oh yes  the World Canadian Bureau .
  - Windows Genuine Advantage  you get free movies if your copy of windows is legit .
- - The tits  That s all I m seeing .
  - We do nt know if the rest of her is any good . She could be huuuuuge .
- - Very cool . I got a similar perkin knife from my parents this christmas too .
  - I d never actually heard of them before but they have some nice stuff .
- - Cook  why are you out there if you do nt want to block .
  - He looked so confused . Maybe he thinks Baylor players have cooties .
- - How much do each of you weigh 
  - I m glad you asked this . I needed to know too
- - More importantly  why does nt a Starbucks not accept NFC  Starbucks is one of the tech forward companies and they are onboard with apple from the get go
  - Probably because they are one of Square s premier customers . NFC payments would discourage people from paying with Square .
- - Porter Robinson . Worlds is an amazing experience  roller coaster of emotions and even better live . I dont know why it received such mediocre scores
  - I think it s because it brought nothing new to the genre . But  I agree  some really good songs on this album .
- - I m okay with cops because I do nt do dumb illegal shit that would cause me to hate them .
  - You do nt have to break the law to have a bad experience with the cops .
- - I like Neil deGrasse Tyson  but that suggestion is fucking stupid .
  - How hard can shutting down a computer be 
- - Tagged he will win the thread   do nt let me down .
  - No  I already talked about it . I m done . Feel pretty good about myself actually .
- - What type of pedals are you looking to trade for the Compression 
  - Only od I m interested in would be small sound big sound f od . Not likely any other ods . Aside from that maybe delays . Anything weird
- - and yet  some people still give him credibility
  - I ca nt even break down the stupidity in your comment ...
- - Nice setups  What desk is that 
  - The desk that killed the IKEA Galant . RIP Galant .
- - What s the fucking point  then 
  - Great question . I think everyone would be fine with just calling it .
- - Yeah  they d be highs and mids .
  - dude I feel like I should hire you as my friend xD
- - I do nt even know how people do this .
  - More patience than I could ever dream of having . I could nt even practice that much let alone put my practice into use like this . Quite something .
- - Ya but we ve got better looking women and martian beer is watered down .
  - Yeah but we ve got better looking beer and the martian women are watered down .
- - This makes me feel an array of emotions .
  - I finally understand what people mean when they say an emotional rollercoaster  .
- - Also maybe it should be in the Audio Units folder  not VSTs 
  - If it s a dll it s windows  so no audio units
- - Let s all quit  Let s quit today  It will glorious  For a while ...
  - I finished my probation period a week ago . LET S DO IT .
- - If I want to bring a gun that shoots cars to a wedding  I m damn well going to do it .
  - Your other comments are canned and ridiculous IMO  but this one made me laugh  so there s that .
- - The next promo will probably start like tommorow  so just hang in there
  - Trying to . I just cant believe how many packs can b bad in a row sometimes . Its crazy
- - And so many times Ive wanted to execute a big minion  but instead did a zero dmg shield slam .
  - Why do warriors never make this mistake against me   
- - I guess he s never been to South Texas . The fattest  ugliest of Mexican men have the ability to hook up with the hottest women . It s crazy .
  - It s called being a drug dealer .
  - That s only in the movies and on TV .
  - I live south of you . I ve seen it .
- - Maybe you guys should have sex outside .
  - Seriously . Take him backpacking or something  pick a nice spot well off the trail  and just go to town . Something tells me the boyfriend will love it .
- - I do nt think it s possible anymore . Now Motiejunas has bulked up a lot more  enough can guard Rolo . Which means we can put Dwight on Aldridge .
  - If Dwight is stretched out to cover LMA doesnt that mean Wes and Lillard will be doing layup lines with nobody able to rim protect
- - This actually looks pretty good . It s disproportionate because of all that engine in the front  but it s done really well .
  - No engine in the front . It s mid engined .
- - Dude - It s Tracey Ullman  Of course it s a silly cover . Am I that old  It s her show that originally launched The Simpsons  FFS .
  - Duuude  I m from Germany so I have nt even heard her name
- - Arin s rage after Ross shows up in Battle Kid . Just punching the shit out of the couch off screen .
  - I always imagine him punching Ross instead of the couch ...
- - Since I ca nt watch the game right now  I am curious - How is Kohli s field placement 
  - I think it was good the first hour or so  but been ordinary since .
- - Whos upset with MM  Everyone Ive talked to seems perfectly happy
  - People you have nt talked to  apparently ...
- - Kinda like the obsidian studded weapons of Mesoamerica 
  - Just saw your comment after I posted this  It totally does look like that .
- - That might be the meetup I am thinking ... Although a specifically decimated conor show WOULD be more ideal
  - Agree . Though I m not sure decimated means what you think it means .
- - Wait which road has the stop sign  I need to know which driver to be angry at .
  - There are no stop signs  just right-of-way rules . It s not in the US .
- - this is what happens if theres people left on one side if not then its more of a problem solved situation
  - I think you should slit your wrists today .
- - why would her defense team try to appeal 
  - Because they may be able to push for a mistrial .
- - Have nt accomplished something in a long time  Just play the Devils 
  - At least they did nt score ... right  Oh that game was painful .
- - Jericho vs. CM Punk was wildly underwhelming .
  - Mania was but I thought the match at Extreme Rules was pretty good .
- - Why does it cost a time out if the clock was stopped  Edit . thank you Mike Trico
  - By rule if there s an injury inside two minutes it costs a timeout
- - That was awesome . I felt like I was sitting in the beach myself and watching the sunset . Really cool melodic and chill song .
  - Thanks a lot  This is exactly the situation in which I came up with this . Whenever I play it I am transported back to this evening at the beach .
- - In my opinion  the winner should be the one who outplayed the other person . Making the person who was outplayed the winner is simply unacceptable in a competitive game .
  - Why is a suicide inherently outplaying  It s only outplaying them if you know it makes them lose .
- - Let s be fair here  neither side will claim victory if this conflict escalates .
  - True  but only one would still be standing in the end .
- - He has his filter on  it says blue shit . Also we are done with that research now .
  - Yeah fresh install  this was the first thing I saw when returning to the game . I was very surprised to say the least
- - I want carroll to stay . Do we need Bony 
  - How many strikers do we have that score goals 
- - It s certainly a brilliant anime but I feel like the references and the slow start might be a turn off for newcomers . Generally newcomers are better off with action shows
  - Generally why FMA . B is number one because it combines being an entry anime with a decent narrative for veterans .
- - Damn  Sabretooth has waaaaaay too many abs .
  - Yes . A female version would have a pair of pup feeders for each of those rows of abs .
- - Imagine the panic and confusion that s running through this ducks head as he tries to understand what s going on .
  - I was told there would be liquid ice here 
- - Dude  some one put all your stuff on the wrong side 
  - I think his camera is upside down .
- - In the future  please remember to post the appropriate system in the title . You ll have better luck forming a group if guardians know what system you re on .
  - Thanks I m newish to this and it s late I dident realize I for got to put that lol again thanks
- - Oh I m a mobile user so I do nt see those buttons  I ve always been a mobile user so there is quite a few things I wo nt know
  - Apple or Android  There s apps for that 
- - Is there a cum shot somewhere in there  Hot video ...
  - Do you  or anybody else  have a mirror 
- - The Penguin only hangs out with other supervillians  so Jerry Jones makes the perfect best friend .
  - If christie is the penguin  what is jerry jones 
- - You had a crush on a cheerleader s locker 
  - You should ve seen how much this locker had blossomed more than the others . You would ve been all for it too
- - Added  can i add you as well 
  - Sure . I ve added you now .
- - Shadow of Mordor is a good example of this .
  - Ehh I could nt even finish that game because of the horrible story .
- - It s your life  your choice  but no amount of genital mutilation is going to change your chromosomes .
  - Chromosomes are nt the issue . Taxpayer funds for elective surgery are the issue .
- - So cute  Mine would probably do that moments before slashing my throat out
  - Not this guy  if I do nt pay attention to him  he starts knocking things over so they land on my head lol
- - I get it  flair  CARbink .
  - Apparently  my joke was so bad  OP had to delete their account ...
- - Requires August Celestials exalted ... Can you ride it  
  - Not yet im working on that rep now
- - This Habs team is blowing my mind ...
  - Yeah  this was our best overall performance in quite a while .
- - You made the map  thanks for your time if you did .
  - No  I did not make it . I just peeled it off the source of the AL article that had it sized super small .
- - I still think Henderson wins  it s just my opinion though .
  - It s cool  I just wanted to say that it would nt be the same kind of match-up cause of Alvarez  stopping power .
- - Ha ive been on that ride  wasnt a fan . I wonder if insurance covers fucking flying people launched off amusement park rides .
  - That seems like a really inappropriate thing to do to someone seconds before they die .
- - Eh  you re not making weird mutant babies if it s in the ass ...
  - Certainly not with that sort of attitude .
- - Chelsea  What . You have obviously not followed soccer for that long .
  - No I know they have nt been good for long  but now that they have so much money  they are nt going away any time soon
- - Chocolate . In my defense  it s the only flavor I ve had .
  - That s the only one I ll drink .
- - Should ve used Mons instead of Pokes  because Mons has one syllable .
  - Is Pokes pronounced with two syllables  I always thought it was supposed to be one  rhyming with spokes . I can change that .
  - Japanese spelling and pronunciation would state otherwise though
  - Do nt think that really matters for abbreviations . It certainly does nt for acronyms .
- - Other than Patriots fans  I do nt think so .
  - Good  good . We need everyone behind us for this one .
- - I hear its way harder for out of state students
  - It is  but that is only some ten percent of the student body . And I rarely if ever hear that from out of state people .
- - Shit  Soon we ll have to call him Watson or Shane if he keeps on going good .
  - He s still a twat  and I ll still call him Twatto .
- - I ll record myself opening the vinyl the day it comes in .
  - No  we re talking stealing one of the CDs and leaking it digitally . You got ta do it  man . You re our only hope .
- - Those are some gigantic landing legs . Looks nice 
  - They are from Karbonite . The only reason I installed that mod for this mission .
- - She said she s never done it  she said she s never tried ...
  - sittin there tellin a mf lie  - Luda
- - Ankle deep in that mud too  that could have turned bad quickly .
  - Me too  I expected the gator to lunge  and him to fall and get bitten when he tried to evade .
- - I ll start rapping a freestyle about anything . I ll even do the whole arm thing rappers do and maybe start dancing .
  - Do you wear a cap and chain at the same time 
  - No . But it would be kinda neat to carry those things around . So if anybody wants to have a throw down I ll be ready .
  - Always be prepared to become a gangster .
- - That you do nt care does nt means other people do nt care .
  - I agree . I just had no idea it was a thing lol
- - Comparing game lobbies to car crashes is a bit silly really  also downright short-sighted and ignorant too .
  - Also  most cars do nt crash while most lobbies result in flame and abuse
- - OK . But who is Jeff Garza and what the hell is paycoin 
  - he s a long con artist  stay away
- - Do you get anything for being a referral 
  - No  only if you did nt the refering
- - Woah  I almost forgot about these guys  thanks for posting this . I used to listen a lot to their Electric Fungus album .
  - You re welcome . It s a shame they re not active anymore .
- - Is it worth seeing when you know who Keyser Soze is  It was spoiled for me .
  - It s still a great movie . It wo nt have as profound an effect  but on repeat viewings I still love it .
- - He was a cocky little bitch before that too ... But  he backs it up .
  - It s not about whether or not he can back it up but if he should even be cocky about an ILLEGAL Hit
- - is GEM the only graphical mod there 
  - That AI army composition is rather impressive too .
- - Is it really considered a bad thing to not want a date with someone who has had a lot of partners 
  - The entire list exists to mix ideological things in with niceguy things to hope people consider them equivalent .
- - Now that is a unpopular opinion about your favorite NBA team . Could nt see them parting ways with him  he s a Spur for life .
  - Yeah it ll never happen . Spurs like to reward loyal players and he has done too much for the organization for them to let him go
- - I do nt even recognize the language . Is that a fabric bag  If so  it s probably for some sort of grain .
  - It is a fabric bag . Could be Tibetan language 
- - I liked it but it could be a lot better with a story .
  - Really  Now I m curious . How would have you continued the story 
- - No Conley . No Monta . People are stupid .
  - Did you actually think Monta would get in though 
- - He got knocked down so hard he had to contemplate life for a second .
  - Yeah  you can see when his infancy ends .
- - Depending on which state you re in  you may have to . Many have it a law to turn lights on when precipitation is falling or wipers are on .
  - If you re only doing something to follow the law you do nt need to be doing it
- - Oh  great . GDQ is run by another SJW nutjob  Lovely . Makes me want to watch it even less .
  - Honestly I think there should be a separate event organized by normal people with no stupid SJW bullshit .
- - His ability actually accounted for why he was so weak that level
  - Yeah  that was cool . A lot of people say that Boyd was nt holding back on Ike  but he too has the Discipline skill in the Prologue .
- - That Americas first slave owner was a black man .
  - As were the slave owners back in Africa .
- - OH GEE THIS LOOKS LIKE FUN I WISH SOMEONE SAID WHAT THE FUCK IT S CALLED .
  - Happy Wheels . Was one of the famous YouTube fodder games .
- - Lets face it  his card sucks . Might go up for a bit because of people trying to squeeze every coin out of it but after that its discard
  - It s already at pretty much discard price .
- - That s seriously twisted  killing the parents and adopting the children
  - Well  at least they did nt kill the children as well . There s still a chance for them .
- - Nope . It happens with the Igo-W sometimes .
  - So can I turn it or is it a defective item 
- - Yeah  see  that s definitely harassment . That and the post in this very thread which got deleted  those are both harassment in my book .
  - I m so happy we finally reached a consensus .
- - I d be happy if Paige was a tweener .
  - Odds of Paige vs. Natalya vs. Nikki for the Divas title actually seem fairly high at this point . Tweener  face  heel . Works for me .

  - I just googled that because I was wondering too . If you look at the far side of the atoll there is a small forested island .
- - Firstly I d recommend finding another framing shop . If they wo nt even try to cater to us football fans I do nt see why you should give them money .
  - Please follow this advice . These type of people give us Yanks a bad name in the football world .
- - ahhh i was under the impression they were sweet alcoholic drinks .
  - How many years did you spend pissing on toilet seats before somebody told you to put it up 
- - I do nt know exactly  but you made me want to try it again  Thanks 
  - Play for at least an hour . Get used to the gem and trade system . It s pretty awesome .
- - I went through the Cinder booty post and linked people that had asked  more or less .
  - Something something something  provide the booty  kind sir .
- - What  You always give such good advice  bro 
  - Lots of people know the right thing to do . A large problem is that some of those people just ca nt execute . It really sucks .
- - so sad . my heart goes out to you and your family .
  - Thank you . It s definitely been a bumpy road since then .
- - I really hope you eventually fill that things up with more hardware . It looks a little barren in there .
  - Is nt that the point of using a segregated case 
- - I am not the one claiming that people who have no relation to government somehow limit free speech by reacting to cartoons they find offensive
  - We have very different interpretations of this cartoon . Pretty sure the artist was just pointing out a perceived hypocrisy .
- - I m about to get stationed in Korea later this year . How is Seoul for concerts 
  - dope  check out this spot called cakeshop
- - Honedge only has one ability  No Guard . It will gain Stance Change when it evolves to Aegislash .
  - Oh  well now I know . Thanks for letting me know .
- - They really should have started this game some time around now . The sun was ridiculous before  and now it s actually watchable .
  - But then they would nt have been able to talk about the eyeblack 
- - Every . Single . Time . Been doing that since his UCONN days .
  - Being as short as he is  I can see why that is his go to move .
- - Is there an award for the classiest football player of the year  Cause Mariota can win that too .
  - No joke . It s impossible to cheer against that guy .

  - Same here . Bothers me  but there s nothing to do about it .
- - Yeah thanks for your concern about our city you racist cunt .
  - Exactly  I do nt see how someone sitting in Australia can talk about Brum like this . Guessing they ca nt even locate us on a map .

  - I do plan to post more of my body . But  not too explicit . Thank you 
- - I ve never seen one before no one has .
  - I believe we ve reached the middle of this conversation .
- - is that seriously all you can come up with on that  after that debacle of a call by the refs  that is seriously youre response 
  - is that not a clear facemask  seriously

  - Great suggestion  thanks  Any chance of some linkage  My Google-fu is failing me .
- - The birth dates seem a bit questionable ... are nt Dennis and Sweet Dee supposed to be twins 
  - I think these are the birthdays of the actors  not the characters .
- - Let s be clear . AquaClear . NOT AquaTech .
  - I m sorry  It s fixed .
  - No problem . I did nt want you to get AquaTech . It s a brand sold at Walmart and made by Tetra . Definitely not on par with AquaClear .
  - Thank you SO much for correcting me then . I would ve gone for what I presume is the off brand at that rate 
- - That s awesome . Out of curiosity  do you remember who it was 
  - Not sure . He deleted not long after that .
- - I know  but when the US version is leagues ahead of others it is really annoying .
  - Hopefully another company will start up in those countries so they have decent competition . In the US there is at least Amazon Instant and probably others I am forgetting .
- - Piers Morgan . Do I need a reason 
  - Stephen Fry hates him  and that s enough for me .

  - if your trying to say thats not what tits feel like then your a beta and a liar because i have touched tits before and thats what they feel like .
- - I am just about holding my breath for the tubes to come back  lol .
  - I want the tubes  I m such a klutz with jars 
- - Thank you for advice  I think this is the best option at this point . I truly believe we both want to move forward . Its just getting there 
  - That s always the hardest part . Good luck op
- - Again  something can only be a terrorist action if directed against civilians with purpose of instilling fear to accomplish goals .
  - This is a civilian train  educate yourself .
- - It s amazing how technology has changed so much since then  but people and fashion has nt .
  - Jeans and a T-shirt has been fashionable since the dawn on man  so this picture is not a great example .
- - In Home Alone  Kevin s ticket was ruined by the milk spill during the pizza scene . Thus no one noticed an extra ticket and no Kevin .
  - I just noticed this when I watched Home Alone this Christmas season 
- - Would period blood have the same DNA from the woman in leaked out from 
  - Yes  period blood is still that woman s blood  it s just old .
- - If she had an active  safe sex life before this relationship and has been faithful thus far  why is that negative 
  - Red piller . Do nt try and logic w him . Just back away slowly and make soothing sounds .
- - What do you have problems with  exactly  I m sure we can point you in the right direction .
  - Ship design  what most of the buttons do  efficient use of fuel ... Everything pretty much .
- - What does any of that have to do with being a feminist  Feminists are allowed to be interested in clothes .
  - Which is why marketing to them is a good idea . Subversion of gender roles is the feminist element here  not disdain for haute couture .
- - Yeahhhh like wtf is the point of that   Lol you re already watching porn 
  - Like I do nt even like Asian girls but she is so beautiful to me . I just ca nt focus on anything but the blurring .
- - TL ; DR please  ai nt nobody got time for that .

- - Yea they said they were out last time I contacted them . It was right before the holidays and I missed it .
  - There are third party options of course that may be up your alley . Some brothers already posted a few .
- - i did nt know . i was just guessing  based on how it s spelled . makes sense
  - I was making a Ozzie Osborne joke  with the bat and the crazy .
- - If he thinks he was right while being wrong and still did good .
  - I do nt call that good ; I call that misguided .
- - Okay . The A that I saw in the clouds the other day seems a little scarier now after the A fireworks . haha
  - OMG I was thinking the same thing when it happened 
- - That s true  but is nt Batman s standard Loadout ridiculously OP 
  - Chi chi made it pretty late in a world martial arts tournament  never explicitly shown but that means she s probably borderline FTE  as well as an expert combatant .
- - Huh . Lots of things going wrong here . Which link is giving you a mature content warning 
  - Sorry  poorly edited comment  will fix 
- - Yeah . He definitely was selling that call .
  - yeah a lot of people in the game thread were talking about it and I was able to find that gif so threw it in there .
- - So everyone on this thread should vu everyone on this thread  right 
  - Yes . Even though I was in early on this thread  I still come back to VU everyone else .
- - I only eat potatoes on Sundays . A common myth about Ireland is that all of us endlessly scoff down potatoes .
  - That myth was only started because you re all too drunk to start your own myths
- - Cougs put up a harder fight than this ...
  - Yeah ... FSU really Coug d this one .
- - Do you have any tips for Goblins  I feel like I can only beat them if I dig and wait  skip the beat or have a long weapon .
  - Yeah they are tricky buggers  I usually get them to follow me then do as you said  dig or use a war drum to bring them closer .
- - Unfortunately it takes more than a few people like me to make the world a better place .
  - True  but you ve got to start somewhere .
- - Yes I am extremely bored at work .
  - me too ... I know this when I find myself looking at pictures of dinosaur origami . Who else is bored at work 
- - no  first  it s not a mechanical keyboard  and second  it s for the blackwidow and orbweaver line only .
  - Well time to go to goodwill  buy a mechanical keyboard and mod it out XD 
- - That has to be our longest TD pass all year
  - Ha . And it s a screen pass .
- - Who was that dipshit that was screaming as Vijay when he got out 
  - It s a soft hearted kid trying to impress his friends by looking tough
- - Nice  Live pro from Calgary  Nice work man .
  - Oh sweet thanks man  where do you play usually 
- - if you re depressed  see a therapist .
  - I wonder how therapists handle religion issues and whether they are religious themselves .
- - Standing up would mean deporting back to their countries all the muslim scum that is currently invading France . Sorry  no half measures .
  - no half measures ... sounds like something that an extremist would say . in all seriousness  treating extremism with more extremism is probably not a good idea .
- - It would be like Marvel fans hoping that Ultron kills everybody in the new Avengers movie .
  - Im not hoping to see characters killed off  but the director has a history of killing people off so I expect it to happen .
- - Cool jacket  Jeans leave me wanting .
  - Yeah I think some stonewashed ones would work pretty well but I d need to get some first .
- - Just as abusable . Get a clan together and mass commend eachother . You d never be able to get LP again .
  - True ... There must be a way to work around this  Tired as all hell atm  someone else fix this ; P

  - He can clearly still cut it over here  why would he want to move
- - Creatine did quite well for me in terms of energy in the gym when doing keto .
  - Agreed  I found creatine very helpful with a low carb diet
- - Have been watching Falling Skies . Probably that .
  - Yeah ... the risk is that they ll just exterminate us all rather than try to harvest us ...
- - No one gives a shit that your offended .
  - That his offended is what  What is his offended 
- - Fair point there . And im glad you hurt them but you should be original and create your own . But good luck anyways
  - Yeah dude . They ve made a lot of money through that . Thanks . D Have a good day . Happy New Year
- - Raise the tax high enough and everybody goes back to Marlboro Country .
  - Or if they re smart they can just buy juices online
- - Let s get a gif of the kicker getting fucking REKT and some sonic rings flying out .
  - The rocking and falling over make it a perfect WASTED gif too .
- - Proof could have booked it for flag and prevented that cap man .
  - ya he has no idea what he s doing sometimes . then again that s just our perspective as a viewer .
- - Weird I was there last weekend and it was a pain to find a bathroom
  - I always just walked into a bar and had no trouble  maybe wait a minute or two but not bad considering how many people are out on the street .
- - Yes definitely  Were you dead set on moving 
  - I d prefer to move into a house  but sent you a pm just in case I do nt find one .
- - I did nt have a chance to check myself  but does anyone else with TWC in LA have the new channel 
  - If you go to their website they have a channel finder . Just need to put in your zip code and tv provider .
- - But we are on a largely liberal social website . What better way to get some up votes than to tie a Republican to supporting the beheading of gays 
  - Yeah  we should nt lose our heads over this
- - The best weapon against crazy is apathy .
  - sounds like you ve met a girl or two . preach .
- - Lol I think you misunderstood my question . Thanks anyway
  - Ah sorry about that  hopefully someone else can give you an appropriate answer .
- - This fucker would end up with the worst diarrhea from Ex-Lax pills crushed into peanut butter cookies if he was staying with me .

- - Could nt of said it better myself .
  - You sure do of a way with words .
- - I sleep a lot . Are you backpacking or just setting up in one spot for three days 
  - One spot . I ve got friends joining me tomorrow and leaving the next day .
- - You should head that up . Start a thread  maybe set a meet up time in the IRC .
  - Whoa now ... I did nt say anything about talking to you people live 
- - well its still selling so add a few more million to that for the release and then dvd s tv rights etc . Im sure it ll make it a profit .
  - It s nice that you re so sure . Say  are you one of those people who still thinks this was some kind of publicity stunt 
- - Is it just me  or are the new ones looking like chars from Tsuritama 
  - it s by that same guy who designed tsuritama
- - how does this happen   good god
  - More importantly  how do I get one myself 
- - Makes sense . I ca nt imagine that non-smash amiibos would keep the gold coin style base .
  - I was thinking about that after I looked at my Amiibo too  I think its cool that they have the ability to have game specific poses and characters 
- - Are you not in the mix to jump to the buy side 
  - Would love to . But I am only a handful of months in . I need to stick it out longer .
- - I can tell you re out of kind words .
  - I really am . I mean  I do have kind words  but I ve used em up . You re smart and funny  what else can I say

  - It s totally doable but I wo nt take the time to do it myself  sorry 
- - Then why did you get the fucking percent chance wrong 
  - I m sorry to ruin your entire day .
- - yeah but they did fix the issue where people were not getting stars . plus one guy does get out of the truck  so you have to be quick .
  - I d go for it  just do nt drive your personal vehicle and if you die they allways respawn
- - you were criticizing my grammar and such  you do nt even follow it yourself . You are nothing man . Sorry that you are like this .
  - Even with me saying that  I still have better grammar than you . Real 
- - Maybe a lawyer could get them to reduce the cost of her stay because of the way those idiots treated a sick woman .
  - This is Canada so it is covered .
- - I m to poor to buy food to .
  - Look up local food banks and make an appointment .
- - Nope  sorry . You can not change the size of the Wii U menu .
  - Darn it ... my ocd doesnt agree with that .
- - Wow if those are really the pastebin terms they re almost never enforced .
  - Yeah  I m not holding my breath or anything but they do have a report button so I figured I d use it .
- - Congrats on your success  So how are those soaps coming 
  - I m struggling to get it right  but I ll just keep going until I get it perfect .
  - Cool . Are you making it yourself 
  - I m wo nt be making any soap personally  but I am working to formulate the fragrance oil so it will be more fragrant in soap .
- - Seems like that bowler falls over after every delivery ...
  - The hurricanes put ice on the pitch .

  - The article is from today  I linked back as far as I could go .
- - He died  man . It sucks  but that s the game .
  - That s what I thought  but I guess it gives me opportunities to use other Pokes 
- - Do you feel like it free back thicker 
  - Each hair is a bit thicker and darker  but that s just because the ends are stumpy I think 
- - Yeah  they look nice  but they look like everyone else s jersey . Makes it harder to pick out who s who from aerial shots of races .
  - Why ca nt I find the new kit anywhere 
- - well even the smallest bulge is a bad sign
  - Honestly I couldnt tell and never had problems with capacitors .
- - Why is the left side the correct side  Ive never heard of that before .
  - Relieves pressure off of the Vena Cava which is the artery running to the heart .
- - It is super treatable . So if you do have it  be lucky it is nt something worse . It still could be a fissure or rip .
  - Treatable but deadly if you ignore it .
- - Was nt calling anyone a shitlord who preffered different . Also  having leg hair does nt make one unhygenic . If thats true  what about men 
  - Just out of curiosity  hypothetically if you had to choose between the relationship ending  or shaving your legs semi-regularly  which would you choose 
- - I think i ve heard that music in many a video .
  - But for real  I like that song  anyone know what it is 
- - When will it arrive  I m thinking about starting that one again as well . We could start at the same time  just for the fun of it ...
  - It s scheduled to arrive Saturday at the earliest  I believe . I do nt know how different it is from the original  but it should be close enough .
- - I think that is against the law . Microsoft got sued for selling Xbox live points in screwy increments .
  - Seems doubtful  is there a source on that 
- - WE care  we want you to be happy .
