  - Said like it s hard to fake that stuff .
- - This was apparently filmed in digital  If so  amazing . Film s not everything .
  - This is proof that film is not necessary .
- - Well I would see it as a great hire . And the though of being able to see the Ryan brothers go at it twice a year is exciting .
  - Why is no one discussing the fact that Rex might not take the job because of his brother or Rob might leave due to Rex .
- - This pretty much sums up modding in Skyrim .
  - Need more anime references and women with dicks .
