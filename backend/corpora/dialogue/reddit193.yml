- - Personally MDMA comedowns are mostly just feeling fucking weird .
  - All I ve had all day is elation and energy .

  - I do nt know  but the statement I commented on was nt qualified in any way and was absolute . I was picking a nit is all .

  - Yeah I would have called it after he hid under the bed . It was funny until then  and they could nt catch it up until that point .
- - Bacon and cream cheese stuffed mushrooms sound amazing . Would you happen to have a recipe 
  - Cook bacon  chop it up  mix into cream cheese  stuff into mushrooms  bake .
- - But yet the books meaning comes from the ending  it teaches us to avoid anything like that from happening in real life .

- - Funny about your username . Does he still own a Miata racing team 
  - Yep  I thought about seeing them race here in Wisconsin  but it was too much money
- - Is it bad for me to hope they ll say something stupid 
  - I d say it s more just anticipating the inevitable .
- - Those are nt about massively overpricing nigh worthless rocks which are mined by slaves .
  - They do  however  also involve rampant consumerism and waste .

- - You re not wrong  but I m sure you know what I meant .
  - I know . I m just being kind of a dick .
- - Oh god  look at the Pats one . They say Manning almost as much as they say Gronk . But no  they re not obsessed ...
  - Is that all you talk about in this thread  The Patriots 
- - Since police are deliberately turning a blind eye  looks like it s up to those damn private lawyers everyone hates so much until you need one .

- - It d be nice if there was some sort of description .
  - The article is linked at the bottom of the album .

  - He said on twitter that El-P should produce for his next album . I really do hope so .

  - Apparently smart kids are all born to rich parents in wealthy countries . Who knew

  - Not really  you re asserting you know better than OP about the law  with no basis for it .
- - You ll be amazed how often you can comment on your own work - or a topic you know about - and be ignored .
