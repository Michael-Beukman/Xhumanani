  - Why not  It s so simple to do  I believe it .
- - Thanks - what were some of the other options you looked into outside of mutual funds  Any reason you decided to go with Vanguard over other mutual funds 
  - Other options boiled down to savings accounts and CDs  like others have suggested . I chose Vanguard because of their funds having one of the lowest expense ratios .
- - Burger power  Will u get another nissan 
  - Most likely . They obviously can take a beating .
- - I fully agree . Maybe I was nt clear in my last paragraph but that s what I was trying to imply

  - Nah it s closer to Fallout but even closer to Rage .
- - They are more pro SEC than SEC fans ... that in itself is awful .
  - As an SEC fan you are right . That is awful . And difficult to accomplish ...
- - gon na have different options based off of the different dex s

  - I wish I had been born at the time when Cha Bum was playing . My dad speaks so highly of him .
- - Faction missions no longer show a countdown timer when sending friends on a mission . They show the current time instead .
  - Most likely a bug  not a feature .

  - The answer is no . But they probably have a stock purchasing program .
- - Casablanca . Their sandwiches are nt just good relative to the rest of Korea ... they compete with the best in the world 
  - I was at Casablanca an hour ago  for the first time . The Moroccan Chicken was fin bomb .
  - Every time I go to Casablanca  I really plan to try the lamb chili . I end up getting the chicken every single time .
  - Who s down voting Casablanca and what is their problem . It s probably the Baker s Table people .
- - If you can afford that much mouthwash you can afford real alcohol . Going with troll or moron .

  - well at least my clever napkin covering and camera angling forced another step

- - Oh man I ll have to try this . I m a huge fan of lemon pepper wings so this would probably be perfect
  - Oh it should be in a deep pyrex or glass pan clearly to hold the soup and lemon juice in .
- - As a poly juggler  this was awesome  Thank you 
  - What  Another poly juggler      I m coming to find we are fairly common actually . Awesome .

  - The logs did nt come from hacking . The proof they were real  That did .
- - Nah  Portugal is best . They were first .
  - Are you sure  I mean  Brazil is the best they could come up with .
- - I get that yeah  its quitting for yourself . I was just saying for me personally I do nt think I could go teetotal for life .

  - ah I have the first touch  so that is probably why . P

- - what if league is the only they you do 
  - then you should have a second PC with a custom game running so while you are loading you can practice last hitting there
- - Let me know if it comes out shiny 
  - Thank you . It was a shiny 
- - Nice work  Anticipating a move to the NBA arc  Just wanted to be prepared for it 
  - My guess is that it s an old basketball court coffee table that was repurposed with ISU logos .

  - Look at you  pretending like you actually care if I join you or not .
- - In lieu of carrier pigeons  I m announcing it here . there will be playoff threads for the games this weekend . maybe . probably .

  - That s to scare the mice . Elephants are scared of mice . Mice are scared of the colour red . Clever buggers . The animal kingdom is fascinating .
  - No  its so they can hide in apple trees
- - It just stuff from the pilot . Remember that the first episodes are always full of this stuff since they do nt even know if they ll even have a show .
  - True  but I could see them making this discrepancy into a plot point somehow .

  - Oh Oh Oh  you know what I m talkin bout

  - worst part is they dont have any loot ... I never enter those  pure waste of time
- - Those ritzy fuckers on the far right with the satellite dish ...
  - I m pretty sure that s a garbage can lid ...
- - Why is it cheaper to manufacture in China  Can you think of any reasons 
  - Sarcasm  Primarily it s a lack of labor regulation and environmental regulation which means our products are manufactured in China by slaves in factories spewing black smoke .
- - That s a fairly underrated game you are playing right there sir . I would like to say good choice it s my favorite of the spinoffs .
  - Hmm ... maybe not underrated so much as underplayed .
- - What Im asking if you have played anything since attempting to play that one disk .
  - Ah . Yes I ve tried other DVDs and Blu-rays since then and they were fine .
- - This is impressive stuff . Tons of interesting stats in here . The Wyatts lost a lot on house shows it seems .

- - So a few million a year wo nt motivate him 
  - Nah  he s been on good money his whole career . He only performs when his contract is up for renewal
- - Looks like someone lost their life on that bridge .
  - There are quite a few accidents on this highway . It s called the Sea To Sky Highway .
- - Well if he is nt selling the script then you need to be paid by him . The writers guild of your realm should be able to assist you .
  - He lives in scotland and I live in Ukraine and we do nt really have anything remotely close to a writer s guild here .
  - Does he have a publisher  Agent  Manager  Do you have any of those things

- - My vote is a dual ingrown hair .
  - We think it s a triple or quadruple ingrown hair that fused together to produce that monster of a bump .
- - Even if he was  we would nt owe him still .
  - He said own . As in  black people are slaves .
- - Every time I watch a good montage it makes me want to load up tribes .

- - Boomkin is easy to play  hard to master . Just cause you play a boomkin doesnt mean youre just going to plaster the meters .

  - It was a TV screen  not a gloryhole dude .
  - Jenny McCarthy s mouth and a glory hole have a lot in common .
- - He s right about one thing . That is a skittle weird .
  - I got excited that skittles were part of the story  then let down .
- - Haha  no I m not c . I guess I just do nt like internet people knowing what I look like
  - that s fine . do you like to know what internet poeple look like
