  - Making those assholes who keep talking about trading him eat their words .
- - And you ve been a basketball fan ever since 
  - Yes  my acting career thwarted  my romantic experiences much delayed .
- - Is there ever a time when I would take something over heal as an ADC  Like barrier or ignite

  - And in WotLK . The Tournament reset  and still does  ever change .
- - Today s is nt helped at all by the huge gusts of wind blowing everyone around .
  - That s true . I just drive a little jetta and am having to really hang on to the wheel .
- - I seriously think that  at this point  TB should look at another media to use instead of Twitter . I know I would .
  - Why should he  These haters are in the minority and it s the opinion of the majority that supports him which should matter .

  - With haki . If you re talking about Nami or Usopp  Oda confirmed that is a gag . One Piece comedy toonforce .
- - You ve been trolling here how long and have nt heard rationale for not thinking drug and money laundering laws are just  I do nt buy that .
  - I guess the fact that nobody here can provide such a rationale suggests that it probably does nt exist .
- - But seriously  how do you tag someone

- - Then she wonders why you re putting up pictures of the man she went with about nine months before your birth ...
  - So I m like the Jesus of PC gaming 
- - I m afraid I do nt see the connection . I m talking about married clergy inappropriately touching people  not being homophobes .
  - Did you read the article  It s about Russian Orthodox Church and it s secret gay sex ring .
- - I d like to see him turn down the Nobel prize .
  - The Nobel committee is nt a government  so his reason for rejecting the Legion dhonneur would nt be relevant in that case .

- - You obviously missed the point . But thanks for your blind obedience 
  - The point was that you do nt know what you re going on about . And no  thank you for your blind and willful ignorance .
- - How can PC gamers be so ignorant  you can literally use any set of controllers you want  how ever you want for any game .
  - Maybe it was nt ignorance of the peripheral just ignorance of how awesome it is to use one 
- - I wonder how difficult it would be to produce an arrow that contains a GPS tracker .
  - Not very efficient . A good shot with an arrow will go clean through .

  - Looking forward to hearing you making more claims about what you do nt like . DISEASE OF THE MIND  ROSHI  DISEASE OF THE MIND 
- - And the final two are Puma and Mundo  the same two who main evened the first ever show . Why ca nt Raw have this sort of continuity 
  - Some would say they have great continuity - Insert Cena  Insert Authority . It s just shitty continuity .
- - I would recommend against box dye  though . It s much more harsh on your hair than paying to get it done by a professional .
  - I agree . I ve recently found a shop that sells professional salon dyes and ca nt wait to try some .
- - And it s done ... Now Barca needs to win for this to mean something  otherwise it wo nt ...
  - It would still mean something for the other teams  but yeah  we have to cash in on this .

- - In addition  headlights are pointless due to their excellent night vision .
  - Well  they are nt pointless quite yet  as humans still need them on other cars to know not to pull out in front of them .
- - Plus Vidic is garbage . I m afraid Poldi wo nt help much in the off the ball movement department .
  - Yeah  that s probably one of Poldi s biggest weaknesses
