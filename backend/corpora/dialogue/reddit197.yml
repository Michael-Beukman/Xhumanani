  - Yes . I have one ... but I was hoping for specific suggestions .
- - This is a case of semantics . However  my take is supported with textual evidence . Your take is speculation and deduction based on said speculation .
  - You ca nt prove a negative . I could sit here all day and quote passages featuring Ghost not speaking .

  - Sharia law is against the German constitution . Advocacy for its implementation will get you arrested .

  - Except that the overwhelming majority of muslims does nt want Sharia law in Germany so tough luck .
- - I use the same amount as gold as you

  - Hey  I never said it was nt true . In fact it s pretty close to what I m actually like . I guess we re similar people .
- - It s definitely not one of those ; there are no side marker turn signal indicators on the fenders . Most definitely a Plymouth .
  - What about the Chrysler emblem on the grill 
- - Serial was not and is not journalism .
  - What an oddly narrow definition of journalism you have .
- - What the people are doing is just their nature as well .
  - It amazes me how overlooked this is .
  - Except part of what defines us is to have control over our nature .
  - I would argue we do not have control over our nature  just a greater ability to resist urges .
- - Pineapple Express dvd case  good choice .
  - Thank you  I tend to agree 
- - Germany prioritizes the well being of it s citizens  the US prioritizes it s business interests .

  - I was quoting the part where he said that he did nt know about the sales .
- - I know  but it s a walking  talking hamburger .
  - So was the cop  Big Mac .
- - Reminds me of Frank Castle to be honest . He s an anti-hero - but also a psychopath to whom killing is as easy as breathing .
  - Oh  absolutely . But his casual killing is nt what I call badass either .
- - Feeling like I have a place in the gaming community for the first time in my life .
  - Genuinely curious  can you elaborate  If you dont want to  that s cool 
- - Of this particular man but I d look at the rest of your shots too 
  - This is the only shot I have of him as I was running late for work and the street was insanely crowded and I was pushed around 
- - I WANT THIS TO HAPPEN SO BADLY JUST BECAUSE ALL THOSE STEELERS FANS LEFT HEINZ FIELD
  - Why leave a game early  especially a playoff game  I ll never understand .
- - It s pretty funny . When does he return  Cause I hope for his sake he is nt playing in our next meeting when LeBron is back ...
  - I think he s making his debut next season
- - Did you try turning the system off and back on again  you cis-gendered shitlord 
  - You re oppressing me with your IT skills .
- - I thought your pits chafe if you shave them .
  - ya  I can only do it once a week tops .
- - I can only imagine the classy kinda people who attend that .
  - basically everyone that gets bored at CES .
- - Is that a single tear drop I see on your paper 
  - Haha no it s rain  still sad though
- - Do you screen your weddings via film reel 
  - This is a totally invalid point . Most theatres in the world now project digitally  filmmaking does not directly imply shooting on film .
- - That is because YOU STOLE ALL OF IT FROM US  Damn swedish and german people . Always stealing our land .
  - You did get Greenland in the divorce which is pretty fair  now shut up and go eat some plse
- - You do nt even have a flair .
  - Obviously the mods went overboard with the fading .

  - I have a bag full of tricks .

  - I should ve put it at the top but wanted to include all the images for completeness
- - The Foo Fighters seemed to be well loved by all walks of life .

  - since he tried blue cheese he ai nt likin  ranch
- - Jokes on you . I do nt even live on your side of the planet .
  - I ll give you that the joke s on me . Yes  that s how it works here .
- - That ... none of what you just said is true
  - Are you saying that two sperm contain the exact same genetic code 
- - Have you tried on the gamertag that owns MCC
  - Tried what  I m always logged on
- - I hope not  they need a follow up to Lost in the Dream .
  - There s a few more follow ups they owe .
- - i agreed with this person so maybe you should put your tin foil hat away and sit down .
  - You made several comments implying that vapors who were not smokers are idiots . Turns out you are one of those idiots  and a hypocrite to boot .
- - Steve had a hell of a game too . He was the reason Falco tripped on lineman s feet a couple times .
  - Steve is a beast . The guy was cut so many times from the practice squad  only to work his way up as Casey Hampton s replacement .
- - Ugh  had to look it up  realized I d seen them before and hate them . I m totally on your side here .
  - I know man ... maybe it s an inside joke thing . Who knows .
- - Elderly Crossing . It s an arcade game about helping elderly people cross the street
  - Or preventing them from crossing the road ...
- - If only tailwind was replaced by some actual flight or hover ability ...
  - All I ask for is the ability to turn during tailwind .
- - Did that the first week I lived alone . Sprinted to turn off the dishwasher and slid on the suds and cracked my head on the floor .
  - we did nt notice until it was too far gone to matter
- - how retarded must u be . serves u right
  - Ask your mommy . She served me right .
- - There might be a CV headed your way this summer  depending on uni finances . Hope it all goes well 
  - I d love to be able to employ someone but we are nt there yet . Then again - the summer is a way away .
- - Tell me how Detective Conan could end  It has just taken too long and the plot is so out of place now .
  - I have already gave up on keeping up with it . There was pretty much no plot development .
- - Then you missed the deadline . You said it yourself - you fucked up . Learn from this .
  - I was hoping for a blunt  straightforward answer instead of a lecture  so I thank you for that .
- - Using chrome . Any dark skin I ve tried does not change white loading screens . Do you happen to know one that would 
  - Yes  all us night res users with dark chrome skins are waiting for this day 
- - Sad he feels he ca nt be with someone he could truly love .
  - Why do you think he is nt with someone he can truly love 
- - That s ok  just install Adobe Reader and update your edition of Google Ultron .
  - Wipe it all down with a magnet .
- - I do nt see Muslims sticking to what it says in the Koran NOT being a problem with Islam .
  - You could say that for every religion  there are extremists who take every word of their chosen book seriously and literally .
- - After captains are chosen  how will be pool of available players be seperated  By ELO or lane prefs or some mix of the two 
  - We re going with a single pool for now .
- - Maybe this time I ll actually be able to participate  . D
  - Make sure you do  Some of the established players have agreed to split up too  which should make it fun for smaller civs to get started .
- - And  The police still investigate tweets .
  - Death threats  Seems pretty reasonable to me .
  - It does nt to me . Plus who was Katie Hopkins threatening to kill 
  - Somebody reported her comments to the police . They are obliged to investigate every report they receive . Did they arrest her 
- - That s been there forever lol If you check its properties it has nt been touched since April
  - It s so old  that Hecarim is also waiting for it
- - Maybe it ll increase the value if I make a kick ass gun and kill myself with it lol
  - Only if you get some blood on it .
- - For the people who voted other  what state could he have been apart from alive or dead  a zombie 
  - I think he ll start to haunt slaine as a space ghost . That s when slaine loses it
- - A prime example of the hordes of bigoted idiots that will come out of the woodwork in the the coming days .
  - A prime example of intolerance for any kind of debate that do not fit your world view .
- - The distinction between sex and gender is a very recent phenomena  so no .
  - This is a good point . In that if sex and gender are considered the same thing  then it implies a biological definition of gender .
- - Ca nt find a Magikarp under your name . D .
  - it s really there . could you check again  and message is . f  nez  x
- - Does it have to be in person  Amazon sells many varieties online .
  - I saw it on amazon but it s in large quantities . Really hoping to find it locally
- - Yeah i mean  it s just a high school offense . It would never work against good teams .
  - You obviously ca nt beat an SEC team with it .
- - You are so blind I do nt know why I even bother .
  - Another example of what I said in the original post of his fanboys getting quirky  because they do nt even want to understand a simple thing
  - And I could just say that his haters done seem to understand anything either . You have got to learn that your opinion does nt equal fact .
  - My OP was a fact followed by an opinion which was an obvious conclusion from the fact
- - My new years resolution was to not let little things get me down ... I have already broken it .
  - Well  baby steps  How about starting off with not letting them get you down as much 
- - That would be like The Usos wrestling the Big Show
  - That s a very accurate analogy  did not expect that reference .
- - the thing about playing chicken is that both parties have to be opposed to colliding . trains do nt really get that part . ruins the fun tbh
  - Not if you enjoy the feel of warm  red mist on your face .
- - I am going to use slovenly trull and brazen strumpet in as many situations as I can . Looks like I have some new insults .
  - Personally  I m going to be a slovenly trull and a brazen strumpet in as many situations as I can .
- - Having different temperature settings must be great . I m waiting for my tea to cool while typing this .
  - Black tea really should be brewed near boiling temperatures for best taste . If you want to cool it you can always add a small piece of ice afterwards .
- - Did someone forget to tell the Cowboys O line the game started  Romo is running for his life .
  - Did you know Detroit has a really good D line 
- - That does make a lot of sense . So child actors that transition into adult actors such a DiCaprio or Neil Patrick Harris must be really fortunate
  - Leo is kinda goofy looking actually . It s kinda scary how he s morphing into Jack Nicholson
- - Always stand on the right side of the escalator if you plan on standing still . This way the people who walk all the way up can pass you .
  - Or the left if you are going down 
- - DUDE this is exactly what I needed to hear .
  - yah just keep in mind that they re pretty long too
- - I read that in The Tick s voice .
  - What  you mean his voice does nt already narrate everything you read and think  That s ... Unamerican 
- - People do nt realize the importance of Westbrook being on the floor and shooting . He creates a HUGE distraction so defenses cant focus just on KD .
  - And vice a versa ... Westbrook would not produce the same on his own
- - No  my eyes can make tear ... just not enough to do a true cry I do need drops
  - That really sucks . Has it been a lifelong condition or did it develop recently 
- - Maybe if it gets picked up by Hulu we would not have to wait two years for episodes to get on .
  - It s already on Hulu and you d still have to wait . Got ta sell those BBC America packages on cable and satellite somehow .
- - Love Tillman  but his body is toast .
  - I really hope he retires . And unlike a lot of guys people want to  I think Tillman would make a great coach .
- - You ca nt put the weapon on safe if it is fully cleared .
  - Pretty sure that s not true . It runs exactly like a standard Stoner lower . Mag in  on fire  looks like a hot weapon .
- - So he was still wearing his socks  then  Business socks for business time 
  - I m stealing this  not even gon na feel bad about it
- - I honestly do nt know how I feel about this .
  - I do nt know about you  but it made me giggle .

  - On her wedding day . This picture makes me sad .
- - I d tap that ... Tony Romo I mean
  - after his performance  shoot  what guy would nt want to .
- - I have a boxer  she does exactly this . She ll turn her butt sideways while running towards you in excitement . Most entertaining thing to watch haha
  - My boxers do this too  We call it the u  because their head and butt both move in the same direction hahah
  - That s funny  my family calls it the kidney bean 
  - They also prance around and wiggle when they see us or get a toy  we call it the happy dance  everyone knows the boxer wiggle haha
- - I have a fox for trade to if all of these fall through for you
  - Whoever posts their time stamped photo in here first and if it looks good is the winner
- - Do I have to download something extra to do stage striking  Pressing Y does nt seem to work .
  - Press X. Y strikes all the stages that are turned off .
- - I think Panic Circle helps too since when it s panicked  it wo nt be able to dodge as easily .
  - It resists both panic and binds so it is also a valid strategy probably best to give it to Naoto considering you should have Impure Reach on her already .
- - Craft The World has a Dungeon Keeper feel in a Terraria world .
  - Looks cool  I m sold - and it s a small download  Cheers . D
- - You ve never seen anything until you ve driven on the roads in Ohio .
  - East Cleveland is the worst place to drive ever

  - They are an expensive used clothing store  right 
- - I ve not been able to use them  even though I followed every single direction
  - What version of the game are you running 
- - Steam Achievement Manager ... basically just gives you achievements instantly .
  - Is that allowed  Or u can get banned for using that 
- - China no longer need a meatshield against SK . SK and China has developed a very close tie over the years .
  - Yes but SK bordering China means US bases potentially close to China . Why would China want that 
- - Are you men of wealth and taste 
  - Damnit  you beat me to the punch
- - Do nt recall Ross being a werewolf  and is nt Smith a frog type thing  not a slime 
  - Sips just refers to Smith as Kermit because of his avatar s green skin .
- - No friends to stay with . I doubt my mother would let me leave anyway .
  - Op where do you live  Pm me
- - So those are all empty cases  I wonder what you could do with all of those .
  - They are full xboxes . They just need a power cable and controller . They all worked .
- - Do you keep a blog or journal or anything  Would be interesting to read . So envious  A year each   that s awesome man .
  - No . It s all on video though if you have nt seen the rest of my channel . I like making vids for everything I do and see
- - Lol Newton just mentioned going to Seattle as well . Do they not know that they might end up in GB 
  - No one is giving Detroit any chance  but if they win et would be the return of Golden Tate to Seattle  but on the wrong side of the ball .
- - But why are they slaughtering the Samurai surfers  Japan and Nazis were allies 
  - Yes  the rest of the movie made perfect sense  but this specific detail is ridiculous 
- - I have to wonder if that runner is all gas tank or just for show .
  - It s probably real . You know that gas mileage has to be horrible .
- - I typed in the guns name and looked at all of its perks . None of them have a boost to finding more exotics . It was the first link .
  - Not much info though . Just name things without explanation of all capabilities .
- - Sweet Georgia Brown s  Good God now I m hungry .
  - For portion size only  It s a bit plain otherwise .
- - yea im starting to not like it as much . i might trade it with my friend that wants it
  - once bought you ca nt give it away
- - That was actually extremely sound advice they did nt follow .
  - Lebron got his back pain trying to carry that team in the finals
- - how about do nt be there in the first place 
  - I went to bars and clubs when I was his age . You did nt 
  - None of those examples are you being an NFL quarterback  so I do nt care if you went out and partied .
  - Oh . My . God . You re an idiot .
- - I think you can look at the other comments to tell
  - No your comment does nt make sense . How does RNG make up for lack of content 
- - What was your actual thought process when drafting this title  Edit . speaking of originality ... is nt this already on the front page 
  - I did nt make the title . That is the title from the actual video . And show me where this video is already on the front page 
- - Life s tough  is nt it 
  - I do nt even know how I deal from day to day  but I make it work .
- - I realized that after the bot responded  that s for the heads up though 
  - And thanks to you for the black card idea  adding to my deck for sure .
- - Ooh now put it in a SCAR .
  - If you have a SCAR L you could just use the Angel Custom banana STANAG mags .
  - I know I can but i do nt own any of those mags . So I was hoping one of you would .
  - Nah . Everyone knows ARs can not into GLORIOUS .
- - Behold  The only practical effects used in this trilogy 
  - That s a little harsh  and since I assumed that Laketown was Practical until you said that I m not sure if it matters .
- - I think it s high time for publicly funded  protected bike storage .
  - With all the lack of funds for other programs I think I ll pass on my tax dollars going to secure someone s bike .
  - Then perhaps we should sell the publicly owned parking garages . Why should the public spend money to secure someone s car 
  - The parking garage I use has a fenced area specifically for bicycles and it s always packed . What s wrong with those 
- - ED Hungry . Love those Chex Mix Muddy Buddies Peanut butter and chocolate .
  - Mmm  those sound good . You had me at Chex Mix
- - This was one of my favorite pictures of him .

- - Maybe so  but if you re only drinking to get drunk  you re doing it wrong .
  - I completely agree . However OP seems to be doing it wrong  so they d want to do it cheap too
- - Pittsburgh is supposed to have a defense . This is going to be boring .
  - They are  I have nt seen it for three years .
- - Just like he was full of shit when JR flat out denied when MetsFan confirmed that he was going to call NJPW  hmm ...
  - Dirt sheets said the same thing  plus that has nothing to do with the WWE .
- - You could make a graph of their error rate  I suppose .
  - Simple and useful . I ll work on getting this in
- - do they make a sauerkraut donut or something 
  - That would go well with the bacon doughnut .
- - i actually did nt say pretty . i meant pizza lmao . it autocorrected it to pretty .
  - i love Nate s development . Jay s also .
