  - If that s an option to you  sure . Just note that even if the state sells  availability has been reported limited .

- - It s for sure not lack of talent . This team has plenty of that .
  - We have some  but i would nt say a lot . Not compared to a cup contender at least .
- - Single coverage on Kobe during crucial possession of the game . Kobe s recent willingness to pass has opened the game up for him .
  - He s probably the best playmaker on the Lakers  and I mean that as a sincere compliment . His creativity and vision are elite .
  - Well he is one of the all time greats .
  - Of course . I m just surprised he never really tried to function as a Point Guard .

- - I would really like to meet TheOddOne . He seems like a pretty chill guy and is pretty funny on stream .
  - Theoddone is the only reason that I started to like tsm when I first started playing league . I ll join the generals army any day .
- - Additionally  what if we had a filter to only be grouped with players with voice enabled 
  - Could also be an idea  but seems a bit odd in my opinion .

  - Could be paranoia  I m eating healthy and have nt given in . Thanks for the suggestion 
- - It was still second down  just a half the distance to the goal penalty .

- - I hated that episode . They ruined Kif and Amy for a pretty stupid episode  and they could have used any human in that role anyway .
  - Amy is just a huge skank though .
- - I think people here overestimate how good the drawing actually is . She s traced the original image which is nt very hard to do
  - based on that jaw  she still fucked it up .

  - Just keep shouting at the walls buddy .
- - Believe it or not the Blockbuster in my town is still up and running
  - Mine too . But I m in Australia where people are still finding use in BB . Though Netflix adoption is becoming more and more common .
- - So what happened to Gold and Stardust feuding with The New Day  Seems like the way to hotshot yourselves into a program is to attack the New Day for no reason
  - It s hard to call it a feud when they just kept losing to the New Day every match
- - Did you register your gun  I gave Ruger my address and name in exchange for product information and coupons . I only assume they sold my name to the NRA .

- - You should really consider making and selling those banners . I d buy one .
  - I ll have to look at fabric prices and see how economically feasible it would be  If it comes out to a reasonable amount  I ll definitely let yall know
- - Amazing . I like how the old guy stands as if he is going to do something .
  - I bet the old man is more likely to actually do something than anyone standing behind him .
- - Yes  and marrying someone your age is like marrying your brother or sister .
  - Or if you re gay  marrying your clone . Well  now that I think about it  I d probably be all right with that .
- - Could nt they do like the Russians in the Crimea and just organize a vote to separate from Syria and then join Israel 
  - Just like in Crimea  it would still be a violation of international law
- - Thats an interesting fact  I always assumed the English made up the word . TIL i guess .
  - Yeah  it is a actually a very interesting fact . I was surprised actually a lot when I first heard of it .

  - Marth  Villager  Wii Fit Trainer .
- - Yeah she was pretty obnoxious . The cop should have felt disrespected . Seriously
  - And seeing as she was cuffed later means she listened very poorly to what the officer SPECIFICALLY told her not to do
  - Others were arrested as well . I do nt think she actually blew bubbles on him .
  - The way the video is edited is intended to fit their narrative . No way to know what she did to earn her arrest .
- - The announcer said Terry made that shot  but I thought it was brewer 
  - They are nt on top of our Headband game .
- - How do I load milk software  Does it go into the computers sloppy drive

  - Looks more like a paint than a shop .
- - Looks like the Kings got a bit of their own medicine .
  - How so  I do nt remember the Kings being on the other side of this often .
- - Except you can choose your religion but your color of skin is determined by birth .
  - That s missing the point entirely  which is that this sort of generalization is equally wrong in both cases .
- - He did say he was nt dating this other chick - it was a study session ...
  - No . He EXPLICITLY said he went on a date . He edited his post .
- - As someone with a barrage of mental illnesses including schizophrenia I d assume that born deaf schizophrenics would have visual hallucinations instead of audible hallucinations .
  - But isnt hallucinations a different thing than schizophrenia  so would nt it be called something different

- - do you know how tickets worked  was it just a normal concert  or did you have to know people 
  - I think you had to know people close to ye .
