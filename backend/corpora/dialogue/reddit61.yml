  - I think that s more your confirmation bias than anything I said .
- - The human race  The fact that there is just one human race does nt mean that there is no racism . If only that were true ... . P
  - Why use the word racism at all then  Why not just use the word xenophobic . Racism is quite a loaded term and would dilute the interesting point you made .

- - Are your other personalities voices in your head that change how you think  Or are they outspoken and change how you behave 
  - The other personalities are technically voices in my head most of the time but they cant change or dictate how I think or behave .
- - I know this is very personal now  but would you like to share why christianity wasnt really right for you

- - How the fuck did I miss a nearly month old post  Must have been when I was busy for a bit with work .
  - We did nt make a huge deal out of it and it was around the busiest part of the year for a lot of us so it makes sense .
- - One question . what do you do for a living 
  - Like a lot of us with good benefits  I work in tech .
- - Like I said  those of us that are nt Cowboys fans saw what happened .
  - So you saw the facemask that Pettigrew was guilty of 
- - You ca nt blame your neckbeard on liquor . That s just cruel .
  - It s really just a really shitty chinstrap . I assure you that the hair does not extend to the neck .
- - That s fucking awesome  also I used to have a Burger King tray when I rolled my own cigarettes  best item I ever stole . . D
  - This one is glued to a beanbag and was turned into a lap tray  very handy . Thanks  thrift store 
- - You might want to add Naga and DP in there .
  - I would throw PA and Nyx in there as well just because shutting them down early still makes supports cry .
- - Except wood is porous giving bacteria infinite places to Hide . This is the health code in Iowa . I do nt know why it would be different where you are 
  - In here the bacteria does nt follow the health code .
- - This man knows his mcdonalds grill settings . The other problem is you have to clean the grill every time you switch types of meats .
  - And yet somehow Jack in The Box gets it done .
- - Could nt find a worse desktop background 
  - I work in a sensitive industry . It was a quick and dirty method of covering the company logo ...
- - What would it take to make Maurice smile .
  - He smiled with a few minutes left in the period .
- - Bad news . those are nt claims .
  - Good news . less messy and easier to clean up than many of the claims I read on a day-to-day basis 
- - You know what I think would be great  finding out Corypheus is a closet cat lover .
  - It would explain his absurd desire to take over and destroy the world .
- - All these comments about the kid being in backwards but no comments about the drop side crib 
  - There s conversion kits that keep the side from dropping  you know .
- - That s a bold statement and I do nt think there s anything to back it up .
  - There s also nothing that could back up that FSU would win . That s why IMO they should be allowed to play .
- - You re giving him too much credit  this defense is full of great players .
  - Pettine had a better D on paper  linebackers might have been a bit weaker . Schwartz got the best out of this D .
- - is nt anyone else concerned that horse has a FB and is going to message her 
  - It s probably not a real horse .
  - Probably just a pony that s cat fishing .
  - It s probably just a reverse centaur .
  - Four human legs or two  Also . how many dicks 
  - Horse upper body  human lower body .
- - Throw my phone up really high as the pack is opening and catch it again . And no  I have yet to not catch it .
  - but have you got any good players doing this 
- - I m sorry . I wish I had something profound to say to make it better .
  - Thanks for the reply anyway . I appreciate it .
- - Hey would you look at that  More evasion 
  - Hey  would you look at that  ca nt deny it with his comment history being public . I wonder why he insists Stone is a good guy ...
- - That was enjoyable  except for the giant squid fucking the elephant with a crayon .
  - How was your first time in a Walmart 
- - So just the red wont fuck his cycle up  As soon as I get home I will change it . I hope he isnt freezing .
  - It might a bit  but honestly if you ca nt replace the day bulb  it s the best option in the sense of temperature .
  - Could I just keep the red light on  but put in across from a window to let natural light in until I can get a replacement 
  - As long as it s not in a drafty area  that should be fine .
- - Or ... yaknow ... because they re Irish .
  - That was my thought as well . Thats immediately what I put together
- - Is it even worth watching  I watched one episode .
  - The short answer is no unless you want to see a poorly written trainwreck with half the production value of your average Battlestar Galactica episode .
- - He was really nice  and very humble . He has so many tapes out if u have nt heard any
  - Care to point me in the direction of some of his other material 
- - Wish I could make an honest comment here .
  - Karma does nt matter  do it anyways .
- - I believe that s the North Korea method .
  - Well it works after all they are best Korea 
- - He did nt stay and stop him . He gave him a comical kick to the butt as he made his exit .
  - He caught an attack on camera  enough to get that guy arrested .
- - Thank you for illustrating my point . Hope your new neighborhood is better  haha .
  - Oh yeah  This was when I was a kid . I m out of that beautiful sheltered bowl they call Utah and in Austin  TX now .
- - Have you tried turning it off and on again 
  - Yep . Along with game file validation .
- - Ordered a Steam Key for the complete edition last night and I m not sure if it ll come in separate keys . I ll get back to you on this .
  - Do you still have infinite season pass 
- - It s a normal pic  is it because he is nt wearing a fedora like you 
  - It has a lot to do with using a black and white filter  and the angle at which it is taken .
- - What a great play from Anderson s side  as a dutchman . In perfect condition this tournament 
  - Anderson really put it out . Wow  amazing play 
- - I m not Catholic  but I really like this pope 
  - Now  has he mentioned anything about population control 
- - An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind
  - There will be one person left with an eye ... And they will rule .
- - And you re not wrong  I suppose  But I do nt understand the point that you re trying to make 
  - It was kind of a joke  I was just defining being tone deaf and intentionally dense in a literal way .
- - That looks really great . Good job 
  - Thank you  I jumped around many different color schemes before settling on this one and I m glad I did 
- - Probably worth it though . I should look into getting one
  - Super worth it if you get their credit card 
- - Tell me again -- what is the cause that justifies throwing molotov cocktails at civilian houses 
  - I m addressing a motivation  not a justification .
- - Your card effect triggers before minion death  passive stays on untill minion dies
  - Also  a minion is nt really dead until the spell finishes casting . Therefore the passive is there until the spell ends .
- - Sorry for the late response but why do nt you just ask your friends to post you some dank  Very little risk of getting domestic packages caught .
  - Sure  Are you sweden maybe you can post some lol
- - So  being sick  and in a cut  is my body going to be burning more or less calories 
  - Well you ll likely be sedentary  so it will burn less calories .
- - Old people sure  in a situation that deserves a sir  sure . But to everyone . All the time . No sir .
  - It s a formal version of Bro . Still do nt see how it s exclusive to neckbeards
- - You choose a point value to play at . Start him on the corresponding click associated with that Point Value .
  - Ah I see it now  thank you very much
- - Would you do a pistol plus cash trade for the second aeg 
  - What pistol and how much on the side  PM me with more info please .
- - Do nt have fire  but added you anyway

- - That authorization header and HTTPs are not even required to access it . O
  - Good spot  I did nt try without them .
- - Great candid photo of cat licking it s ass in the last photo .
  - I came here to make a similar comment . We know how the cat feels about it  Seriously  great gift 
- - Do nt you mean function over form  If you valued form over function  you d be an ESFP  lol .
  - You are correct . I ve fixed it .
- - Why is it sad  Does the dog die  Shit  I was almost done reading this 
  - Oh  no nothing like that  just the emotional journey ya know
- - you should get those jeans hemmed . way too long .
  - Just Got em a couple days ago  have nt had time to
- - Imagine the same post with a huge bulge instead
  - Haha  someone should try that out and see what happens .
- - If it was already made then why not just add it immediately  Expansions I understand but this day one dlc shit has to stop .
  - Day one yeah that needs to stop . Everything else is fine as long as its not disc locked content .
- - Wahhhh ok note to self  never go back to the arctic  so many fingers lost ...
  - I knew a guy when I lived in Alberta who lost fingers from passing out in a snowbank . I always thought it was frostbite . Now I m not sure .
- - Yep  was just going to say that . It s unfortunate that i do nt like the finish because it s probably going to be one of the cheaper ones .
  - Hopefully  Ultraviolet will be cheap too . Seeing as how the hand will cover most of the purple  I think those will be pretty cool .
- - I m sorry I wasted my time .
  - No please  I almost got it 
- - Slow sports day in Minnesota to state the obvious .
  - In other words you only posted this pointless article in order to make this comment

  - Yea mid tower is the largest you can fit .
- - I like that art  but Cho looks weirdly old .
  - Agreed  I did nt even realize that that was supposed to be Cho until you mentioned it .
- - Vince  did nt HHH convince you to try to go with Reigns by now 
  - I think it s the other way around . It s Vince who backs Reigns .
- - SO YOU RE AN OLYMPIC LEVEL COMMENTER  I BET I COULD VOTE YOU DOWN ...
  - DO YOU THINK IM GON NA SIT THERE AND LET YOU DOWNVOTE ME  
- - Once again  you had support cards us Android peasants do nt have .
  - Oh sorry  I keep forgetting about those
- - I wonder if there was anything left . Did he turn to mist 
  - Perhaps initially  but after that  more of a powder  I believe .
- - You lost . You should nt have . But you did . Get over it you sound like douchebags .
  - They are referring to the people posting death threats to specific players on their Twitter account . To most sane people thats crossing the line .
- - Damn  you improved it like a million times over .
  - Thank you  I ve been in the pixel business for way too long  haha .

- - Going to Lowe s or Home Depot is always fun .
  - Too bad those stores give me a headache . And  we could do that in our hometown .
- - Well . You re an idiot . No NYC cop is going to make out with you .
