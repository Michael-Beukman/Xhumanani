- - Maybe cause your like this  they ca nt tell you .
  - I m not sure if you realise how daft that sounds 
- - Sounds awesome  Now imagine all that with Venom  Kraven or Puma as the villain stalking spidey . The subtle score building all that suspense . ooh
  - A Fincher Carnage movie would be so dark and awesome
- - In any half competent organisation you should never have to build up evidence of your own abilities to defend against others shortcomings .

  - It sounds like you do not like your brother .
- - Came here to post this . Glad to see George beat me to it .
  - No one seems to notice his username .
- - He could nt have beaten enel without his fruit though .
  - Maybe he would have focused on developing haki sooner without the fruit because he was nt naturally resilient to attacks .
  - He didnt learn about haki for a long time . Plus all of the bullets wouldve killed him sometime .

  - He killed the last unicorn and fucked it s corpse ... Kill him

- - Yes  there are loads of people who do nt mind hat justice is being served if they believe Adnan is the real killer  fuck fair trials .
  - Down voted because why  There actually many people who feel that way

- - Good on you both  Can you teach me next  I m only capable of changing the cabin filter  the CD  and the battery in the key .
  - YouTube  I m sure it s on there . It s more of an art than science . Unless you re near Asheville  then cmon over .

  - I m pretty sure Justin s is on the back of his head  under his hair .
- - I feel the Fierce Deity mask would give MM Link a massive advantage . And honestly  all the masks in general .
  - MM Link can also carry more bottles then any other incarnation of Link  which means both infinite magic for the next three days  and more fairies then anyone else .
- - A nice gas range with like eight burners ... So I have something nice to look at while eating take-out .
  - You can cook eight packages of ramen at once 
- - No stress yet  recently bought a car and it has me thinking what if I lose my job in the future .
  - I know that feeling . All the best
- - Her pool is nt useless . It is free gold when you have spell thief s line .
  - You are right  its useful in lane . But realistically compared to other supports that have utility on every ability  Morgana s pool becomes non existent .
- - I actually ordered a bikini top from them a while ago . After ordering  it said it was nt available and I never got a further response .
  - Wow ... Did they charge you for it 
- - It s a salute emoticon  I would nt be able to tell you how that specifically relates to EVE though .

  - Excellent  thank you  I ll wait then .
- - Tricky in what way  I use it and have no problems .
  - I just do nt understand it at all . YNAB is more intuitive to me . Where I had real trouble with mint was the goals .
- - Dany . Barristan is still LC so she gets killed by a manticore
  - Strong Belwas was still there . He would have killed the manticore after letting it sting her once .
- - No regrets watching that whole video . Definitely rivals the Super Chargers song .
  - Hell I open it knowing what it is  like Manning Face  and let the whole thing play every time . Never gets old .
- - Well  maybe we can also quit it with the announcing every time you get a rare Amiibo thing .
  - I Second this ... There would be a lot less posts to sift through if everyone would stop posting every time they buy an amiibo .
- - This may sound very dumb  but do you take damage if you you heal under the effect of aa s ultimate 
  - no  you literally ca nt regen or heal afaik . only way you can damage yourself is by gaining str then losing it . example is armlet toggling

  - Just in the shower wondering why some people were ticklish and why some were not . By the time I got out  this idea popped in my head .
- - Some of these patriot fans are an embarrassment to football .
  - Every team has those type of fans . Making a thread about it is just feeding them .

  - Uhg  kids  just google how it s bad for you and there are thousands of sources .
- - I strongly disagree . There were very strong Marian themes and lessons about temptation and the destructive power of greed .
  - That s does nt mean it was nt terrible .
- - So who of the new Cavs are playing tonight 
  - I doubt Mosgov will play much  if at all  but the JR will probably be coming off the bench at some point . Iman is injured

  - cool  that was quick . i bought one for the packs ... but started thinking he s a good collateral card . then i started thinking about the team .

  - Yup  I can confirm  mine had issues
- - I agree  I had my BS alarm bells ringing right off the bat  reading that post . OP should really take care dealing with this .

- - Eating seeds and having a tree growing in me .
  - the roots cant take hold in all that bubble gun youve swallowed . dont worry  youll be ok .
- - We d die eating French toast  yum . Or making sweet sweet love to it . Either way sounds good to me .
  - I guess we re in charge of bringing snacks .
- - Disagreement can be impassioned without being insulting .
  - Fair enough  but the plot of an entire episode is Seven and Naomi saving the day because they do nt give a crap about Earth .

  - Probably exactly what happened . He retired to spend time with family  he realized he missed coaching and decided to coach again .
- - It s the right approach  if disclosed privately Apple would have probably taken months to fix it .
  - Hence why many recommend to indicate a public disclosure timeframe in your private disclosure . Give them a chance to succeed before condemning them to failure .
- - The DC Animated Universe was by far the best form of an animated rendition as a comic property could receive .
  - I think Young Justice did it a little better . It was a little less of a kid s cartoon .
- - I ve been hoping for at least a new post on the Serial website . Would love to hear what SK thinks of the interviews .
  - I think her silence tells us exactly what she thinks of the interviews  much like the IP s refusal to respond to NVC .
- - If I play someone like that I just go to the other side of the stage and wait for them to get bored .
  - Absofuckinglutely I just ledge hop until they stop being a cunt
