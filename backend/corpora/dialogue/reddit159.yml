- - I really hope it s the landlords that have to answer and not the kids that get screwed .
  - It ll be the kids that get screwed
- - I got me  they got them . Besides  I can always make more children to replace them  they ca nt make another me .
  - This is the perfect opportunity for them to learn about self reliance .

  - I do nt think OP s friend even looked at the admission requirements ...
- - Do you have some difficulty understanding what a satirical news show is 
  - I m saying that some people actually count on them as their one and only source of political news  which is nt good .
- - My money is on the colts winning . Manning has been playing very mediocre lately
  - Colts are yet to beat an elite team  I do nt think that starts in the postseason on the road

  - True . But he ll be facing a much more competent pass rush . Let s hope for a good game
  - You re right . However momentum is a fickle thing and the Colts have it . I do nt see this game being over a one possession game whoever wins .
  - I think the Colts win a close won or the Broncos blow it open

  - I m not gay or anything  but I would nt mind holding it for a bit just to appreciate that girth .
- - How the fuck the did the guy get that job  I must be more than qualified .
  - Could be a last minute replacement for a sick dude 
- - food . I d just dream I m eating delicious food and wake up satisfied .
  - I do nt know  I just do nt feel like dreaming about food would leave me satisfied enough . Then again  what do I know .
- - Funny  not all refs have said that Dez coming onto the field is even a penalty . But yes  shafted .
  - Cris Carter mentioned that usually the refs warn players in situations like that . But screw job for sure .
- - If there are no laws of physics that does nt mean you can choose which ones to violate . Everything would cease to exist .
  - Yeah sorry I was tired and not thinking straight
- - I was thinking maybe it was Allstate s social media coordinator person  but she does nt look old enough ...

  - I had to look again to see what you were talking about . Ca nt unsee
- - Uhm  why do you still play this game 
  - Because i love the game  i think it s fast paced and fun .
- - Are you angry because you re incapable of logical thought 
  - not angry  just laughing at your distinct lack of intelligence . try harder .
- - What if we got weapons from side quests that were needed in the dungeons  Similar to the hookshot from the graveyard in OoT  but on a bigger scale .
  - Because then it s not a sidequest  it s the main quest .
- - Can you imagine how excited show watchers would be seeing Catelyn brought back  They d be hype as shit .
  - Such hype  which is why I want it .
- - I was kidding man . I thought it was obvious .
  - Look at the rest of the thread ... It s not so obvious  I ve reported a direct death threat to the OP already .
  - Your penis is of less than average girth .
  - Did your mom tell you that  Tell her I m sorry she was nt satisfied  but she s still not getting her money back .
- - Maybe she s upset with you because you think her legitimate gripes are simply because of PMS 
  - not OP  just thought your question had a pretty obvious answer . Also  she s not upset with him  she said she feels inadequate .
- - They should nt be able to officiate a PLAYOFF game without having any chemistry or experience working together .
  - I kind of agree . Unfortunately  they take the top guys in the league and throw them together .
- - All of them are the names of English towns 
  - Were nt the English settlers oh so creative 
- - Have you never played any other online game  This is nt a COD thing  it s an internet thing .
  - It s not as bad in co-op games though .
- - Stab in the dark  but I would first look at your SSL certificate and chain . Maybe android does not verify your certificate authority
  - Thanks will check that out . Good point
- - Um  I m pretty sure everyone wants net neutrality .
  - Not the FCC or the big cable companies
- - It s been a surprisingly long time since I last saw someone use this .
  - They got rid of the gimli novelty account
- - And you are far too sexy ... seriously after checking out your past posts  alls I can say is I ca nt wait for more .
  - Anything in particular you want to see 
- - Those are absolutely not coins  they re medallions put out by random private companies .
  - And marked up in price like crazy . I hate them .
- - In short  raise taxes on serfs instead of doing things that could create jobs or lower energy costs for serfs .
  - I m pretty sure having more money to fix infrastructure would in fact create jobs .
- - Its payback for your damn tea taxes . Throw the servers into the harbor if you want a revolution 
  - Do we also have to start a massacre outside their office 
- - GPlay have been cheating for so fucking long it s ridiculous .
  - Give me proof and I ll admit that I am a dumbass for thinking that they are nt cheating .
- - Applying Occam s Razor here . do you urinate Life cereal 
  - I had eaten it for breakfast and then my urine smelled like it .
- - Thing is  I did nt hack my lungs out the first time I took a drag of a cigarette  either .
  - It was nt really the fact that I did nt cough  it was the practiced ease with which I lit the cigarette that gave me away .
- - I used to work for a certain political party and my name is Dan
  - You guys  It s Political Dan I found him 
  - This must be fake . The real political dan is a myth
  - He s real if you truly believe in him . You know  like Santa Claus ... but real and not fake like Santa Claus .
- - I m suggesting the system is quicker to say a juvenile was mature enough to face adult consequences than it is to say one was mature enough to have adult privileges .
  - What makes you say that  Only a very tiny percentage of juvenile offenders are tried as adults . Do you know at what rate requests for adult privileges are denied 
- - what kind of cooling do you have to get air in and out of the case 
  - The default case fans . The case is definitely very cool though .
- - Exactly was I was going to post lol . Shouldnt be hard to do similar but for a fullsize .
  - It s easy to do . That post was what started spawning ideas for me .
- - I saw a post on here some time ago about your s being the only shop in Europe to carry Churchill  and the name was easy to remember .
  - Actually the second shop which carries Churchill  but one of a few . Great to hear 
- - This was a good episode  BUT  I think the later part of this stream was golden with the bicycle mayhem and Adam constantly walking into the paths of automobiles .
  - They often make two videos out of each stream so it might come up later
- - I am happy you did the work for me and linked the song . I was not disappointed  thank you
  - I try to help where I can  I thank you for your thanks .
- - What consoles  An original Xbox by chance 
  - No consoles . Games and accessories . Sorry 
- - They re both amazing . May Andy R.I.P .
  - Both were great indeed  really do miss Andy though .
- - Than I will go with an unlimited supply of incredibly attractive  available  promiscuous  woman
  - so I take it you re going to eat the woman when you run out of food
- - Obsidian Portal has a built-in forum . It s really perfect for this type of project . Got your DM  I ll shoot you an email a little bit later .
  - Oh yes it does . I ve never used the forum there .
- - You did this on the toilet . Two birds with one stone  eh 
  - The toilet is my short term refuge from two little ones . Lol
- - Ricks right hand looks detachable ... wonder why ... 
  - He comes with an alternate bandaged hand .
- - Clean fresh mountain air . Not that shitty version the sell in stores  but the actual smell you find in nature .
  - Especially with a pine forest . Ca nt go wrong with a pine forest .
- - It s also fucked up racially too  it s really a feast of fucked up shit and biases
  - How so  So many people talk about the shitty romance  but that s never mentioned .
- - I have an EE degree and my job title is software engineer .
  - Do you literally just code all day 
- - I figured I might as well own it .
  - I m glad you owned it . Says a lot about you . I assume your a good person now 
- - I wish we could have seen The Undertaker vs ECW Zombie  I can see the headline ; THE Deadman vs A Deadman
  - Funny you say that . The guy that played the zombie died a few days ago .
- - I am the biggest GB fan right now . Please Aaron Rodgers ... please please beat them down .
  - You have no idea how hard it will be for me to root for gb next week  but I will .
- - Jesus . Is the point of that wall just to break stuff  Looks like everyone who did it got some major damage .
  - It was built to do back flips . Results may vary
- - You re an idiot   with a snuggly tone and deep eye contact works
  - Even if I m messing around this would hurt my boyfriend s feelings . So  yeah .
- - Well  maybe it would be wise for me to us np links after this if this becomes a problem ...
  - I m not blaming you  I think the bot posts either way  honestly .
- - But I feel like it s visible when I do try to treat it .
  - Yes . It is also visible now so what is the difference  If you must just apply a thin layer on more frequently
- - No  there were no extra screws  which made this mildly infuriating too .
  - At that point I d just go grab the nail gun .
- - Technically the country was nt founded then  it was just a penal colony .
  - But it did arise from the penal colony did it not 
- - Ah well I only browse new so I had nt seen that
  - GUYS  I FOUND HIM  I FINALLY FOUND HIM 
- - I get SUPER excited every time  and then ultimately let down whenever I open it .
  - I m glad I got to let you down
- - Hey . Guess what  I believe in you 
  - That s really encouraging to hear . Thanks 
- - Wow  you re some kind of diabolical mastermind . Do you have any siblings  It s as if your father handed you powers
  - Hard-earned powers  I suppose ... I m like the Karate Kid when it comes to dodging random smacks upside my head  too ...
- - Hey  Have you hugged an idiot today  no  Me neither  come here 
  - You re harmless  but woefully uneducated on the subject .
- - wow  what a great masquerade . i hope the victims will try to make enough lawsuits ...
  - Sometimes people think genuinely that they are not scam artists . They simply think they are good people and ca nt conceive that they are the bad actor .
- - Remote possibilities  You ve just named my Three Big Hats that I m currently wearing .
  - Sorry no remote possibilities  being onsite is required . PM me if you re still interested 
- - It d be like killing an enemy with a laser weapon in Fallout
  - And like fallout we can search the ashes and take some items lel 
- - Do nt worry  I m working on finding a better monitor . By the way my dad is fine  I just built this without him .
  - Oh good  I though he died .
- - Why the fuck are you all Spurs fans 
  - Well the article is about a Spurs player  so seeing a lot of Spurs fans comment on it makes sense .
- - honestly  Avatar is pratically the same as Doctor Who . they can continue this forever
  - They could  I doubt that they will though
- - Oh god  eating a burger with a fork is such a deal breaker 
  - Haha . I was just trying to come up with an absurd example . Any reason is better than no reason or some vague it s me not you  bs .
- - Both from what I ve read . He s loaned until the end of the season and then Inter will buy him in the summer .
  - That s correct . It s only because inter have been in trouble with FFP
- - Is it really hard to believe that just maybe they protected a guard because they actually valued his life as a human being 
  - simply for the altruistic purpose of helping him  I have my doubts . we are speaking about convicted murderers  thieves  sexual offenders here ...
- - Hmm  well balls . I guess I ll dismantle it then .
  - By all means try it out first mate . My post is just my opinion  does nt mean that it s the same thing for you .
- - Do nt age a beer if you do nt know what it tastes like fresh .
  - I may just have to crack that open tonight then
- - Yes . We have begun development  not in beta yet unfortunately .
  - Please post here again when you have a public Android beta - I ll gladly test it . Options for UK rail planning on Android are surprisingly lacking 
- - Crushed by the weight of a million golden coins
  - Here  let me get you started .
- - They ... They ca nt triple OT ... Can they 
  - They do what they want in the playoffs .
- - Anyone use it in the crucible  If so how does it hold up 
  - Imo for crucible you need proximity detonation and tracking in that order to make a rocket launcher useful
- - Just Idly Curious  but is there a place where you aired your complaints  or do you just air them in conversation 
  - Mostly conversation . Occasional comment boards . I have nt put together a blog post or anything .
- - He would definitely get more time here at Chelsea . Robben is entrenched in the RM  where as Willian is nt as much .
  - He ll be looking for a team in which he ll be first choice .
- - Is China still developing  It s grouped into the second category of Former and Current Communist Regimes in my Comp Gov textbook .
  - They have a really big economy but the gdp per capita isnt all that high . Theyre on the high end of developing nations
- - It does nt sound like debug mode is enabled on his phone . If it is nt then adb commands will not work .
  - So bottom line  there s no hope 
- - Looks good but they could have done better with the egg .
  - Agreed  it was still pretty yummy though .
- - they arent going to get that opportunity because they will be blown out of the state of Wisconsin next week
  - Cowboys beat Seattle the same team who raped GB
  - Doesnt mean a thing . Anything can happen in a single game in the NFL
  - So the Cowboys winning Is possible then since you said ANYTHING can happen .
  - But that was that day . It will be a different game this time  thats if they even make it
  - Uhhhh yea ok . It will be DIFFERENT game alright .
- - A good place to look is Pintrest . Lots of impressive work gets compiled there .
  - Thanks I clearly didnt think of that site . D
- - I feel like this is the best day so far . Also I do nt think chicken is good for Brad . I could be wrong though .
  - Are nt pandas supposed to be carnivorous 
- - Buy the g-horn  i have no time to explain .
  - I shed a tear every day remembering how stupid I was ...
- - I really  really like this picture .
  - His expression is perfect . He looks so proud .
- - Pretty sure everyone knows what the problem is . This has been discussed to death here . There s pretty obvious solutions too  not sure what your point is .
  - If this has been discussed to death  then how do you not see his point 
- - Are you sure she s of Lebanese origins 
  - Yeah and they re not too fond about it .
- - This is a joke play on Lampard s situation  surely 
  - Lampard s situation is different because he was signed to a team that did nt really exist yet though
- - She d hate that you d leave without telling her  or even leave in the first place ... she really looks up to you ...
  - She does  What do you mean she looks up to me 
- - The crusades would like a word with you .
  - That was like forty years ago  get over it
- - I bet your work freedom is both infuriating and brilliant at the same time . I can never decide which one
  - Annoyingly  I come home knackered some days and know my wife has had a harder day .
- - Also remember Perez is coming back mid season . Yu  Holland  Perez . If Harrison can come back that would be huge .
  - Perez will be back  but it seems to take another half or even full year for pitchers to actually return to full effectiveness after Tommy John .
- - I have no idea what s going on at this point . And Twitter seems broke right now
  - Sure it . Thought it was the only one .
- - Ice like sonic  Like in the shape of little hedgehogs with running shoes or something 
  - Haha  like little  thin  hollow  cylinders
- - As you get older  lunch by yourself becomes awesome 
  - Getting to spend an hour not having to talk to anyone or do anything other than read my book and eat is sometimes the highlight of my day .
- - Daddy Petan throwing the hat onto the ice It s an onion massacre .
  - Guaranteed the man s never been happier to throw something away .
- - Probably CEC . The remote is Bluetooth .
  - yup CEC . on a side note  the fire tv box works with FLIRC to allow for infrared remote use as well
- - So I guess you saw this comment coming .
  - I should ve made it clearer that its spoken word . not typed word . sorry 
- - I never made the connection between klk and rwby till now
  - Neo and Nui were compared from the second Neo took that parasol away from her face .
- - Most Swiss people can speak High German .
  - This is true . However  they were speaking Swiss German to the High German speaker . Still understood each other .
- - I thought it was just because it looked like Meta Knight was rubbing his ass in Snake s face .
  - haha that s what i thought at first
- - WE NEED TO GET ALL THREE OF THAT CRAP .
  - we need the lock ... and the key because then we ll have both the lock ... and the key
- - If he s taking certain medication that can cause problems . I had that same issue with an ex . She took it personally but it wasnt her fault .

  - He does nt give up and She never forgets ...

  - We have one already . We just used teamspeak for the meeting

  - I understood Raloxifene is slower to act than Nolva though .
- - Climate change SJWs are going ape shit over cheap petrol . D
  - You think it s going to last 
- - Nope  he s sending it on escrow .
  - The OP said he FE d . Vendor s send when funds in escrow of course but onus is on the receiver to finalise .
- - Seton Hall has quickly come onto my radar ... Two huge wins this past week  and they ve looked good doing so .
  - I would say Seton Hall too except that s probably not the case anymore after the Nova win .
- - Holy shit what the fuck was that  
  - The loser had to jump . Naw . Really some guy tried to kill himself by jumping off the roof .
- - I m thinking possibly a head  and arms and legs  But really  sometimes the head sets the mood for the rest of the creature .
  - I have a mask in mind  I just have to find it . The old infected Hau
- - Yeah but then you get a finger in your butthole
  - You say that like it s a bad thing .
- - Or a helicopter parent to see it and brigade to get him fired .
  - I hate it when my parents propellers need fixed .
- - Also  this is a cash grab how 
  - Since I ve repeatedly said all I really want is an apology and for him to stop selling the shirts  I m not sure either .
- - Thanks . I play NW all the time on Injustice .
  - cool  glad i could help . just a basic primer to get comfortable with how his combos work .
- - Did you just diss Olive  bro 
  - Olivia is a saint  this guy needs to watch his mouth 
- - Good thing I m not a country  I m a person  and I have every right to criticize a country for its practices on other people .
  - Criticize as much as you please bud  though some of your criticisms are baseless .
- - That was a pretty dull trailer  to be completely honest .
  - Maybe  but I remember how awesome the trailer for the Silver Surfer was and look how that turned out

  - Oh man ... If they did that  I would never get anything done .
- - That s a nice ass for someone so slender .
  - Thanks  I m quite proud of it .
- - Crap ... Well now I m a tad worried . Hopefully it being after Christmas is better .
  - I m still trying to get a refund for the RMA  it wont be for another week till I hear aback from them apparently .
- - All they re talking about is how the Ravens are so great and they re going to beat the Pats . Good .
  - I caught that too . Then they all picked the Steelers to win ...
- - If they do make fun of you like that  they are horrible people ... I hope things get better for you  friend .
  - Its texas  It s FILLED with horrible people . cx and thanks

  - Yeah Ziggy already got what he wanted . I doubt he cares .
- - Transgender is also a mental disorder . Try finding Jesus my friend
  - Sigh . Even when I ask direct questions you ca nt help but troll . Well I tried . My duty here is complete .
- - Or just use an imgur upload app or web browser 
  - Emailing would work well from a phone  especially if you want to do it rapidly . I agree though  it s just one additional avenue .
- - You can check out any time you like  But you ca nt never leave .
  - I m confused . So you can leave then 
- - How about the textbook itself  Any issues with it 
  - I think its a poorly written book . The publisher being horrible is just the final nail in the coffin .
- - If you want  I can help assigning tech scores for the different sides .
  - I ll pm you if I ever need to .
- - I noticed they did nt show any scenes of him growing  I wonder if they re keeping that aspect of his powers a surprise .
  - I was more concerned that they completely eliminate it . Today s trailers always give away too much so i hope this wasnt the case . It would make him irrelevant .
- - RoT has the cult order . I guess that was unimportant for horde .
  - Ahh right . I only have Hoard at this stage . I suppose the cult order becomes much more important later on then .
- - I still have to read that book . I did enjoy the movie however .
  - The movie is definitely good and a decent adaptation . Do read the book though . I enjoyed it more than I expected .
- - An individual developer is a person . Valve is nt . See the difference 
  - A company is the sum of it s employees ... How can you criticize a company but not it s people  That makes no sense .
- - Mechs are not the issue . Players are .
  - Sometimes I would agree with that  sometimes I think it s an issue of both .
- - So without the bully Eminem might have never came in to being .
  - Most definitely . Although deAngelo himself just represents all the abuse and hatred over the years when eminem refers to him by name in his songs .
- - Not sure why Infowars seems to be on board that this actually happened as reported too . They cry false flag everywhere else and this has all the makings of one .
  - Because it demonize the enemies of their owners .
- - Those are nt better sources dude  they have no relationship to your original statement .
  - What do you mean  It confirms that most muslims asked do want the harsh punishments of sharia law applied .
- - Definitely the right answer . The problem with muh thyroid  is that it means that people think all people who say they have a thyroid condition are just making excuses .
  - Yeah it s the fatlogic idiots that make the people with the actual problem look bad .
- - Why someone close to Puget  I m just south of there .
  - So that they can walk into the office and buy the port assembly for me  then ship it to me .
  - I ll see if I can get up there and do it  no promises .
  - if that does nt work out im close as well
- - I digitally painted before  but never did traditional painting or drawing . The Time thing is pretty spooky though  I have no idea what happened  my life is ridiculous
  - good stuff . thanks for replying and best of luck 
- - Unpopular opinion . Datsyuk leads with his elbow in most of the hits people have linked to in this thread .
  - It s unpopular because it s wrong . He tucks his elbow then flares it out to provide more push momentum to knock his opponent over while maintaining his own balance .
- - Do I want to play excel spreadsheet hmm that s a tough one
  - Everyone uses GDocs now . In all seriousness  the game s changed a lot . Definitely worth a revisit .
- - The Great Wall is the only one of the seven wonders that can be seen from space . Not true . You ca nt see it from space unaided .
  - Seriously  the lack of oxygen would definetly kill you .
- - Second season got announced months ago . The second OVA is coming out in April  check MAL the next time .
  - When is teh second season gon na come out then 
- - Were you ice skating on top of that lake of death from lord of the rings 
  - Were you ice skating on top of that lake of death from lord of the rings 
- - Do the younger girls not have to be covered up so that the men can pick which ones they want to rape 
  - They just play it safe and rape everyone
- - people said that to the original guy in the original thread too . He had nt responded when I last saw that comment thread
  - Ah  yes I see that now . As usual I am late to the party .
- - I m waiting for the shitstorm that brews on this sub when we do nt get Okafor .
  - i just want a player that is nt a bust
- - It s one of the few schools with a decent program for Law Enforcement wannabes though . I ll take the lack of liquor for education .
  - And  arguably  thus begins an unhealthy relationship with alcohol .
- - You re getting down voted but I agree . At the very least  I see more people refusing to drink there than going in because of this joke .
  - The people throwing a fit never went there in the first place .
- - If you were scared of either of those teams  how would you survive the rest of the playoffs
  - I do nt think I can survive . Unless we are taking a knew to close out a game I am never enjoying it .
- - Mai thai . Best Thai in Columbia 
  - Is that the one near Lexington hospital 
- - Greenville . Best . ECU Worst . ECU
  - God . the bar I cook at shows every ECU game and its almost unbearable . PURPLE  GOLD 
- - The DFPRS shares in your sorrow comrade  it is a shame to see trusted friends to be hurt in such ways  let us end this cult 
  - Ah  the new Russian nation . Thank you for your concern .
- - But those are nt metals they re gases
  - Yeah I think someone hit me on the head or something before I wrote that post . Sorry . P
- - Where did you get the Darksiders Death Mask 
  - A special edition  Someone probably still sells this .
- - Well you only helped him due to his thin privilege shitlord 
  - Hey  if I wan na help someone with thin privilege than I will  It is my right as a shitlord to do so 
- - I d love to see a Great Expectations review 
  - Me too  I have nt played with these much 
- - Then a phone screen  But seriously  I also have little to no idea what I m seeing .
  - Oh  yeah  I have no clue what I m looking at either .
- - He s out of stock again . Good job to whoever got him .
  - Not true  I just saw him up again . Keep refreshing 
- - Well  unusually kind words . Thank you  Great year and good luck next year . Please get rid of Suh ... that guys a dick .
  - I have no hatred for Green Bay  they re a solid football team  probably because my best friend is a huge GB fan . I hate the bears more .
- - How fucking retarded do you have to be to look up cold symptoms 
  - A strawman level of retarded  I guess .
- - You inspired me with one idea and I m seriously considering with going for it . So thanks ...
  - Best of luck let us know how it turns out 
- - That was about the Prison downstairs which lies open . The wall stands on the ground . You do nt have to be an engineer to build a wall .
  - Or  you know  pick up crap off the floor in some of the rooms .
- - Great choices . Especially Paul Dano as Harold and Andy Serkis as Trashcan .
  - I would love to see Andy Serkis as Trashcan .
- - Does your county have a domestic relations office 
  - I do nt believe so  as a google search did nt turn anything up .
- - That was upside down  not backwards . You suck
  - I flipped every single letter upside down  and then put the text in reverse order . If you look very carefully  you can see it starts with a Z .
- - I agree . But his point was that one can only question after having evidence .
  - But your question was about the common man not being able to ask questions at all .
- - She failed the test . The Empress forcefully inserted the egg and most likely used her finger nails to puncture or scratch the vajayjay while doing so .
  - Also  they are both hot imo and I would not kick either of them out of my bed .
- - What s that supposed to be . Not sure it s working on my phone .
  - It s a cool site to see distant stars .
- - The Sultan s back  PK looks great . Coincidence 
  - That PK made me feel bad for the guys on the ice for the PP . And that takes a lot at this point .
- - Right   Man I miss Chico s ...
  - I miss that dirty  sweaty  remote city . Chico s may be the best thing it had to offer  but it was home .
- - Noobie here ; is there a reason for those with better gear than he s selling to buy them 
  - If you have or want to do the Shattered Memory Fragment bounty  yes .
- - I find that wearing a weight vest allows me to surprise my enemies when I remove it mid-battle and become stronger and faster than they previously thought me to be .
  - I find that wearing a weighted turban also allows me to do that .
- - This is anime original right  We should nt have to worry about spoilers
  - I m sure it wo nt be completely original and also people should still tag manga spoilers for people that s wan na read the manga
  - I think it is . The author clearly says the anime will have a different ending comparing the manga .
  - Got ta point this out  that the mangas end was crap and confusing af
- - Ba da ba ba ba  I m lovin it .
  - I hated when people would sing that at work haha .
- - Sent offer also how much more would you pay for a bta looking awp
  - Really depends on the awp . Let me look at your inventory
- - As a muslim with jewish friends  there is nothing inherently islamic about jew hating . Its more of a culture thing .
  - It seems to me that you are the Muslim with radical views .
- - Rhaenys ... ca nt handle another Targaryen who did nt die
  - Rhaegar . Robert just knocked the wind out of him at the Trident . He swam away then became the three eyed crow .
- - Sorry  I do nt own this game 
  - You click the link and play it on the computer 
- - I ve been in the Army for a long time . It s a pretty safe bet
  - Still a generalization to say every military person is fucked up .
- - Id love help with crota and the stream sounds pretty fun and generous
  - Thanks  man  I really hope we can get enough people interested because I really want to do this .
- - Suddenly Ryuunosuke is my favourite character in this show .
  - Climbing my list fast  I know what you mean

- - I m online in my friendlist or do I have to get online in the game 
  - yeah . you have to be on the pss
- - For you high data users - are you watching all these vids on the phone or throwing it to a tv with Chromecast or something 
  - Both  in my case . But definitely more on phone .
- - He and Theodore were the Team Canada shutdown line .
  - A shut down line that that provided a tonne of offense .
- - I m not worried we have the pieces to make it back to the finals . Unlike other teams
  - That is proven and true . Let s just hope Timmy does nt dislocate his hip .
- - Why did they not just raise them and leave them up 
  - They re power lines for the trams .
- - I have a bad  bad feeling about this .
  - I beleive we all do  unfortunately .
- - Oh boy  how do the refs help them this time 
  - lol did you not see that hold 
  - Yeah  but I saw a few holds by the Cowboys Oline too . Oh well .
  - There was for sure . There were also some not called on the lions
- - That s what you re assuming he s saying . I obviously disagree .
  - I suppose its possible I may have misunderstood him  then .
- - Hey remember when we had Barry Church as our entire defense  That was awesome
  - hey remember when i drank all this whiskey
- - This just in . who really gives a fuck 
  - This just in . not everyone is cynical and bitter .
- - Iranian checking in . Looks like you also get some red in your beard . My dad said it has something to do with the area we are from .
  - Persian with no red . Guess we re not from the same area .
- - SEC east is nt the real SEC  now Mississippi is nt the real SEC  who is next 
  - At what point can we just narrow it down to Alabama 
- - Guy gets his keys stolen from a scumbag . Then he steals his account and gets it banned .
  - How did he steal your keys in the first case and how did you hack him for doing so  The editing in the video is confusing
- - And yet  he lives on in our heart .
  - He reminds me of me  but without the living on in peoples heart part .
- - Nice  Looks like Oreo s  Double stuff is my favorite  Hahaha 
  - I find the double stuff to be too creamy

  - It s a good city  I spent the first twenty five years of my life there . I love Oklahoma dearly .
- - I do nt know ... the fleshlight blew my mind .
  - I was talking about this specific product ... is it really that good  I have always wondered .
- - Men with back fat . They can have a belly ... but not a fat back .
  - How does that even work  Where does the fat go 
  - I think it was referring to the lower back or love handles  I ca nt imagine someone having significant amounts of fat on the lats or upper back .
  - That s what did nt understand . Did nt even think about love handles . That makes sense .
- - The dark wig they make her wear is so bad though .
  - Yeah -- I do nt understand that . But oh well . I guess it s maybe to emphasize she was young and edgy .
- - Downloading as we speak  This is one game I have no problem pre ordering 
  - Same here . Sad that we ll have to wait so long to actually play it .
- - this is like the third time I ve seen this posted  are the mods removing it 
  - they removed mine too . I asked them and it was because of her nipples showing  as shes a minor .
- - Rewatch it and record it off a camera on a tripod for all I care I just need to see this hahaha
  - Yes please I want to see this haha
- - No item  but it is the witch doctor in the black market . You will get there once you have gotten to Helios City .
  - Actually  you will need the metal coat if Im not mistaken
  - I meant no item that allows you to trade  I assume OP knows the metal coat is needed to evolve D. Scyther
  - And if OP needs a metal coat  you get one off a magnemite in cyan cavern . Use a pokemon with the ability Frisk to find one holding the item
- - To be fair  Windwaker and Sunshine are also two of the longest series on the channel as a whole . They draw the eye
  - And they are both newer well appreciated games .
- - Looks fine  but the temper may have been messed with .
  - maybe I figure Al receiver or upper would have started to melt at that point but I m not a metallurgist
- - I ve never heard of this sub  Upon reading the sub description maybe this article would ve best been served over there as a statement .
  - It s pretty funny at times . Lots of good frugal tips 
- - Do nt forget ceramic bearings . U know for speed .
  - U mean for rust  Because only the bearing balls rust not the casing .
- - Firing Erick Rowan is like firing a special needs kid .

  - Even if you just use your car to sleep in  it s still a car .
- - Salman Rushdie should be more grateful to the religion that gave him his heightened prominence .
  - Are you referring to Islam  the religion that wants to kill him 
  - So far it s been way more pro than con for him .
  - Because he s rich  How much money would I have to pay you to be in constant fear for your life 
- - If you think like that  the terrorists have won ...
  - Well it s hard to win when it seems like they re the only ones who PTFO .
- - While the question does nt specifically say a chicken egg  I think that argument is kind of silly .
  - well ... yeah . My comment was a silly way to point out a flaw in your post . It was nt an actual argument .
- - Just so long as the words ILLEGAL are stamped across the top . Then when they get pulled over for speeding or DUI  they can immediately be deported .
  - Just like ICE is swarming the DMV to arrest people standing in line to obtain licenses specifically designed for illegals .
- - Little known fact that Steve-O fucking loves cranberries .
  - Danny is probably gon na get a letter from Steve-O reading this . Dear Danny  C
- - Post rock was always my studying music back when i was in school  i also prefer no vocals when having to really focus on something .

  - Nice  I ca nt wait . They better play well
- - Does he take antidepressants  specifically ssri s 
  - I do nt think so ... But that s too personal for my relationship with him . And he s had the problem for years .
- - Take an Ibuprofen  it reduces inflammation which is most likely the cause of the pain .
  - But what s causing the inflammation  That should be addressed before going to the anti-inflammatory medication .
- - Do you mind swatching the Poe  It looks amazing
  - I can try in a bit . Never did a swatch before
- - Also  it forces you to use these crappy pedals . Just package the tech into a small package which you can put in the seatpost or the bottom bracket .
  - The whole point is that they re powered by spinning your pedals . Anything you put in your seatpost  you ll have to remember to charge every month .
- - I m confused  do women have to charge their vaginas every night or something 
  - Im not saying she s frigid  but when she opens her legs the lights come on ...
- - thank god we did nt have these refs against UL
  - The way we were shooting  it probably would nt have made a difference .
- - Just like anyone who believes anything  ever

- - Anyone else really struggle to read anything in that article 
  - Yeah  I m still not sure what it does ... the pictures are pretty though .

- - Huh  I ve never heard of him . Thanks for the suggestions 
  - Not typically into Westerns  but he s a wizard with words  I thank my husband for the introduction .
- - Well prepare to lose it . they are wiping the hive soon
  - About that  they are wiping the public hive only  right 
- - Since we are all getting raped we might as well try and enjoy it .
  - You know you can invest and get in on the action right  Go see a planner  it s easier and requires less than you think .
- - I guess the age might not mean anything then  I could nt find any on eBay with the same kind of patina .
  - probably still not as old as it looks ...
- - If your in US - Canada  you can buy good Pre Built at NCIX . But the best is building your own  it s fun  better and cost less
  - Do you recommend a certain tutorial for the build 
- - Meh  it will go away eventually . I mostly just fill the void with Netflix .
  - Well that s one way to do it .

  - a very good example of a base model . has character of its own but still easy to dress
- - You totally do nt  post removed . You ca nt develop a Belgian gun from it s own derivative .
  - Read above response  I m dumb and easily confused .
- - How does that have anything to do with the situation 
  - I m not sure . Do nt think it does ...
- - Excellent story  OP . Looking forward to more .
  - Thank You  I will try to find some time for more writing this week 
- - I would pay off my medical bills .
  - if you do nt mind me asking  what happened

  - And I still think West Virginia is too far ...
- - A Philly Realist by me lol its on soundcloud  if you like lyricism youll love it . thanks for consideration

- - I meant of current Brian or even the replacement school photo
  - ah yeah  that would ve been nice
- - Its unfortunate because it appears it was on BBC in England . I wish someone had streamed that channel .
  - It was not on there  just they showed the goals as they happened for every game in FA cup .
- - I got a fist to the ear once  Felt like a rock hit my head .
  - Be glad you did nt get one from a professional athlete .
- - And then rockets fan started complaining about free throws even though the bulls played them soft in the paint all game .
  - You re right . All this bullshit could be avoided if we just acknowledge facts . That is what occurred in terms of the peace .
- - As long as it s real mayo  not miracle whip
  - Miracle Whip is nt mayo  it s horse semen . I only use Hellmann s .
- - At work  just ate my lunch . Big tasty and double cheeseburger from MacDonald s .
  - Lucky . What s you occupation if you do nt mind me asking 
- - So new skins means that slaughter is now shitty 
  - From what I m seeing on this lovely sub  yes ... Yes it is

  - What s your in-game name  I ll promote you
- - I ve never been to a Christian Church with any kind of dress code . What denomination are you thinking of 
  - Non denominational church . But the people were very traditional . Probably an Asian thing .
- - I really did nt think my situation could be much worse . Turns out it can be . I know only some of your pain . Bro hugs .
  - Worst part of it was having to watch them sleep on the same couch together on New Year s . I guess this too shall pass for both of us mate
- - If they re extremely desperate they will .
  - If they are in a position of vulnerability they may take a job . They ll also take the better one when it comes along .
- - Do nt beat it with a sledgehammer when it misreads games
  - Probably would have done that a few years ago  but probably not now lol
- - Good work by NBC on that playoff montage . Lot of history right there .
  - Agreed . Anytime I can see Montana to Clark  I can smile the rest of the day .
- - I m not sure why Western progressive types idolize it so much .
  - They idolize a lot of things they do nt understand .
- - That answers my question . Many thanks 
  - np thanks for the gold and good luck
- - I hope they planned this ahead of time . Being forced to say yes because you get proposed to in front of thousands of people watching is nt right .
  - I doubt they specifically planned out the details of the proposal  but it s very likely that they had generally talked about marriage and their plans for their future .
- - All these hindsight comments got me in a good mood .
  - What happened to prices  Why that stickers and capsules got that expensive 
- - I do nt suppose you like the Lego movie  do you 
  - After watching it four times this year I have come to the conclusion that yes  I enjoyed it .
- - NY  Cali and Fl have a three way
  - I can totally see that ... I m sure CA would want to film it

  - Why would you even hate someone for their nationality
