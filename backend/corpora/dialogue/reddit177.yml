  - Not to mention they charge their students for almost everything .
- - Not to be the weird one or anything  but did you get a tattoo between the first and second to last picture 
  - Yeah I got the tattoo in the middle of the year . The first Ivy was more towards the beginning of the year .
- - If that s true then play how you like  which is fun  and do nt sweat the bounties .
  - pretty much this  and then its just like oh cool I cleared another bounty  it just happens when it happens

- - Right  which is the only reason to really be there . Use the hay in your fort to jump off high places without taking damage .
  - Ohh I was actually wondering if that worked  thanks 
- - His uncle said that and Andre denied it after .
  - He has to deny it so I has some bargaining chips .
- - One of Rides best lines  especially with dat rasta flare .
  - For sure . The delivery on this entire song makes it one of my favorite DG songs .

  - The only rule I know of is the DNA must survive . Whatever it takes .
- - Sounds like you re not ready for bitcoin . Banks still exist and all so I guess you re in luck

  - Why did nt you play that first 
- - I really hope it was on purpose ... The drills are nt off balance so they should nt flail your ship around like that .
  - Maybe they should have a gyro effect though  since they are rotating .
  - Perhaps  but the actual gyroscope block should easily be able to compensate for that no 
  - You would also be able to minimize the gyroscopic effects by having half of your drills rotate clockwise and the other counter-clockwise .
- - Thanks for the tips . Will incorporate them to the next edition 
  - No problem  I think it s a great idea . I like the Gracie breakdowns  but I much prefer to read things rather than have to watch a video .

  - I m not sure you re correct there .
- - Another thing  why are people so bent out on getting another wide receiver  Why pay big for a receiver like Gordon or Bowe when we have good receivers here 
  - It s off season and FA WRs are exciting to imagine

  - Decaf coffee is the devil s work .

  - My worst fear is that he gets traded and becomes Godmode Hamilton again .
- - Best music to fuck to  Albums  playlists  etc 
  - Any music . I ve made Slipknot work .
- - I think Hbox uses Z for L-cancels  not aerials . There s no way he uses only Z for his aerials  it just does nt work with the character .
  - No I m pretty sure in a video he said he used z for aerials and tap jump
- - We really should ve counted how many times they ve talked about bats

  - you need one because of all the ... lawyers
- - Is the server acting up for anyone else right now 
  - Yep . Just taken down for emergency maintenance . Hooray for compensation gems  lol
- - If we could snag Pep Hamilton  that would be SWEET . Not really reasonable or likely  but he s my favorite .
  - Pep Hamilton sounds like a shitty character from a Dr. Who spinoff .
- - It d be interesting to see this done using their QBR for each start  I feel that does a much better job assessing a QB s overall performance
  - Nice try  ESPN s PR department .
- - She is a rich girl from Texas so I m sure they paid top dollar
  - You realize that she has saved more animals than you ever will 
  - You have no idea how many animals I ve saved . And I did nt have to kill any .
  - Ok  well how many have you saved

  - Ah alright . I m low on cash . Might try one out though .
- - I love mine . What switches did you get 
  - Cherry MX Reds  I like them so far . What about you 
  - Brown switches . Feel great  and quiet as hell with the rubber o-rings on them .
  - I was thinking about those but I just love the sound of the keys when they go down  it s music to my ears .

  - Also  it s all about voice tonality and facial expression .

  - You did the same thing I did  it s okay .
- - One wrong justifies another  Come on now .
  - One wrong doesnt justify another  especially when the wrong he is talking about is made up bullshit
- - I can show you some hungarian peasantry . Our peasants are the worst in the world . They think they are elite because their games released before the PC version .
  - Err  all peasants think that . Like with GTA V. EDIT . Despite the fact that we re getting an indisputably better version of the game .
  - maybe not . for example  i dont like the current gen hud  font and that bluish fog on both current gen consoles
  - Part of it being great is the ability do mod it .

- - The American Space Agency will be allowed to use Cascadian facilities if they wish .
  - We thank you for the offer . The budget will first need to be approved by congress and signed into law by the President before the Agency will be created .

  - Never mind that  sit still and this will be all over soon .
- - to what  just a windows phone 
  - To all windows devices windows phones as well
- - Just cave and bought another RS Pack . THanks 
  - It s the right move . Maxing them out allows you to bring more quickly .
- - Any one else think this might be Paul Rudd  Username 
  - Why does everyone think I m PAUL Rudd

  - Well look again  perhaps it will come you .
- - Well in Into darkness  Kirk got demoted for interfering with an uncivilized species when he stopped the super volcano .

  - Except Jimmy wo nt foul Harden but Harden may end up in foul trouble before too long .
- - If she s washing her asshole three times a day it must be ready for licking at all times . Maybe she bathes after going to the toilet .
  - Bum gun . In Thailand people do nt just wipe with toilet paper  everyone uses a sprayer to clean first .
- - I think not having the item is a good indicator that it s not released . Receiving the item confirms it s release .
  - i do nt know what op was expecting other than that
- - Guardian tears will be flowing  no doubt
  - and there will be lots of jumping in the abyss
- - Why do people care about his opinions anyway  He is one of the biggest degenerates out there and has nothing to do with the current scene .
  - A valid point is worth considering from anyone .
- - Mason is such a stud . Hate to think where this team would be without him .
  - It feels really nice knowing we have frank for the next two years . He is already very good and can only get better
