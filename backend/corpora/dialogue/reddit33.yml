  - How is not a good cover  The guy played it almost prefect

  - And here all this time I was thinking Marvel had genetically engineered an intelligent  talking raccoon with Bradley Cooper s voice .

  - No  but there is a donation option . No one knows how many people donate because Ragen is not very forthcoming about that stuff .

  - Me too . At least Boxer is closer to a liberal than Feinstein is  who is a total DINO  I swear .
- - This is nt rage . If people actually believe this shit  it s helping the species in the long run .

  - A lot are  I met a nice trans guy at my endocrinologist a few months ago  seemed early in his transition  but did nt seem depressed .
- - That s totally wrong  as far as the device has the battery connected there s no problem at all .
  - Oh okay . So  I ll get it by ems 
- - Do a basic strength workout at lunch alternated with HIIT and go for a walk in the evening . Details in the wiki .
  - Can you direct me to the wiki you re referring to 
- - Wind farms are too powerful  How is this an argument against them 
  - It s not that they re too powerful . It s that they generate electricity when people do nt need it .
- - Do you think this is how God views our world 
  - He would also see all of time at once  as well .
- - lol my favorite recent one was the person that submitted a LPT on how to take off a sweatshirt
  - Instructions unclear . Windpipe being crushed by drawstring .

  - You might be surprised . Nothing is guaranteed . Nothing . A little extra cash is ALWAYS nice .
- - I just looked those up  there are too many Rob Lowes out there
  - I  for one  love those commercials .
- - I ve never gone to the place but you ve piqued my interest ... I ll be rolling there with a red throwback Brady jersey ...
  - As will I . We should have a secret signal ...
- - Better coke than beheading people or blowing themselves up .
  - Nice to see that I m not the only one that actually saw this as a step forward for Islam .
- - Kind of off topic  but how do you live in your car  I do nt understand how that s possible .
  - Not comfortably . Most people sleep in the back seat . I personally found it more comfortable to sleep in the front seat with the seat down .
- - That s strange ... That she d subject three more to a broken home because she wants to control therapy . It s good that you were willing to do therapy .
  - I m willing to do anything . My kids deserve the best and I want to give them best  but a broken home is not good for anyone .
- - I enjoyed all the movies immensely . Maybe a story from the Silmarillion will be adapted one day .
  - Wo nt  Tolkien Estate refuses to sell the rights .
- - Hey everyone  get financial advice from the guy who ca nt afford stocks 
  - I hope that s a joke because my personal finances have absolutely no effect on the validity of what I said .
  - It absolutely does . It shows you do nt have any fucking idea what you are talking about .
  - I hope you feel better soon from whatevers causing you to be a prick and preventing you from making any sense . Good luck .
- - We have some of the most attractive players in the league already  and now this guy arrives . I guess this is some grand marketing scheme to balance out Rooney .
  - Lawls . Never thought he was all that attractive til today . That red jersey becomes him
- - OK ... Can you still spunk of you have had a Vasectomy 
  - Yes  but you only spunk semen with no sperm .

- - It s telling you only to eat the fortune cookie  not the little piece of paper inside of it .
  - exactly . do nt eat the fortune . eat the cookie though .

  - Well you know how it is with public transport ; you wait all day for one and then two show up together .
- - I do nt think there has been any scientific study on the existence of God .
  - That s because science makes no claims about the existence of god . It only deals with the natural world .
- - Sony and Marvel making a deal . If this happens  we could finally see Spider-Man joining the Avengers 
  - Yeah  but lets be honest . No one wants to see the new spiderman actor mixed in with the great cast in Avengers .
  - They said they may use a different actor . I agree  though . Andrew Garfield would nt feel like a fellow Avenger  he d feel like a kid .
  - That s kind of how spiderman is though . He s a smartass kid . You seen any of the animated stuff 
  - I m a huge fan of the comics . By kid  I mean he does nt have anything to bring .
  - Ah . I thought you meant mentally .
- - Lee probably would have treated Arvo better from the start  so the Russian shootout probably would not have happened .
  - He certainly would nt have stood for Kenny beating Arvo
- - By a forest pass  go hiking . Explore .
  - Where do you need a pass for the forest  . The idea makes me sad .

- - Oh wow  are you in the jury then  Because I m not .
  - you seem to be fine with being a judge  though
- - dunno  hav nt heard back from admins yet
  - I think it s pretty unlikely they will unban you  probably just easier to create a new account and start from scratch .
- - You re thinking too small . Pitch it to GameFreak .
  - Even better . Pitch to Nintendo as a Wii U exclusive
- - Shida did your experiment go wrong in the right ways  Also ... I can see nips  Or at least lines that imply them 
  - he s currently trying to find some clothes before trying to revert his form
- - Am I the only one annoyed by the poor placement of speech bubbles in the opening panel  They re backwards 
  - I was gon na complain about that if nobody else did .
  - It seems more like it was originally bubbled like a manga  but placed like a comic .
  - Or the creator used to make rage comics .
- - The property owner on the other side has been known to pull shotguns on people .
  - Lol I ve heard the same I would nt blame him with all the people trying to get there rocks off at the tunnel
- - Luol Deng would be perfect fit for the Grizzlies . Grit and grind player that plays hard every minute .
  - Yeah I want Deng much more than Green . It just seems like he would fit the culture better .
- - Would nt have been a big deal if he just kept walking .
  - I thought the same thing  if he had just casually walked through hardly anyone would have paid attention . Or cared .
- - Life hack . keep your lightbulbs in the box they were bought in .

- - Must be playing a fighter . I also had to switch to playing like that for Ys . Oath in Felghana .
  - Only way to play Tekken for me .
- - Please Panthers  I want to believe ...
  - Something we can definitely agree on . Ai nt nobody in the AFC who s gon na feel confident about taking home the Lombardi with the Seahawks defending it in Arizona .
- - That might not be the best of ideas ... Some of those can be quite sharp  you know . As an Assassin  I know this fact quite well .
  - This is true ... well I will see myself out then 
- - Get rid of Thad sure  but it d kill me inside to see Pek and Martin go .
  - Pek will never live up to that contract they need to find a way to get someone to take him
- - This album really grew on me over the course of the year . Bought a physical copy last week .
  - Agreed . Not album of the year material for me  but definitely ended up liking it the more I listened .
- - AZ on Lillian between Durham and Shepherd south of Washington .
  - I will definitely check them out  thanks 
- - Live fast  die young . A carbon tax makes sense but the ideology states all taxes are bad . So there .
  - But it s not a tax ... Bah . No point .
- - Well  open your windows  buy a fan . You ca nt do much
  - I take it putting an ice pack under it is a bad idea

  - I ve got it where it can ventilate  maybe ill try buying a fan or something

  - Yeah  I do nt remember any mention of a sister .
  - There was mention of a sister . I do nt remember a name .

- - There s a reason you have nt heard of these  but I bet you ve heard about The Dark Knight and the Godfather II
  - Eh  get outta here . Spoiled sport

  - If Luke dies the same way as Ben did in A New Hope ugh ... it s going to happen .

- - I got Wind Rak . Anyone know if she s worth investing in 
  - She is . Violent runes make her fun .
- - If the BTC were stolen  they re still part of the money supply  just a few laundry loads away from rejoining circulation
  - Money laundering is good news for Bitcoin 
- - I have nt been a fan of most horror movies in the past decade or more ... But Damn was that a good movie .
  - I would have to concur on that point . Best horror film in years .
- - HAHA nice  Do you have a photo of it after baking 
  - Unfortunately no . I was too hungry

  - It s ok  I ve got this one OP ... Yes  yes it is .

- - Find an answer yourself  do nt rely on others .
  - I know but I was kind of hoping someone who had found an answer themselves would be able to tell how they did that .
- - Thanks for the heads-up  I ll get to fixing this tomorrow . Pretty late right now .
  - it would literally take you ten seconds ...
- - Guess a not really out of control mini van wouldnt wreck the sand trap as much as a full semi would
  - I do nt imagine they got very far
- - Idk  did nt Tebow lose pretty badly to Alabama and cry over it 
  - Yea that s why it s a comeback story duh
- - Every citizen must unplug all electrical appliances before bed to prevent fire .
  - And by turning off our water heaters until we need them the country will save trillions of dollars every year .
- - The scene is nt dying  just changing .

- - Hold it  Im pretty sure that if you visit then on the day their moving  when all their stuff is packed  you can tell that villager to stay
