  - Jolders is awesome in general  but in VoG  CM outclasses it .
- - my view is that this is a part time gig  which is only good if you re using it to pay bills while you pursue a credential or higher education .
  - Except the only bill you can pay is your car note . That s the reality for many . And no  it s not their fault .
  - It is absolutely their fault . No one is forcing them to drive for Uber or Lyft . No one is stopping them from finding a better paying job .
  - Uber is nt a job you simpleton fool . It s a business .
- - But do you use magic missile to attack the darkness 
  - Only after I put on my robe and wizard hat .

- - Love that game but that campaign is absolute fucking bullshit .
  - Yup  it s really dificult  that s why I m scared to play extra missions . D .
- - The unicorn label  Good luck . Our city has some ridiculously stupid attorneys .
  - The fact that they started the process of licensing it in the first place wo nt help Pabst s case . They obviously recognized it was similar enough .
- - I might just talk you up on that  I got a few lesson from someone on duel but more practice ca nt hurt 
  - i m on right now if you d like to play . add me and send me a message

- - Your grandfather has a hint of Benedict Cumberbatch in him .
  - See  we were thinking Hugo Weaving . But I see your point .

  - Confirmed Jagex is ddosing their own servers to get the players to pay more .
- - You re either retarded or a troll . Inbred dogs and inbred humans are entirely different .
  - maybe your dating an inbred dog  i dont know you that well
- - Currently have some VapeWild flavors in Max VG and they are quite good . For the price  I would recommend them for sure .
  - Which flavors did you order  I put in an order with them and it should be here tuesday . Trying something new and I hope its good 
- - Nope  they both have to be used together the first time they re ever used  and never with anything else from then on .
  - This . Since you ve used them separately  there is a chance that they will be somewhat slightly out of balance .
- - funny how I was just about to say that Benfica is hated by everyone who is nt a Benfica supporter
  - I was going to say the same thing . Benfica is definitely the most hated club in Portugal . It s also the most loved though .

  - Me  too  Just about there .
- - Is nt he being completely frozen out  Or am I thinking of someone else at barca

- - Nah  all you need is the CE raid cloak  and the sunsetting eris shader
  - I really like it with Broadsword and Revenant myself . How does it look with sunsetting

  - Its also funny you say this because you ve participated in these attacks too . So please stop being a hypocrite .
- - Where in the hell is the child in this story  Come on . It s only about authority . Do nt ruin her life for being human .
  - No children involved here  I just do nt like stupid people teaching .
- - I personally find being a Muslim in a conservative state a lot easier than a liberal state but maybe that s just me .
  - It s not you . It was a flippant comment and the OP should nt have made it .
- - that is heartbreaking  I really hope the girl is doing better . Makes you not want to bring daughters into the world  the things some people do .
  - Thanks . It took a while  but she s much better now and has a family to another guy . I m happy she found peace at last .
- - Call him a piece of shit  Seriously just tell him what he is doing is considered lame and maybe he ll stop 
  - Someone said I should talk to him . I do nt like to be rude so if he does nt listen then I ll just leave him to himself
- - It s possible to download apps to detect when these devices are tracking your phone . I do nt know if iPhone users can  but Android users definitely can .
  - Got a source for that  I d love to increase security on my phone .
- - Good point  wo nt add that in the description ...

- - They said soon as in end of November soon back around mid-november . Fuck Lenovo .
  - For the second gen  not the first .
- - Excuse me for my perverted mind  but the colored version of that tongue looks a bit phallic  especially at the tip .
  - Yeah I noticed that too ... I guess we should grow up
- - Hm  I ve seen dozens of commanders in Ho Hsi so far .
  - It s possible just a timezone issue  but I still do nt trust their network .
- - tell him to decline truck simulator and you get it back
  - Thanks  i didnt really knew what happens when i gift somebody something so i was pretty scared
- - How do you get up from a seated position  Does it make a difference 
  - I just stand up slowly so I do nt get too dizzy .
- - Remember he s coming from northern England .
  - Ya so he d probably melt and die in Houston
- - I d get someone other than Benny and Bjorn from ABBA to write the music  for starters .
  - I d be going for plot modifications more than musical modifications . Give Svetlana a bit more to do and for the love of god stop changing the ending between productions .
- - This has been done in many countries and works extremely well .
  - Needs an underpass too  some animals do nt like going up it .
- - If you watch Scarface you got to have the Coca laid out on the table
  - Reenact that epic face plant eh  I m pretty sure he snorted my salary in that scene .
- - Why announce this now  For Henderson to take the armband  To get out of the way and officially take a bench role 
  - Total speculation  but I bet MLS tickets go on sale soon .
- - Any episode with The Question is my favorite .
  - Question  Vigilante  and Captain Atom . All of them were great .
- - Damn  I need to work through that . One thing from skimming it . Average numbers seem to be more realistic .
  - Average sucks at showing bad repartition of wealth .
- - Personally  I think it looked much better with the stock front bumper .
  - It was going so well until they pulled out that bumper . looks like something you would find unpainted falling off a civic
- - Wait  am I not understanding the analogy  How can toy trains be used to kill people 
  - You could use it to pull the trigger of a gun .

  - No no no  there are feelings being hurt  No time to actually do something useful .
- - So ... how do the English guys feud with the Japanese guys  Is there a translator 
  - NJPW feuds are very simple A has a belt  B wants it A is a dick so he slaps B or squares up to him A betrays and attacks B
- - we ca nt do anything against howard in the paint
  - should be better once Mozgov is in .
- - But why do guys bother giving pseudo compliments 
  - They probably do nt realize they re giving pseudo compliments instead of real compliments
- - People do get regular x-rays and body scans  but they re not absolutely necessary because most people are healthy .
  - Really  I ve never heard of anyone having one when they do nt have a specific problem being looked for . Interesting .
- - I have doubt s in the inflationary effects of tax independent government spending .
  - Indeed  taxation is pretty common to achieve a balanced state budget .
- - Destroy the lives of all the people who fucked me over
  - Well ... that s funny but how bad did they screw you over 
- - What decks do you play generally speaking 
  - I can play pretty much any deck except for Rogue and Warrior since I do nt have Preparations and I do nt have a good warrior deck except for Math Warrior .
- - This is great  So three dimensional ... Now I want to practice drawing dragons 
  - Thanks  Woo go and draw me an awesome dragon  I want to see it if you draw it C .

  - alcohol and benzo withdrawals can both cause heart attacks or seizures . So yes . But ca nt stay that way forever .

  - I d rather have a sitcom than the Knicks
- - The battles are  but I thought if you play the campaign the galactic map is more turn-based .
  - Yeah  the Galactic Campaign is turn based with real time Space Battles .
- - No doubt I ll get down voted but I love Scream . It still remains along with Get Shorty as my favorite screenplays .
  - Not a bad answer at all . It turned the horror genre inside out  and is still really friggin scary .
- - Wow  that s pretty abysmal . I had no idea prices on EU were so different .
  - Yeah  but thankfully in turn I think the gear prices are a bit lower too  so at least we have that going for us 
- - I hear you . I go through the same thing at work .
  - Its getting a lil bit better tho . You ca nt let it break you  be stronger  thats the key .
- - It may be NFL then  I m sure one American sport has a salary cap
  - The NFL  NBA  NHL do I believe .

- - Well  my penis is scared  and I saw A Serbian Film .
  - I own Serbian Film . Great icebreaker to show females  highly recommend it .
- - What about having her volunteer in your local community  Poverty exists in more places besides abroad .
  - You re absolutely right . However  I think that part of the learning experience will be to find herself completely out of her comfort zone and away from everything familiar .
- - I ca nt even log on  I m hoping it s down and has nothing to do with my connection
  - So i m not the only one worrying about connection problems hehe . I m sure Riot will post something on their website soon
- - It s disturbing that a company can even amass so many patents without even producing the tech for the public . What a stupid system .
  - Yeah  protecting your shareholder s investment is so stupid . Amirite 
- - Hey  how does one play these lists in mobile 
  - I m not entirely sure  but if you click on one it should open in the App .
- - Any news on where a Canadian can watch this legally since Crunchyroll does nt have it in my region  
  - Preventing us from watching the anime of the century .
- - As of that comment  they exist . I m calling a RetJohn there .
  - My account may be new  but my burning hatred for all things Gamzee knows no beginning and no end .
- - You can be guilty of something that isnt illegal . for example  im guilty of eating all the cookies in the cookie jar .
  - I understand your argument  but disagree . The word guilty  at least in my ear  is indicative of some sort of wrongdoing .
- - To measure myself for a properly fitting bra . I busted out the tape measure and did it myself  and the girls have never looked better .
  - Ok teach me because it s always been a problem for me 
- - Laughing at you all the way from California .
  - That s my dream . My absolute dream .
- - connection not going so good  will make sure missus is not downloading crap
  - It s cool man . No worries .
- - What about if it is hammer time  Can you DM during hammer time  I feel like it would be a conflict of interests .
  - only if you have proficiency in parachute pants
- - IDK what it is for but you should be able to use it as a usb port
  - I am not going to put a usb device in it  that does nt fit . p
- - I do nt know whether the rules would allow it  but it could be an interesting way to control the airflow
  - I think it would create more drag than beneficial airflow . Otherwise  teams already would ve done this .
- - So what do you recommend getting here  Is there anything spectacular I should try 
  - I dunno . I ve only eaten here like  two times .
- - All that hard work . You have earned yourself a new set of rims .
  - Just want you to know I had a good laugh . Do nt let those down votes discourage you 
- - mostly scripted . Zach is gifted at uncomfortable humor .
  - So in all the episodes  the guests actually feel very uncomfortable 
- - Can you record a voice recording for my voicemail 
  - If you re willing to pay my rates . . D
- - I m in Cincinnati and fish the Little Miami if you are ever down this way .

  - You combined it with heavy drinking then i take it 
- - That cock and balls could ve been drawn by anyone .
  - What do you know about dick and balls 
- - Unrelated to the discussion  but I thought retail pharmacists are nt accountable to the local management . Just corporate .
  - Depends on the pharmacy . My friend is a pharmacist at Walgreen s and recently started reporting to the store manager . She s pissed about it .
  - I can imagine . They already put in silly hours at Walgreen s to begin with
  - Her schedule is pretty sweet actually . They tend to give shorter and consistent shifts as compared to other pharmacies .
- - Bourbon  whiskey  or scotch . On the rocks is acceptable .
  - Basically  thats our catch all . When in doubt . scotch neat
- - With no purpose  willingness to defend it logically  or self examination what is the point of voicing it 
  - To hear about different opinions and see exactly where they separate from my own .
- - You know  there are so many famous Churchill quotes  I m starting to wonder if he could actually speak any other way .
  - Churchill is obviously a professional quote maker .
- - well besides leaving it so the sequel cant be made quite a few .
  - I forgot that they fucked the end up that bad .
- - I need Sitton in my life . Elite LG with GP style
  - How much is he running for on AH 
- - Asking for a mulligan after Survivor Series is basically the best most incredibly hilarious thing a heel could do .
  - Haha  Dude  I know . I loved that .
- - Not that I disagree with you  but damn what a shitty title to have .
  - Haha I guess it s sort of a backhanded compliment
- - I paired Lewandowski with if drmic and drmic scores more goals  i try to afford Mller so i can Put them both up top . Drmic plays pretty much like Benzema
  - Thinking of SIF LF Perisic as a ST also
- - how great it would be Del Rio attacking Angle outta nowhere 
  - You owe me new roof slates  my boner just went straight through the roof
- - I guess because it s about learning to place the crosshair on the head . Might make your spray control suck though - probably will have to work on that after
  - Doesnt affect spray . Just makes accurate . Spray remains . Try command . It makes accurate while moving .
- - TOTW Thornton  put a C on him for extra speed and then he becomes a tank .
  - I m getting him when I m done grinding out Pittsburgh and can blow my coin without guilt .
- - You re the type of person that makes me happy to be a PC Gamer  and part of this community . Enjoy the gold .
  - Holy crap  thank you  I just wanted to make someone s day a little brighter .
- - Kos and Mert were shit  Szcz needs to be dropped for whichever keeper we have that s still alive . Claude and Ty should be on form tonight .
  - Szcz had a bad game . I ca nt help but think even Martinez would have done better
- - Saw some of these at a books a million store closing for half price . Should have bought them all
  - I m actually completely happy with this purchase . Usually this sort of stuff disappoints me .
- - I second Godspeed You  Black Emporer - great band 
  - Yeah I finally listened to Lift Yr Skinny Fists in one sitting for the first time . I ve always liked it but it makes it a lot better all together .
- - Nu vet jag inte riktigt om du tror att jag r frn USA ...
  - Nei  det var ikke du som var ment .
- - Obviously trolling ... and a little bit hoping . Microsoft has got to do domething with it ...
  - How would a sequel even work  Maybe a different theme or setting with the same mechanics of resource collecting and exploration . Like MC in space or something .
- - Does your monitor have input select  If it does  make sure it s set to HDMI and not another type .
  - thats not the problem its that i dont get a signal until bios is finished
- - You also ca nt spell J. R. Smith without smh . DAE Smiths suck confirmed 
  - can confirm  had Nolan Smith as a major rotation piece for a season .
- - Is there any way to get Crota Exp besides Eris Bounties 
  - Nope . I think that s the worst thing about this DLC . They purposely made it hard .
  - Not hard  grindy . There is a major difference .
  - It s hard when you get no new challenges . It happens to me and my friends all the time .
- - I m from Canada . What s the problem 
  - Where exactly and do you own anything valuable 
- - Are rangers really doing well in PvP  I may give Ranger a shot in PvP to see if I like the playstyle  otherwise I think I ll be going Mesmer
  - survival ranger is currently more viable than mesmer  but that will probably change as soon as cele is nerfed . mesmer is really fun too .
- - that you said could of  instead of could have 
  - Where s Captain Hindsight when you need him .
- - Smart enough to write a beautiful application ...  That s not smart  So what have you done  then 
  - Oh lol . This is the Rsync guy . Nvm .
- - I like the fact that the Hunter s legendary is a dead cow .
  - Also hunter was left for the last part
- - Fear not . Hitchens and Chomsky inspired you and certainly inspired many others too . There will be other great voices of reason to follow in their footsteps .
  - And when there was only one set of footsteps in the sand  it s because I chose to follow the path of those who inspired me .
- - Great call . I plan to do this with my lil girl as well . And get a tattoo .
  - Yeah I m thinking about a tattoo as well  not sure where to put it though
- - Can u tell me how to clone apps using ifile or any other method 
  - Sorry  I do nt know how to clone apps using any other method . I just use Slices  it s much easier and less time consuming .
- - The scale of this picture could be anywhere between a few feet and a hundred miles .
  - Yeah  I need a banana for scale .
- - So what . tons of people would have died from all sorts of other things as well . dieing is nt that big of deal .
  - Dying from something preventable is a big deal to the people who have to pay the funeral home to dispose a pickled corpse .
- - How exactly do you know they are lying 
  - Because you find out by other means  other online info basically .
- - IF they got Fitzgerald  I imagine Jennings would be gone .
  - I do nt think so . We need more weapons for Teddy  not the same amount with a different name .
- - I do nt believe so  why 
  - Shooting was a graded school subject in elementary school .
- - Assuming I do nt get to pick the type of violence or disease I d say violence . You die faster in most situations
  - On the other hand it could be slow torture ...
- - Gon na need some cream for that burn .
  - Was that Eidolon of the Great Revel out against a Storm deck  Cause that was a sick nasty burn .
- - It looks like Robocop fucked the monster from Aliens and then birthed the child in a Tron movie .
  - That sounds much cooler than this monstrosity .
- - Probably the only way they can hit their target audience . They are nothing like advertising food on Food network .
  - Target audience for a gas and electric utility is everyone . Target audience for a defense contractor is the military .
- - why the hell isnt that just default 
  - It s a hell of a lot of text after a while .
- - Ha  Plot twist  Nice  What s his name really  Tyler or Xavier 
  - Oh crap haha I ve got to edit that bit out . Xavier is his real name .

  - he said it on twitter a couple months back
- - I heard Jeff Jarrett s TNA theme and felt physically ill .
  - I marked out when it hit . Maybe I m a bad person .
- - Did nt think I d like this . But I m genuinely loving it .
  - Thank you  I m glad you like it 
- - Haha oh man that s actually a pretty clever idea Ladies . what is Winrar  You . it allows me to unzip certain things . Want me to show you 
  - This needs to happen cause I would definitely buy one .
- - What is it with Scarlett Johannson and sci-fi  Under the skin  Lucy and now this . It ll probably suck  but who knows .
  - Surprisingly  she has a history with sci-fi . The Island and Her as well .
- - Looks great . Ca nt get enough of the blue face on this one .
  - My only complaint is that it does nt work for too long after removing it . Always seems to die overnight . Hopefully yours is different
- - Exactly what is it you feel you are missing with a mirrorless that you hope to get with a DSLR 
  - See the new text under my edit  could you please again reply 
- - It s not called a fucking skit man . He is doing stand up comedy .
  - Skit . a satirical or humorous story or sketch .
- - I m not really sure what I m looking at . Whats uncomfortable 
  - If you look at the tops of the gunner s and loader s heads  they are poking out of the turret .

  - Uhhh I was at the rose bowl . When did that happen 
- - No asking for karma please . I m deleting this .
  - Sorry  I was not meaning to ask for karma . Guess it kinda came out like that though .
- - Cambridge  away game . Would have been cool if they had came to Old Trafford  but a fun draw .
  - If it s dry  go punting on the river down the backs . Try it yourself . Really cool experience .
- - i think its confusing that the same letter means both d and s
  - Doubled . It should maybe have some same shapes  but exact same letter  No way ... maybe at least flip the D horizontally 
- - Also  why is there a massive gap to the east 
  - For when the claims on this new continent is filled  I can make another one in the east .
- - Admittedly I m not a lawyer but would nt he d be booked for murder in America  Is nt that pretty much the same as hiring a contract killer 
  - Does it matter  He s not in America .
- - Haha George and Greg are singing . So good to hear . I m really happy for our announcers . They deserve this 
  - Yea they do  All those ugly  sad games they had to cover . Now this outta the blue  great stuff 
- - This is nt montage  this is more like joke video .
  - You Viewed it . im happy . D
- - Should we lump Wales in with the UK though  Cause if so ... Lifetime ban from righteousness
  - Well you put England in separately in your post so I thought I d sneakily put Wales in separately too .
- - So this is what I get for figuring out the challenge
  - Did you read that wrong  It says you re safe .
  - But it means someone wants me out . Unless chris just wanted me to be second last
  - He just puts someone random there if nobody voted for anyone else .
- - I ve seen the term AU all over the place  and I m sure I m missing something obvious  but what does AU mean 
  - Pretty sure it means alternate universe . Or otherwise  not canon .
- - Damn thats true  it has been a while since I ve read it . The second half of DW was fantastic  I think its time for a re-read
  - Beware of huge feels man . I do nt know wtf I m going to do  I m sort of depressed now .
- - Saw nissan skyline  rest of the story does nt matter haha
  - Yeah  I think that amazed me most too .
- - Wow  this is pretty neat looking . I wonder why they cut Spain out of Europe though
  - And the British isles  Taiwan  and Portugal
- - If you did nt get a look at them  how do you know they are from Berkeley High School 
  - Best guess based on their behavior  their sizes and the kinds of people who hang around in big groups in downtown Berkeley when the high school is out for lunch .
- - How do people like this get elected  the electorate that puts someone like this in office is a terrifying group of people 
  - Someone put his name on a list  thats how he got elected . People vote for AKP not individuals .
- - I did nt see the OP implying that they intend to only learn from anime and nothing else . As one source among many  anime is perfectly fine .
  - Fair enough . I was merely providing words of caution . It is a great ambition one has when one decides to learn a new language .
- - The Refs ruined a great game . Good luck  Dallas . Take out discount doublecheck .
  - Hey man good on you for being better than most of your counterparts and being graceful in defeat .
- - Weird  but he is a great example of that
  - You can add a picture of Hitler to almost any motivational quote and it fits pretty well .
- - The rumors of him leaving Liverpool as well as joining MLS came at the same time .
  - Thats because the timing . Since the MLS season starts in the earlier part of the year  the team will want to start marketing the move and sell tickets .
- - Go Hawks  Ca nt wait for the game this weekend . Scored some sweet seats .
  - Woo  Alas  I will be watching them tear Carolina a new one from home . Enjoy the game .
- - It could be a number of issues . But my first guess would be that the system is overheating . Does it run very loud or is the case abnormally warm 
  - It is very loud  what should I do 
- - Gem Emerald . I believe it is based on lollipops design .
  - Gem Emerald is great  and it s free on XDA .
- - I m sorry but your TLDR made me laugh so fucking hard
  - Would make a great opening statement in a lonely hearts ad 
- - Okay  is there anything there or is it shopped 
  - Are you kidding  There s clearly an aircraft there . You really need to get your eyes checked .
- - Read the wiki page I posted  dumbass .
  - I did dumbass  did you read it . Dude did nt even graduate from UNL  that tells you all you need to know .
- - I ve never seen those at a gas station . My gas stations must suck 
  - Ours are often purchased by supermarkets  and this one is a classy shop  so they stock wines and duck dinners ...
- - You wo nt win many games passing for that few of yards
  - Who says every game plan is the same  Zaire can sling it too .
- - You could do the same thing in America . You know  and then be imprisoned for stolen valor and such .
  - Ever thought about that this is not what I meant  Of course it was about what happened even if you were authorised to wear that uniform
- - Gerry Armstrong is the most biased commentator I have heard . Ray Hudson is fun to listen to  but he does nt really know what he is talking about .
  - When he controls himself  Hudson is pretty good . I see why some people make not like him  but he s not that bad
- - The lighter the roast the more caffeine it contains .
  - That was what I thought as well . This chart claims otherwise .
- - Happy birthday  the cake looks awesome and delicious 
  - It really was haha thank you . D
- - Assuming we keep Harvin  and Amaro progresses reasonably  we are all set on pass catchers . We have much  much bigger needs than WRs .
  - Not to mention Evans could be a steal 
- - Awww he looks very happy maybe zoos back then were more respectable places ... But I could be way off .
  - I am pretty sure zoos back then were much worse for the animals than today .
- - Oh my  A SUPER MIRACLE  That s even better than a miracle 
  - It was a sub miracle that I found my car keys .
- - lol . Do you know which episode that is 
  - It s the very first episode near the beginning of the show .
- - Are they so used to bigger girls in the UK that they ca nt see how a thin girl is anymore  
  - That  along with an overbearing public need for sterile interactions  has brought us to the point where fitness is obscene .
- - ITT . People who have never heard about pizza with no cheese .
  - MmM round here we call it tomato pie
- - I m fine with how it all turned out .

  - I ve never had any real problems either .
- - I second that as a former competitive yugioh player . Duels of the Planeswalker made it very easy for me to transition and understand that MTG is a better game .
  - What is competitive yugioh like  compared to competitive magic 
- - Easily verifiable  so it was easy for him to search for it to prove it . If people make a claim  I expect them to back it up .

- - what goes first  flashing motherboard s bios to recent firmware or installing os  building a new pc

- - Nice footage man  Is that a helmet or a chest mount .
  - Helmet . Got the mount glued to the front directly above my goggles .
- - My setup was similar until I recently changed it . I hate pulling aggro off of tanks it drives me batshit insane .
  - That is the tanks fault . D You should be aiming for max DPS  the tank should aim for keeping aggro against you .
- - Good  no need to re-enact Tyler Durden .

- - wow  such loss for me  much not awesome . thanks for the info tho
  - God  I hope for your sake they are going to use you as an example of a winner .
- - Leave this world with more than you take out .
  - Meant when you leave this world make sure you gave more then you took out
- - This is the best on this sub this year . Not some stupid pun or joke . An uninteresting story I enjoyed reading .
  - I like it because it builds up so much  and then it ends up being not interesting . Well done  OP .
- - A great number of people do recommend it as it allows you to buffer tilts while perfect pivoting .
  - And it takes away your ability to smash while perfect pivoting .
- - Also this one . Cant remember  i thought he didnt lost his sight on brotherhood .
  - He gets it back at the end  using a Stone to heal his eyes  but he definitely loses his sight for a while .

  - That far   You mean you did nt even make it through the whole thing  
- - bro you fucked his ex you have no right to try to fix the situation . If you fuck my ex I would want nothing to do with you either .
  - Why you have no claim over your ex 
  - If a chick hurt me emotionally like all exs do as my bro you should hate that bitch too .
  - Also you can hate someone and still have sex with them
- - its an mkv problem not a plex problem .
  - Yes it is a MKV problem  however it causes issues with Plex itself because of it .
  - Was it transcoding at that time or does your client support mkv directly 
  - Transcoding . Even using Direct Play in PHT caused issues .
- - This bench ball movement is looking great .
  - It s insane . After so many years of Joe Johnson and josh smith isos  this ball movement gives me tears of joy
- - Excuse my ignorance but what is the purpose of the block 
  - Just to have a set distance between the handles .
- - Good  glad to see . Hopefully we can get something passed soon to allow school children to arm themselves  so we can finally see an end to school shootings .
  - haha ... that s a bit of a leap from what their trying to do . Nice tactic though
- - Could be many things . Got a pic 
  - ca nt get a pic . it goes away to fast
- - What you re looking for is called a HDMI distribution amplifier . Or HDMI DA for short .
  - Those look a lot more professional than a simple splitter . What s the difference

  - Kinda like the interpretation Islamic terrorists make 
- - what does it look like without the oil and water 
  - if only there were some kind of search tool you could use to answer that .

  - This has been know since shortly after Christmas .
- - I think he did a Joint Operations Centre Mix for trance producer trolls last year I m sure .
  - Yeah he did  but a live set would be massive

  - This is me . It took a loooong time to come to terms with it though .
