  - dude you got me exactly and i may have the hardest part ever dished out .

- - It s like they have the same source material or something 
  - I know it s from the comics i m just saying that they used the characters with almost the same source for they powers
- - Weed can bring out schizophrenia ca nt it 
  - It definately can . But at the very least it feeds into paranoia .

  - Yeah  as debates usually are . But since it s starting to strain things  I d rather be happy than right .
- - This is Amazing . One of the best here 
  - Thanks  It s one part my story  one part my nightmare .
- - Would getting a nanny help her feel more comfortable  That might be a compromise worth looking into ... on top of some of the other suggestions already made .

- - Do nt need to watch Birdemic after this .
  - This actually made me WANT to see it
- - Yeah I like to think this is the case rather than Luke just magically becoming powerful enough to beat Vader in such a short space of time .
  - Although  Lucas has stated that Luke was to become the most powerful Jedi ever  and no writer in anything Star Wars is allowed to say otherwise .
- - Seriously . Plus I m sure it was Del Rio who brought in Pot Roast and Brandon Marshal .
  - Elway brought in Marshall after Jacksonville kept cutting him over and over again .
