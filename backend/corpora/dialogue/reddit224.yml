- - What if they realized they made a horrible mistake and wanted to spend the rest of their life making it up to you 
  - If you could nt spend the rest of your life making me happy when we got married  why would I trust you could do it now 
- - Why would nt the Fire Chief have something to say about a venue being overcrowded 
  - I am guessing the official capacity it can safely hold based on safety is more than a stadium has seats .

- - pretty sure the lil b beef was a setup at least I saw an interview where joey said it was
  - It could be  but either way it does nt make him look too great
- - That is exactly the point that I was trying to make . Injuries happen and they suck for both teams . I was disagreeing with what the previous poster was saying .
  - Yeah I got it  just elaborating .
- - Cool . Thanks for the advice . Will re-evaluate and try again .

- - Gaben forgot to pay his electricity bill again .
  - Impossible . He creates electricity from his finger tips .
- - Wildturtle has looked objectively far worse than doublelift . In terms of individual skill double and sneaky are tied for one .
  - The Wildturtle situation can be debated  but you putting Doublelift over Piglet in terms of who s closest to Sneaky skill-wise makes me question your judgement
- - Drop my tablet  grab my gun  and be thankful I live in Texas .
  - Amateur . I grab my recurve bow and and an arrow

- - Benny is strong . You guys know what I mean ...
  - If you mean what I think you mean ...
- - The Dark Side of The Moon album by Pink Floyd
  - Indeed  but it takes some commitment  because when you start that album you have to hear it the whole way through
- - Weed is the answer to everything the problem is they have nt found a way to Monopolize it and thats the only reason its not totally legal
  - Shitty advice . Weed keeps you in whatever rut you are in .

  - I need to figure out the costs of that  then .
- - I was going to try  but I see winner has been picked .
  - Feel free to attempt  if your drawing is of good quality  Ill probably gild you multiple times

  - Because it s the Feud man  and he s actually pretty funny most of the time .
- - You probably want to reach out to them to see how the process is progressing .
  - Unfortunately I have emailed them and they have nt responded . Should I be calling them as well 
- - This does nt have anything to do with atheism .
  - How does it suit your ego knowing you re off base 
- - Yeah  as if they have a choice to believe otherwise . They believe what they are told . Do nt you know that 
  - Everything is controlled in North Korea so they do nt have a choice at all . All media is controlled by a contrived government led by a crazy dictator .
- - Good God I m going to miss this man when I m sitting down tonight to listen to Cole talk about the WWE Network .
  - Maybe someone should dub over episodes of Raw with attitude era commentary  and just replace the names of old wrestlers with the new ones .
- - Can I still create a poll once in a while though
  - Yes  just as long it is nt in a series .
- - Id be there for sure  Someone told me it was at VIR this year since there were too many people for summit point
  - I m out of the loop  Everybody to VIR 
- - Most people prefer drinking over pot . In my opinion it tastes better  makes people more sociable  and does nt leave you smelling strange after consumption .
  - If nobody tells you that you smell like drinking  that does nt mean you do nt smell like drinking .
- - Been feeling off since last night and now listening to loud music in bed . Even rejected the offer of eating pizza earlier .
  - even pizza  woah dude that does nt sound good  need to talk to someone  ill be here for an hour .

  - my So is my best friend so I have him by my side . goodnight man  anytime .
- - No reciept means no dice  It s your proof of purchase and your responsibility to keep it safe 
  - Darn titty sprinkles . Maybe when I input the Forza code into PSN it will magically turn into The Last of Us

  - Did you look at the pictures  They gave an additional cosmetic effect whenever spidey does some moves when using the Superior Spider-man costume .

  - not yet  but i will as soon as i can
- - You should nt be going to Vegas and staying with a woman while you have a gf ... past bj or not
  - I just started dating her  the trip was planned beforehand -- plane tickets bought  hotel booked  etc .
- - You want a recipe to recreate it  Open up your DAW  start experimenting with your keyboard .
  - I mean I got the other instruments but the notes on the piano part just do nt sound right when I play them
- - She COULD be the one    
  - Go on  Now  Throw her in the fire 
- - that s what gets me  it takes ten seconds to wash it in the shower  its just part of the routine
  - I know right  It s not like its a tedious task . It s as if everyone shaved off head hair because then you would nt have too wash it .
- - At the same time it will probably be more difficult to find a job in the countryside .
  - If I was fleeing death I reckon a job would be low on my list of requirements .
- - methinks you were watching the flintstones movie for the wrong reasons .
  - Indeed  it was all about Halle Berry .
- - When did they say they were changing it  All i read was the were updating it visually and it would have better performance then the current one .
  - Hmm  I was under the assumption that there was going to be more than a visual update . I m probably wrong tho
- - Love the tat . Any better pics of it

- - What year were you listening to it  Male or female singer  Anything you can remember about the lyrics 
  - Male lead singer . I ca nt really remember the year BUT it was on cassette if that helps . Description has been updated since that s pretty vital information .

  - generally no . I m straight and theres places I wouldnt hike around though .
- - Rotate your CPU heatsink to exhaust out the back . Preferably with the fan in pull config . Then it would be perfect .

  - Unfortunately  I ca nt find them . I suppose I could always make another post about it .

  - Yep  that happened to be the first time I ever seen them synced up . I ve gotten better at waiting and getting the timing right though .
- - I ve zoned out a few times with no recollection of what I was thinking at the time .
  - I do this every time I drive 
- - Would be nice if there was an actual demo 
  - It s in the codepen example at the bottom but you have to scroll down within the codepen box to trigger the modal . Was thinking the same thing .
- - It s a parody of the real-life practice by Albert Einstein and Steve Jobs .
  - Same reason why Mark Zuckerberg says he only wears a grey T-shirt .
- - Even Ditka is tearing up . Fuck cancer .
  - Ditka is a hard man . A man hard enough to cry when it hurts  knowing that crying is the best way to show strength .
- - Would you happen to know of a more idiomatic translation
