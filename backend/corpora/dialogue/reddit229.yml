  - First thing I noticed was that half-eaten turkey leg hoisted in the air like an Olympic torch .

  - It slid off the road into a house .
- - Yeah . That s a little different then what we are talking about .
  - Hey  I m just saying  people hear about this case and THINK it means they re entitled to things .

  - I did nt comment on any of those threads . I just stay away from them . I do think she needs to step her game up .
- - What school do you go to that going out is secondary  That is definitely NOT the case at my school .
  - Oregon state  maybe it s just cause I do nt prioritize it but i guess I should say that school almost always comes first
- - As a Colts fan  go Cowboys because fuck Jim Caldwell
  - As a Colts fan I disagree . I like him as someone else s coach .
- - I just wanted to see the douchebag in the stripped shirt get fucked up and arrested . Disappointed .

  - And a blue house  with a blue little window . And a blue corvette ...

- - Are u the guy with the fucked-up mobile photos about RotMG  xD .
  - Photos  No . Just some crap videos
- - Probably I m too busy grooming my neckbeard to worry about such trivial matters as spelling
  - One does not groom a neckbeard . You imply that a mere human can contain their unbridled fury .

  - I hope you do nt mind if I start using it becuase I m going to .

  - I have no idea how they did nt see that .
- - Fuck I do nt get this shit like are you just insecure about your gender like wtf  Serious

  - Funeral by far  I would nt have to witness it
- - Fuck it . I ll do it live .

  - Obviously I meant I did nt leave it intentionally .

  - Yeah  no run game means you re forcing the QB to win the game for your team  and that just does nt work in this case .
- - that stop was more graceful than any stop i ve ever made
  - i read this then watched it thinking he would pull it off  wasnt sure how  now i understand
- - why the fuck is my ex-wife in my house ...
  - This made me laugh and feel good . Thank you .
- - Why were you traveling solo  How did you plan to raid an entire village by yourself 
  - This is extremely endgame  I had the best armor and weapons  insane extremely high stats . I could almost take a castle on my own
- - Your tax rate will jump  so make sure enough is taken out or you will be hit with a big surprise in April .

  - The only woman I recall seeing drive a stick is my sister . Does that count

- - Umm . Is nt this basically Lubuntu with the ugly default LXDE GUI 
  - No  there is more installed on Lubuntu than what gets installed in this blog post .
