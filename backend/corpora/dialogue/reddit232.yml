- - Is it just me or ISIS is like an equivalent of an old tribe that had insane beliefs and just followed them until they all died xD
  - This has nothing to do with ISIS .
- - Bin Laden and his family are insanely wealthy
  - I suppose if one terrorist is wealthy  most cant be poor .
- - And look  it did nt matter anyway . Never root for your team to lose .
  - I agree . I also wanted Leslie gone . But  regardless  I felt dirty and should nt have .

  - You mean you ca nt throw the ball back into the field to stop yourself from going out of bounds

  - That definitely might be an option but I d like to seal it with bees wax when I can

- - That is insane  I ve never heard that story before
  - I believe the FBI report said something like . If the coolant system had nt given out  he could have kept going for hours more ...

  - Absolutely . She has a close relationship with her family  which is what I assume happens when you re wrestling them for five or six years as a teenager .
- - Okay well then I m completely wrong in that respect . The point remains  though . The idea has been done over and over .
  - I long ago gave up on finding much of anything that is original in art . It does nt really even bother me any more .
- - no one should enjoy supporting their national team . it should be a painful ordeal that you must suffer through like extended families at christmas .

  - I see . I am not sure how they are exactly  but you could probably email them and ask for a picture .
- - Atl intro  What does this have Migos soundtrack or something
  - Yeah I was expecting Outkast  or Lil Jon as the announcer .
- - You obviously do nt listen to rap if you do nt think people heard monster or any of mix tape nicki . Your argument is irrelevant
  - Mix Tape Nicki is not world-famous rapper Nicki . I do nt understand why people like that version of her . It s not good .
- - That has everything to do with copyright law .
  - This is nt court . We are nt lawyers . This is nt a matter of litigation . It s how we perceive the morality of what was done .
- - I cant see it clearly but are you carrying the barbell or do you rest it on your body 
  - My intention is to rest on on my body but I think flexibility issues prevent that
- - The wolfshark is a great board  plenty of concave and its a real rigid deck for downhill .
  - Is it good for sliding and free ride  That s what I ll most likely be buying it for . Thanks
  - Yeah it s great  That s what I use it for .
  - Thanks I m looking at this and some nelson boards
- - Send me a PM . I ll give you info you might need .
  - PM sent . Thanks for the reply .

  - Feel free  and post pics when it s done . D
- - Hahahahahahaha hahahahah  Ha . Fuck the Bengals . Fuck the Steelers . We ll have to wait til next week til the Ravens get fucked .
  - Goddamn I ca nt wait to see them get sexually assaulted on National TV

  - I have been told that I could make a good disparity of force argument if I ever found myself in such a situation .
- - No I do nt have tattoos . Would you put a bumper sticker on a Mercedes 
  - I would nt put one on any car
- - He s a bit part cunt . Awful awful to work with
  - Probably why he had his visa revoked .

  - I m not a fan of Nicki either . My ENTP friend made me listen to it . Pointless lyrics  but catchy music .
- - You should nt use that PSU at all . Thermaltake is a shitty brand . Get EVGA  SeaSonic  or Corsair .

- - Could not stop thinking she was Sweet Dee .
  - It would be hard to get a bus up in a tree .

  - . P Doubly so for the drinking  but you know how us Ricans are with booze .
  - Ah yes  alcoholic dragon breath  and having to avoid open flames  LOL .
  - Breath of evil s bane at that . . p
- - I think most people cut it out and do a patch job on it .
  - That s my backup because I have no way to weld  but I guess I could shell out some extra money to get it done
  - doesnt the quarter panel not come off 
  - It s spot welded on . So theoretically possible but lots of work
- - Did he have any assurance that none of his previous students would attempt to overthrow him 
  - Which other previous students would have the power or skill to  Even Yoda failed ...
- - Nope  ca nt understand your question . How do they look before they re awesome 
  - Well clearly they do nt just take a snap shot all in one and it s just that amazing looking .
- - I think the community is too small to split it in two .
  - I agree . I just offer suggestions .
- - Is it always just a bagel and cream cheese or do you sometimes have it with some eggs  fruit  or any other breakfast food 
  - I may sometimes throw in a banana  muffin  or other various things  but I stay with routine .
- - Makes sense . Going out on weekends and being a single guy taking girls on dates are probably my biggest expenses next to rent .
  - Haha yeah dating is pricey no matter where you live  but I can imagine this is especially true up there
- - I just finished using that same yarn to make a scarf for my sister . It s one of my new favorites

- - He does nt fight like that  ever .
  - I would nt say he never does  it s just uncommon .
- - Anyone but the Cowboys . I hate football  and do nt understand it at all  but have an irrational hatred for the cowboys lol .
  - You re a good gal in my book then 
- - You know I promised myself I would nt be like this It did nt work
  - I also promised myself I would nt ever buy skins or keys . I do nt want to talk about how much I ve spent on skins and keys .
- - Fuck I love this video . His refrigerator is the stuff dreams are made of .
  - Agreed . Unless you like ... wan na cook food .
- - Wow thx u this gives me a better direction
  - You re very welcome . I did nt expect you to use it exactly . But it gives you a guideline of the area you can spend on your items

  - These are not based on logic  but emotions .
- - He does not have a grown man s voice .
  - Yeah he should try voice acting maybe .

  - I m not saying that the church position is literalism  and have admitted that this appears to be an isolated case . Exactly how am I being stupid now 
- - The inserts for them are really absorbent 
  - How do they compare to baby diapers  Could one just use a baby diaper to replace the normal insert

  - Same  our sword carrier said it did no extra damage .
- - Moved is the wrong word . They were kicked out .
  - Except for the small percentage from Yemen and Iraq  nope .
  - Are you kidding me . Look at the history of Moroccan Jews . Oppressed and purged for hundreds of years . Only a few thousand remain .
  - slow down now  I think the truth is somewhere in between
- - Jesus did exist though ... Just nvm man .
  - Like King Arthur  it s most likely that he was a real figure  but there s not actually enough evidence to conclusively say they did .
- - Sometimes  you just got ta let the boys breathe .
  - It s to balance out the movement of his upper body while repairing  just like a cat uses its tail .
- - ITT . A lot of people who would nt like me .
  - Haha oh no  How come  We still love you .

  - He s sad because he knows he s getting shards for it .
- - She s going to turn into a ham very quickly now that she s turned FA .

  - Is it one of the Dresden series  I know he narrates those ...
  - Yep  this particular scene was in Death Masks  which is the fifth book in the Dresden Files series .
  - Aaaaand I m off to Audible brb .
- - Good point on the carbs . I forgot I used to eat salami . Some frown on it because of nitrates but I get the fancier dry cured stuff .
  - Yeah you generally want to take anything with nitrates in moderation . Also  watch for added sugar in PB . There s usually a lot more than you would think
- - DAE remember the time when we did nt have access to the knowledge of the whole world  anywhere  anytime  I do . It was shitty .
  - Yeah  the library was almost popular back then . Lol . Did I say library  I meant ignorance and dumb questions .
- - Congrats  Are you going to evolve it into Vileplume or Bellosom 
  - Not sure . What would you suggest 
- - you are correct . I always assumed it would be said with joy  not anger .
  - There is a lot of passion involved .
- - Baseball is so boring  even a guy opening a bottle in the audience is better TV material .
  - Only sport I ve seen where the commercials provide better entertainment than the game
- - He ll be involved in Margaery s trial  not Cersei s .
  - Margaery is nt doing a trial by combat .
- - With new japan world it goes to on demand right after it airs live . So I ll wake up well rested and watch with my morning coffee .
  - Does it air live on new japan world 
- - You should learn your chemistry well and read up about methanol poisoning then .
  - What just ... general chemistry  Organic chemistry for a start would probably be better right  But anything specific 
- - I did nt need to do a roll seeing as this kill was mod sanctioned .
  - Well you should have said that then . Carry on .
- - Because parody  even bad parody  is Constitutionally protected despite what the Republicans claim .
  - I think you re being down voted because parody is not constitutionally protected . It is because of conventional legislation that parody is protected .
- - Still pretty badass imo . Did you get her arrested 
  - yep . canned her like a tuna .
- - The girl running across the screen at the end makes it .
  - For some reason she reminds of a black guy who just reacted to somebody getting dissed really bad .
- - Dark Sectors are garbage because no incentive and bad gameplay . They should make them Archwing based tbh .
  - That s not a terrible idea  but im biased because i love archwing
- - Same here  I think I still know most of the lyrics to that one
  - I never punch a tourist even if he deserved it . An amish man like me  You know that s unheard of 
- - I watched it with no volume . Did I miss out on something 
  - I watched it with no volume too  I still cringed
- - Yepp my husband is a soldier and at work now on lockdown . Have nt heard from him in like half an hour .
  - I am sure he is fine . The shooter has killed himself and it seems the other person he killed is a doctor . Sad .
  - Yeah  I commented that when it was still in progress . He is fine  praise God .
  - Glad to hear your husband is okay  Wishing you the best 
- - Does nt need to be a red flag  but hard to tell from this picture .
  - I m as flat as an ironing board but not comfy enough to wear a bra . Do I look androgynous 
- - If this movie is as dull as her acting in the HP series I wo nt be watching
  - I think she is better in the role of a villain  But see for yourself . There will be some trailers up soon
- - So just cut it open  Surely taking four pictures of it was more infuriating than finding a knife
  - Already done . Figured I d share before doing that though .
- - This is nt my first username lol This is an incognito acct since my job would can me if they found out I smoked
  - That s wonderful  thanks for sharing  Keep fightin the good fight and do nt get fired for trees .
- - I doubt that was actually an advocate  probably just someone trying to make the opposition look bad .
  - Seriously  Because if you want to false flag  you do it in a private communication that likely wo nt be made public 
- - This is just what I happened to comment on . Please do not take it as a personal attack or anything  I m sorry if it was taken that way .
  - I m not  it s just that I find it annoying that people ignore UK .
  - If you want I ll go condemn him too .
  - Please do  at least it would but me at rest .
- - I mean  Videos . can i post Montage Parody Vids or should i post it here first 
  - Well we are turning on approved submitters in around a week so if you want to post an approval request now you can .
- - Instead of moaning about not having heard of him  I d advise maybe googling him . He s quite the despicable bastard
  - Ok  he s a backwards political wingnut that the world would be better without . My point remains valid .

  - Heh not sure  but wii remotes through expensive TV s are an all too common occurrence .
- - That purple is PERFECT . What color is that 
  - Yeah  I m commenting here to come back and check for the response . I really like that colour .
- - Yeah I have a lot of old chums ... Gon na have to call them out for never tongue punching me fartbox ...
  - You should it s literally the nicest thing one can do for friends .
- - Did anyone notice how wrinkled his shirt is  Should it be that way or did he just wake up and pull it out of the dirty clothes 
  - Clean shirts can wrinkle as well . Have you done laundry 
- - Lets be honest  it looks shit lol .
  - Agreed  but some people will disregard that simply because Samuel L Jackson is in it .
- - Saw all the stuff to read  il just take your word for it
  - Too bad  this one s multilayer .
- - First team that comes to mind is NE  On what basis 
  - History from what Tom Brady did with Randy Moss
- - Small scar on my lip from being chased by a rooster when I was younger . Scar under my chin from an attempt to skateboard .
  - I have a scar under my chin courtesy learning to ride a bike .
- - Well most god s already have a death animation so I do nt think it would work out .
  - It would simply disable the death animation and instead ragdoll .
- - Greatest catch in Seahawks history . Malcolm Smith 
  - Sorry  Danny  that is incorrect . The correct answer is Sidney Rice vs. Bears .
- - If you do nt do SS or SL  you re wrong .
  - deload  post form check  sleep more  and if you have to ask you are nt ready for it
- - The kids would say tacos . Man  they love tacos .

  - No he signed for the rest of this season  allegedly .
- - We can augment the argument with the standard theistic arguments about what properties god must have . For the sake of brevity  I did nt include this in the OP .
  - Could you add them in  It may help .
- - I guess there may be another gem war in the future .
  - They re coming to take Earth back .
- - Environmental health is not one you want unless you are interested in public health or similar .
  - That s what I thought  so Environmental Studies could be better .
- - School is a great place to learn what you want to do . Pick up interesting sounding classes and try things out .
  - Thank you  that sounds like a good idea . I ll do just that . Thanks again 
- - It s perfect . It s so perfect  It might be too perfect .
  - Ahh I m so ecstatic I need to a secondary comment to say how perfect this is 
- - Leeds have a player named Sloth . That s so good .
  - Apparently it s pronounced Slut  Commentators hate him 
- - They added this to stop people from boosting or smurfing .

  - also most of them will have more than one smurf
- - Whats the deal with bronze baddies bitching about riven players 
  - Basicly you re just proving OP s point
- - I ve got that exact piece but it s a bit bigger and I love it .

- - Fantastic shot . Has nt lost its charm on me yet .
  - Thanks  Me either  I do nt want the magic to end . It was an amazing day 
- - If consoles are so goood  why that peasant is looking for PC on ebay 
  - Could be one of those people who just looks around in that area to spew this kind of nonsense .
- - Genie . Imprisoned . Totally possible to find his lamp and release him upon the town of Storybrooke 
  - Now that would be some rather cool viewing  and another way to get them back into Storybrooke right enough .
  - I waited all of the Wonderland spin-off to see Jasmine and never did ... would love to see her in Storybrooke 
  - I never realized they skipped her until I read this . She did nt really fit in with wonderland but I d love to see her too 
- - I remember reading that nasa has classified photos of the moon . I always wondered why . Maybe this 
  - I think i see an JJ Abrams lense flare coming off of it too
- - Honestly nothing is wrong with it . I do like having a car tbh . More or less the housing in NY is a bigger thing for me .
  - Is it the cost or is it the space  Cost I could understand but the space is very doable especially if you are living alone .
- - First BANK . Good Service  ever will credit you for withdraws from Fees from using other Bank ATMs
  - Yep I love first Bank as well  No ATM fees is killer when traveling and free snacks and bottled water in the lobbies is always great 
- - They are considering removing Cruel all together no  If you people do nt like the game  play something else .
  - Wow  what a helpful comment . And no  they said they would not be removing a difficulty .
- - No part of this article had anything to do with technology .
  - But it says something bad about Comcast  so of course it went straight to the front page .
- - It warms my soul when celebrities give back .
  - It mean it warms your heart that they publicized that they gave back . What about the ones who do nt 
- - dont bring traveler s checks . My buddies had a very hard time finding places to cash these and brought a good amount of stress and wasted time .
  - Does anybody use traveler s checks anymore 
- - I do nt understand what was wrong with Scorch  I thought he was alright .
  - Alright  He s the greatest mascot ever

- - Does a non-caged bear shit in the woods 
  - Not if that non-caged bear lives in the desert
  - TIL that there are non-caged bears that live in the desert .
  - Polar Bears . Biggest of all bears .
- - I was honestly surprised it was bigger than Texas .
  - You need to switch from the Meridian to the Peters projection map .
- - They need a longer NXT so these matches are nt so short . Theirs more demand then there is product .
  - Leave us wanting more  something desperately needed on raw
- - Decent high schools would remove any need .
  - I agree  but it s easier to throw money at a problem for a couple years than to do something meaningful to fix it .
- - Great kid  watched him and Tristan when they played for Texas . Canadians are slowly taking over  we coming for dat ass .
  - That was a great year at UT . I was hoping they would ve stayed longer .
- - They re actually trying to dodge potholes  they do nt mean to be reckless
  - I feel your pain on the potholes  Minnesotan here . Spring looks like a war zone on the roads
- - Not really . Most exercises like running or cycling suppress your appetite in the short term . Or so I heard . Something to do with heat loss in the water .
  - Oh interesting . The heat loss part sounds very plausible .
- - I suppose that s what I ll have to do . Thanks for the help .
  - I have the exact same problem - did power washing the chromebook fix everything

  - Unfortunately  my boss owns the company . So there s really nothing that can be done about it .
- - It s called Silent Aim  friend of mine codes those  it basically hits the target without that you aim at it
  - Genuinely interested  how do you deal with a friend coding hacks

  - Yes  that s it . Just wait in the in game menu while you win a challenge .
- - Do nt squeeze his head with your legs and do nt make him do it underneath blankets . I know the feeling too well .
  - Definitely not under the blankets . It s hard enough to breathe without a blanket trapping out all the air . He d also probably overheat really quickly .
- - I looked it up obviously . I have always seen it as reactive power . I still do nt like the term .
  - As I ve said repeatedly - no one cares whether you like it or not . Deal with it .
- - Add struts  Are you using mods  If so  which ones

- - I sincerely hope I m wrong on this  but unless I was doing something wrong when I tried you ca nt link additional user accounts to your nintendo ID .
  - I appear to be incorrect  sorry 
- - lol  Peaceful Muslims who say nothing  There are entire conventions dealing on these exact issue . People who ve lost their own lives while spreading the message of peace .
  - Those conventions obviously are nt working . At this point  the only logical path to peace is to stamp out ALL religion .
  - Oh  stop . Denying people their right to faith will only incite more violence and you know it . Nobody likes being told what to do .
  - It would nt need to incite violence if these people were more reasonable . Eventually you have to grow up and learn that Santa Claus is nt real .
- - Do you have a picture of the inside 
  - It was lined so no inside pictures .
- - Many regrets for doing the same thing . Did nt have anything else to do though while at my parents for the holidays . Next year will be different .
  - Next year . Next year will be different .
- - The Worlds End was my favorite then Shaun of the Dead and then I didnt like Hot Fuzz
  - The fact that this is only the sixth answer is complete nonsense . Easily the best . Tighter  wittier  smarter  more mature .
- - The morbidly curvy ladies of SRS are extremely offended by your observation .
  - You can just imagine their typing wands going into overdrive .
- - Seems to me like Chris used to really like Jesus ...
  - Ha  it s a Doobie Brothers allusion

  - Thanks  hopefully I can get some more free time to work on the trees .
- - I ca nt wait to see this in the dollar bin at Walmart .
  - i m a fan of Trejo so I figured this might be good . Let s see though .
- - Pretty sure you never did BIAB . Also pretty sure your idea wo nt work at all .
  - I m pretty sure you re not a very nice person .
- - I like how Detroit forgets that they re Detroit .
  - I like how Dallas forgets they re Dallas .
- - Did you catch a username  I ll be on soon to fix it
  - Nah  they did it when I wasnt on .
- - WOOT  New Commonwealth can into relevance 
  - New Commonwealth . The Birthplace of Canning . That ll be sure to attract tourists 
- - Even Google does nt seem to index all the comments .
  - That may have to do with people s settings . There s an option to toggle whether or not your comments are searchable .
- - Ah just outside Tucson  AZ beautiful area even if crime is a bit of an issue in the city .

  - I m not touching that it s the polices bussiness .
- - does the koi warrior have increased chances to get them or something 
  - I do nt know if it s been proven . I think it s pretty common opinion though that you seem to get the most from him for whatever reason .
- - Nah  I have you to do the grunt work . Ya  I never look anything up . Too many aliens on le googl
  - Attacking him with a moronic fallacy sure does get that point across champ ... . D
- - It s not so much that it s not a contract year as it is not playing with John Wall anymore .
  - He still gets open looks though  the guy plays with Harden who s a great passer . John Wall should nt be the reason he s shooting so poor .
- - First you beat him at Open Field Masters  now this  Give the poor guy a break  . P
  - Yeah but I m the Open Field Masters Master I beat everyone on there  unless im lagging  then it does nt count
- - Thank you so much for posting this . I was having a bad day and this made me laugh out loud .
  - Glad you enjoyed it . It s these little moments that can make a big difference in my attitude too .
- - Are you a walrus cuz those are some nice tusks
  - I may as well be . Or a chipmunk at least with how swollen them cheeks are .
- - Stupidity is no excuse for putting the safety of monsters ahead of the safety of children  as Hagrid did on countless occasions .
  - got any examples  i ca nt really think of one . he s never put the safety of a child above the safety of a beast i think .
- - I would lose my ability to speak .
  - I have lost my ability to can .
- - Eris bounties were nt available when they bought the game and came with the expansion . How do you not see my point by now 
  - And neither was the strike that is being used as the weekly and Nightfall  how can you not see mine 
- - You know what they say about a man with big fingers  They be sayin  dam  You got some big fingers 
  - OMG  Thanks for the Fresh Prince reference 
- - Is it overall better  Worth the time to create a profile and actually be able to message people

  - yup  and in a many states  it is even illegal to catch your own rain water .
- - i wonder if you could selectively breed parrots for intelligence until they become human like
  - That would take such a long time that we probably would nt be speaking languages that are even remotely similar to the ones we are speaking now .
- - There are benefits to having a god awful team . There s no reason to drink when you have no hope as it is . D
  - nah  you guys are going to be like Cal was this year . Sneak good . Borderline Bowl team
- - That was possibly the worst tackle attempt I ve ever seen .
  - He did nt want to overshoot him and get juked by the move the Oregon player did in fact do . Not much he could do there
- - Its why I did nt liquid cool my current rig
  - On the other hand  just build a gun into the case and have it securely shipped that way . P
- - It d be wonderful . Too bad silent Stan will never let it happen . Here s to hoping for an expansion team
  - You guys can steal the Jaguars in a few years
- - It s funny that linda is voiced by a guy .
  - Voiced by a guy basically doing an impression of his mother
- - what  I also have the eevee D .

  - me neither  got a communication error right after the trade
  - so did I ... I m gon na try to power off and back on  see what happens ...

  - THE OTHER HUMAN WILL INFLICT PAIN ON THE FIRST HUMAN  INDUCING A SENSATION OF REGRET OVER ALTERNATIVE CAREER CHOICES .
- - how about this  play realistic  and hit the wings up instead . they go down much faster .

  - Combo Druid or Mech Mage Zoo and Hunter is alright against it .

- - What does this have to do with black people .
  - its something a black person would post to twitter . Or did
- - Dear fucking Lord how do we beat them in the WCF 
  - I do nt know but I really need you guys to find a way to do it .

  - Yeah that s pretty much my thought . A RETURN TO THE AGE OF KINGS . That game is probably why I like history and game of thrones so much
- - Quality pickup  Currently saving up for a pair as well .
  - Awesome man . They re dope for sure
- - we must not give up our freedom of speech for these religious fanatics 
  - We ought not be afraid because that s exactly what the terrorists want .
- - Interested . Are you interested in any trades 
  - PM me what you have to offer .
- - I squealed like a little girl . Very envious of your collection .
  - Me too ... What the hell do you guys do to have so much money for Lego 
- - Way up north where the air is cold  I lost all my money and I lost all my gold ...
  - I beg you do nt finish the song 
- - He was a good casting choice  I agree  but I think that RDJ is very close . So best cast side character  definitely 
  - I like how RDJ does Tony  but it s quite different to Tony in the comics .
- - Bears fans were always obsessed with cutler and only now are realizing hes super average .
  - I d say he s above average easily . But not so much that he s going to go out and put the team on his back or anything
- - I think your friend should see a therapist . She has some issues .
  - Nope  just incredibly nave and clueless  unfortunately .
- - You do nt need to capitalize every word in your title .
  - Do you not know how titles work 
- - Probably a Glock . I can check and double check the chamber and I still cringe when I remove the slide .
  - Fairly certain it was a glock  but since I could nt remember for sure I decided not to say it .
- - There s also the apple podcasts app and you can find them all on soundcloud
  - Yeah  not really looking to download some apple app to listen to content I used to enjoy on cracked .
- - I have a lifelong goal to bartend on every continent . How realistic is it for me to do a shift in your bar 
  - Well you d have to get a day job doing something else here first . But after that  it s easy .
- - Is Jaques gon na be in this season of JonTron  I miss that bird .
  - Are Jaques and Jon still friends

- - Would nt you rather spend those coins on an attacker  Much more exciting imo .
  - I already have Aguero and Crespo so I think I m covered there .
- - I m not quite sure what you mean . Batoto has pretty much all of the best translations that exist .
  - As do a lot of other sites .
- - Dude I m not cheating . I just go for the chance knife in smoke every time .
  - Pretty sure I legged him  so I m just gon na go for the chance knife here .
- - Property crimes are still crimes and should be heavily punished . Not death penalty punished but dealt with harshly .
  - I was pointing out that your reasoning was fallacious  not arguing that property crime should go unpunished .
- - Can you explain how someone can go about using your SIN if they do nt have the same name as you 
  - They say they have the same name as you and assume your identity when enrolling for things 
- - Definitely at the site of the moon landing . The look of utter confusion on Neil s face would be priceless .
  - Even better  on Mars near where one of the rovers landed . Everyone would freak out and say Mars can support plant life
- - then you buy a lot of stuff that you do nt need and let the airline pay for it
  - That s making lemonade out of lemons but I ve never found it made up for the hassle of the airline losing your bag when you re on holiday .
- - Keep doing quests . You ll have to do them eventually and they take you through the world map .
  - Since your new Questing is the best way to get to know the game
- - That s so much more simple to use than the one in my car .
  - I know  it s also really satisfying to look at .
- - and worse still they do nt take their swimming shorts off in the sauna .
  - No one really does that in America either though  not that it means anything
- - I do nt know why whether or not the Consulate drew their weapons is a big deal . IDF actually shoots stone throwers .
  - Not if they re settlers . They protect violent settlers attacking arabs  destroying their farms  and property . When settlers throw stones at arabs .
- - How do you get into that area with the guns 
  - Each one is different  tons of people create their own so you have to be lucky to figure it out  or just follow where the crowd goes .
- - not sure tbh . just got it an hour ago .
  - not looking to offer on my own trade not really interested unless its for a great price sorry
- - I m based in London and considering doing the exact same thing  good for you 
  - Thanks  Good luck if you decide to go for it 
- - There s a big difference between watching kids fall and hearing an animal die and do nt do anything .
  - to be fair we had no idea that the bird was dying . He was just being loud and annoying . We could not know he would die .
- - Something was moving under that blanket in the backseat . I hope it was nt a baby .
  - I noticed that too . The blue blanket moved from one side to the other and back ...
- - I d argue this is true for basically all majority religions in basically all countries .
  - Islam does not fit your description in many many nations .
- - Oh god  I wish I could . Give me the code  and I would fix this .
  - That is what GGG is saying too .
- - Thank you for actually considering this unlike most people who speculate about Babcock .
  - To most Leafs fans its become another joke along with Crosby  Stamkos  etc . Its almost absurd to think anyone big great wants to come here anymore .
- - The most common way that we try British accents is basically watching a lot of Monty Python or Harry Potter than crudely try and talk like them  lol
  - I ve learned so much from watching Monty python .
- - America s snoring appears to be dyslexic .
  - sorry  I ca nt write z s correctly . One of my issues  really rekt me on spelling tests .
- - I became extremely skinny and little me would have loved me to be much more muscular . Yes  I know I should start working out .
  - If you re healthy it really does nt matter what size you are
- - I do nt want to give up  I ll trow this poison into the sink and never look back 
  - Relapse happens  At one point I had quit smoking for four months before I went right back . Just keep on trucking and do a little better each time .

  - I live in Portland and work as a software developer ... I feel fancy if I wear anything even slightly dressier than a hoodie .
- - Did you just watch a Disney movie 
  - No I thought I lived in a Disney movie . D
- - Added you  I ll let you know when we re both online 
  - You have a rock type safari with Corsola and Boldore .
- - Buzz kill ... you could save yourself the time and just look at one of the videos on YT .
  - It s not about seeing it . It s about getting there myself . The journey is what I value not the destination .
- - Ron Swanson should be in Advice Animals . Great response OP .
  - I think this one s got potential .
- - Hiding in my boyfriend s room from his parents  whose house I m at for the first time  in a city I do nt know anyone else in .
  - Why are you hiding from his parents 
- - That truly varies from person to person  depending upon their usage . It s hard to say like that . The best way is to find out yourself .
  - Ok  thanks . I ll try the white bg  and see for myself .
- - You have nt travelled much have you  White Western Europeans are some of the most tolerant people in the world .
  - That is very true and they bend over backwards to accommodate other cultures .
- - A lot of my friends who are in their twenties and work in NYC live in Hoboken . It s a fun area for young professionals .
  - Hoboken is hip to this now and the cost of living is increasing .
- - Want a Joker of Dark or Earth for that Arthur 
  - No thanks  I m not looking for jokers right now aside for maybe metal .
- - Highest scoring GK in the the league 
  - I ll take any positive stat  especially if it involved a goal scored in our favor .
- - How did LA Noire stop your killing sprees  Did nt it make your car swerve to avoid pedestrians 
  - Magic jumping pedestrians who pretty much would nt die  it was impressive to watch  really .
- - It s pretty unfortunate that you have to put a giant watermark over the entire video because some dipshit stole your character . Great work though 
  - A lot of dipshits stole my character . So far I have put down one game  a twitter page  and a facebook page .
- - Just to be clear this is not Mordor 
  - Came to say it was actually the road to Mordor . Not convinced it s not .
- - YOU can report her to the state . Please . Do nt just hope your boss did it .
  - If OP can I hope OP does . Your doing great OP  do nt get intimidated now 
- - If a man in a bathrobe tells you to jump to your death  do nt do it .
  - Wow that is exactly where I m at in the show . What a coincidence 
- - As much as he said not to post it ... I m curious what the exploit actually is .
  - The gist is you can get op loot without doing the work .
- - Yes  it is called a Schedule of Values .
  - I was referring to an actual work schedule . Thanks .
- - How do the buckling spring pair up to blues  I d like to know because I saw this board yesterday on ebay too .
  - Blues are very different  compared to buckling springs . Buckling springs have a actuation that s more consistent throughout  with a louder click . I prefer them .
- - and that member of raid who enters first  Balls of Steel 
  - Too bad his teammates did nt follow ... and one of them are shooting  I hope  over his head .
- - Yea  I have never seen this before  I have mixed feelings about this  is this really a new thing that chicks like their tampon string hanging out .
  - It s a tampon dude  she s on her period ...
- - Unlike pretty much every other bowl sponsor  all this talk about food actually makes me want to consume their product .
  - I mean  I m getting BWW for our bowl ...
  - I m getting actual wings that taste good for our game haha
  - ehh  I think BWW is pretty good . But I m sure there s better out there .
- - I do nt think it should be allowed  it really is a disadvantage for the people who ca nt get it to work .
  - Difference between moving house or getting better Internet and WTFast 
- - Should have said she could do that to you instead of the other way .
  - You are right . Too late now .
- - OMG he talked to ME  I feel smarter already .
  - I m sure you re already smart enough 
- - My cloud to butt extension has never been funnier .
  - Even your comment with cloud to butt is great .
- - Yeah  I meant the other one .
  - I m not sure the other one did anything more than this . I have nt noticed her in anything but this . Sorry .
- - Will there be any way in the future to get the gear from competitions that have already ended  do you know 
  - It s been strongly hinted by Ubisoft reps here that the gear will be unlocked in the near future
- - Hey when terrorists gunned down a bunch of people in Paris today  what was the first explanation that came into your mind  Atheists  right 
  - Is that why you speak to me in such a rude manner  because you like to imagine that those are my thoughts 
  - I know you immediately knew it was muslims  just like everyone did
  - You lost me - what has that got to do with anything 
- - Hitting the gym helped me a lot .
  - Good idea . I ve done that . Actually  I ve always done that and I think it s my crutch . I m gon na look into other things .
- - You know what  Those people are right  there ca nt possibly be life on other planets 
  - No that d totally shatter the arrogant and entitled mindset that much of the general populace has
- - So  do you happen to know anyone that might know anything about wells  I do nt know who is rural here other than myself .
  - Not off the top of my head . I definitely do nt . Sorry .

- - Blow their nose with toilet paper  and put it in a trash can . Why not flush it  so nobody else has to touch it 
  - You touch used toilet paper in the trashcan  Lol
- - I only ever post the anime charts  so it makes perfect sense on the post karma one . REKT on the others though .
  - That just means Kruzy puts out more Quality content then you do .
- - I do nt know . But something lowly in my opinion . That lady will live with that memory for the rest of her life . So should he .
  - Its ironic because by her own admission she ca nt remember what happened because she was very drunk .
- - That is because pirates actually play the games .
  - Implying paying customers only play online or multiplayer  Tbh my real life experiences say that s correct
- - Not really . Many atheists are just as intolerant of religions as many religions are of each other .
  - they may be intolerant but maybe they have a good reason to be intolerant
- - Yes this is a totally sustainable way to avoid ever coming down . be high forever .
  - With a short enough lifespan  it could work . Would nt be very much fun though .
- - I ca nt wait for the Rogan episode .
  - Yeah  one of the first things that came to my mind haha
- - League of Legends  anime  homework  or sleep .

  - Sure  Paying it forward  I like it  take your pick 
- - Why do nt you double search the images she sent you on google
  - I tried reverse searching each picture but nothing came up .
- - I love marmite and the thought of that makes me wince .
  - I hate marmite . The theory is correct .
- - Do nt EVER join a person s fireteam who is in your Strike . They will boot you from the match so their friends can join .
  - that s the SGA I will now make sure to follow when doing strike . i am not taking any chance .
- - I m proud to say I knew most of facts here  I had no idea about his insane driving habits though  that s beautiful .
  - I was surprised he drove at all to be honest
- - Lol you are nt even a mod why are you attempting to enforce rules . What s your problem 
  - Maybe he s just being a good user and pointing out the rules to someone before we get involved .
- - Nate is great about giving you the impression many times that there are certain things he ca nt talk about but are very close .
  - Exactly my thought . It was also in current Palmer interviews  where you could see he was very excited to share more information  but he could nt .
- - At least Road Dogg seems to have a sense of humor .
  - I do nt think Gunn s tweet was meant to be angry . The New Age Outlaws and the Young Bucks might have even run into each other on the indies .
- - Gotcha . I m a Texan myself .
  - I definitely had an adjustment period when I moved away  You re certainly right in Texas - it would have felt presumptuous to take off my shoes .

  - Reverend Stephen Smith ... Related to Stephen A. Smith 
- - can I ask what makes you say that 
  - because his answer technically covers every amount of time possible  it just sounds like he is answering the question . Very clever of him .
- - Thanks a lot  very helpful feedback 
  - WHAT  NO UPVOTE  I QUIT 
- - We were trying to do that but Tyreek was insistent on dicking you guys and us over .
  - I know that feeling  if it makes you feel any better .
- - You would think UW s defense would be used to offenses like this from the PAC
  - Lot of guys thinking about the draft methinks
  - No one on offense is and yet they re laying an egg .
  - the offense has layed plenty of eggs this year  your defense though is stacked with early round picks that just do nt want to get hurt this game
- - BRB  checking if If there is a naked middle aged fat man in my couch .
  - If so  dryer sheets should make it all better .
- - Dude thats so awesome you finally got pit . Now who are you missing 
  - The Trinity  lol impossible to find 
  - Posible but not imposible go to TRU and look in the DI and Skylanders section someone got a marth that way
  - Oh snap  im going to start doing that as well 
- - Your GIF starts after the receiver initiated contact by grabbing Hitchen s face mask ... Pretty misleading .
  - That is the point - the LB was holding  then the incidental facemask  then the LB held and interfered with the receiver .
- - Sorry for not solving your issue ... but if you are using the mouse you are probably doing something wrong ... do you really need it 
  - no i really dont need it . Just curious and a good thing to learn .

  - we do nt keep any other drugs around

  - Had a look at the skis and looks like I should be able to fit them up 
- - They look sooo pretty and creamy i want themm
  - They ; re almost too creamy  When I swatched them  they started to squish  I had to use light pressure to apply 
- - I m surprised they did nt at least take a second look at that one .
  - Yeah I would ve thought they would .
- - But  PGE appeared in skyrim ... the most cannon game
  - You can blame Kurt for that one .
- - Wow what s the new tech in that thing that warranted a new release 
  - I wish they gave more data . There seems to be some write acceleration  but beyond that  I have no idea .
- - Yes that s the policy on our unit . And employees who have been hospital patients there themselves can be fired for looking up their own chart through our charting system .
  - Honest question  why is that  Why should nt a patient be able to see their own chart 
- - That sucks . If you want to rant to a random girl in the UK then I m a good listener .
  - I m actually a UK girl  came here for a job because there was nothing in England D .

  - It s a bad angle but my character is in the rear passenger seat . His body is mostly outside the frame of the car .
- - If a state does nt grant them gay marriages they are not spouses . Thats the fundamental flaw with your argument . Again  your reasoning rests on faulty assumptions .
  - What s the difference between not recognizing gay marriages and not recognizing interracial marriages 
- - Holy moly  you have a hell of a seat .
  - That s not my picture . I wish I had those seats .
- - Shreveport  LA here . Would love to find some people to share cooking tips and things with .

- - I ve scrubbed this thing and it looks fine syntax wise .
  - Wow  thanks . What do you think the issue is then 
- - Nigga  you dumb . Scottish ones are still being made .
  - The people who make the pass card disagree with you .
- - Ha  Did you give her cheese after that 
  - I gave her some macaroni and cheese ... so technically yes 
- - Wish it went the other way of course  but that was a good game 
  - Hell of a game  ACC basketball  baby . Love it .
- - Agreed ... Hate for other teams is hard to break even during the bowl games ... Also  you can not help but cheer for Gordon  that dude can run
  - He s fun to watch  yeah .
- - Ugh pigs trying to be other animals .
  - An insult against fatties AND furries . D .
- - Spirals . They go with most sauces and meats  Tuna bake with spirals . Golden .
  - Goddamn spiral mac and cheese is twice as good as the regular stuff
- - Oddly this is directly relevant to another big news today .
  - Censorship is always an active issue . As long as you bother to look for it  you ll see it .

- - Go for the pebble steel  its worth the extra couple bucks Also i think best buy is still doing a promo for it if you have a.edu address
  - Yeah gon na have to pass . I dont really want to spend that much for something I will only wear at night .
- - I will literally spend a thousand dollars to build a gaming pc just to play this game when they announce it .
  - Only a thousand  Where s your dedication 
- - Got ta respect his Germanic dedication to perfection .
  - Faust . As long as humanity strives  it is good .
- - almost sure is SA server ... if u re there may the gods be with u
  - It s actually EUW . When you re this low in MMR  anything goes no matter the server
- - nice photo . pointless post  but nice photo nonetheless .
  - Yeah  unfortunately I did nt have a photo of a gun laying on the ground .
- - not with a wad of cash  if they want visits with a shrink or some other counseling then he should pay for that .
  - but its something that they lost that cant be fixed with a shrink . They are forever on the internet naked  and not to their own fault at all .
- - Does nt stop idiots from thinking he is and the rest of them are going to main event WM .
  - I have nt seen that claim once anywhere .
- - You ca nt repair the damage unless you stay stopped . But maybe do the withdrawal under a doctor s supervision 
  - Yes . Thank you . FANTASTIC IDEA 
- - I know its the minority opinion here  but I enjoy the look .
  - You re not alone . I love the look of the all purples .
- - As long as you do nt try to bhop in real life ...
  - yeah  strafing does nt really work IRL
- - I think Nostalgia Critic got much worse when it came back after it was dead . It should have stayed dead .
  - They brought on extra cast members and the show fell harder than Game grumps
- - I ca nt figure out what s going on in that picture . Is the Porsche split in half with a mirror three-quarters through it 
  - Now that you mention it  I ca nt either . Something to do with it being a prototype body I assume .
- - urine does nt build up in your penis  she actually thought that the penis filled with urine  as opposed to blood .
  - Oh  yeah  that s untrue .
- - The penalty for slavery ought to be death by firing squad  no exceptions .
  - Disagree  slavery should be a Life In Prison  No Parole situation . Give people plenty of time to think about how they fucked up .
- - Its sad that you need to post this  should be common sense .
  - Hey  hey  hey  hey ... Want me to dupe your cards 
- - I wish they rehashed F-Zero and just put an online mode in it .
  - How about remake GX like they did Wind Waker 
- - Hi and welcome to the sub  What kind of books do you like to read

- - I m not entirely sure what you are asking . We can create magnets . And the earths magnetic field have nothing to do with gravity .
  - OP is probably thinking of levitation such as with hoverboards .
- - Too many variables to consider  but the reality is an overcrowded job market an Associates is nt that big of a deal . What are you looking for 
  - either something clerical or an assistant manager position at a retail store .
  - I d think you re qualified and competitive for that . Do you want to post your resume for review 
  - I can do that  but how do I do that without having any personal information on it and still have it look good
