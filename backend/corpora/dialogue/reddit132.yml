  - And helms man . Ud have their necks jutting out so far that helms that should flow from top to shoulders now just float out in the middle of nowhere .
- - Shanahan s play calling really was strange those last few games . Not good that he s gone but it ll be interesting to see who we bring in

  - Shut up Emma Watson we didnt even get any nudes from you  you have no right to speak on this thread
- - Why is nt it  His back wheels and tail are off the ground
  - I guess I had to watch it a few times  but I thought he just scraped his tail . My bad .

  - But you did nt manage to read my comment then

  - Sure we can  We just need to find the good stuff
- - Yaaaay  lets all be pissed off at each other irl 
  - haha we might be  But why 
- - At least there is a plausible deniability factor involved then  I was nt aware of that .
  - Deniability to what  Is this a new conspiracy theory that I do nt know of 
  - I wouldnt say new  ive been thinking about it for the last few years . This picture sparked it off  actually .
  - So what have you been thinking about 
- - i love when players of opposite teams help each other to get up
  - Same here  shows a level of respect and class on both sides .
- - Can you just make the grace period last forever unless you take some kind of action or move  This would save so many HC lives

  - I d be fine with him running  too . If you put him and Warren together  it d be even better .
- - From whatever I ve heard about masters programs  if you re paying for them  you re doing it wrong
  - Masters programs in CS are rarely funded by the University . However  it s realistic to have an employer pay for it .

  - And if you re buying either as an investment  it s a bad one .
- - Does she ever drink with you  Would you like to drink together 
  - Sometimes  with her familly too . But often  i drink alone  that s my problem .

  - Good . Goood . Feel the power flow through you

  - I disagree with some elements of socialism myself  but out of curiosity can you give me a few examples of what you disagree with  specifically  about socialism 
- - This should be higher . I hope that reporter was blowing smoke when he said Roseman was pissed about this .
  - BusinessInsider is garbage  Yahoo sourcing it does nt make it any more legit .

- - Yi pulls out the sweeper De legend De God salute
  - i am more amazed someone had a sweeper in bronze
- - I do nt think it s as easy as that . Coaches generally handpick their staff . He has exactly who he wants and believes he works best with .

- - You bring the girls  I ll bring the beer  and the troops ll bring the freedom ...
  - Do nt forget about Jesus and his pick-up truck .

- - Women are nt physically as good as men at most sports due to differences of biology . I have prepared my butthole .
  - Testosterone is a hell of a drug .
- - Is the gamepad set to controller by any chance 
  - No  it is nt . I can move and do everything with my keyboard  but it just does nt register the movement of my mouse .
