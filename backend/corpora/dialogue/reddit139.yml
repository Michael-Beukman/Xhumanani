  - I ll probably go back to it at some point  but would it be possible to skip it for now to play the second game 
- - Oh man  I just figured how they re going to use this money they got from Brady . Extensions no new contracts .
  - They did nt get any money from Brady

- - If you ever need to make a bonfire  you can use this vest as firewood .
  - That was my thought  too . This vest would make great kindling .
- - Why are you asking  What does it matter  You are worried about the wrong thing . The bible is factual ; that s all that matters .
  - I would say I am more curious than worried .
- - I like the idea that executive total compensation should be capped to a multiple of the lowest paid employee . See how McDonalds CEO likes living on minimum wage .
  - You re comfortable with the granting the government the power to decide who is allowed to get paid what 
- - So they do nt call Dez for anything for being on the field . And they do nt say why they picked it up . Okay then .
  - that s what i was thinking  pretty sure when you run on the field to complain the refs that s a flag

  - Sadly  some children just ca nt help themselves . It s a real bummer .
- - Wow  some of these people are so petty .
  - Theyre getting mad about the questions to  as if we even wanted them to answer in the first place
- - Second video in the playlist ... was that accidental  It s remarkably apt .
  - No  I did nt mean to link a playlist .
- - True  but it does nt do color temperature adjustment

- - Sorry  obviously I meant to say that misogyny does nt exist .
  - Nobody said that  stop exaggerating things .
- - This show is so underrated . More people need to watch it .

  - Exactly . Good start . Keep going .
- - Why is there duck s swimming around in space 
  - does it really look like a duck  i was aiming for death star and star destroyers lasers and ... you know ... realism  but a duck 
  - Yes it does  it looks like a duck mom with her four duck babies swimming around in space .
  - haha . Interesting take on it ... It s actually cool to get this kind of feedback  thank you for being honest

  - The last statement is what you should ultimately take away from the message .

  - Really expected it to be boring and totally uninspired . It was not . It was nt a great movie  but it surely was nt bad .
- - He wo nt leave  but the idea of a player being bigger than one of the biggest clubs in the world is an incredible thing . Messi has massive power .
  - It s like they think he will live forever or something  it s madness .
- - I imagine it s tough to remember who said what .
  - Tell me about it . I keep repeating stories by accident . I m pretty sure they all assume I have memory problems .

  - I ll be on tomorrow evening or probably all day Sunday .

- - Fire Nation confirmed to sponsor CS . GO team .

  - Spoony  What kind of an insult is that  A great one ...
- - It does nt work in any outlet at your house  or only outlets 
  - Hey  it does nt work on any outlets in my room
- - Perfectly acceptable and understandable ruling . They broke a rule  but they complied and were upfront and honest about it . Good job by both sides to resolve the dispute .
  - Too bad it s not a perfectly acceptable and understandable rule .
- - This is obviously an advanced level of Kevin . Perhaps a Kevin mixed with some Chad 
  - Oh man  I was out of the Kevin loop . Thank you for that laugh .
- - Chat with hot babes on the Internet  Hm  that s so crazy it just might work 
  - I ve been doing it all day .

- - Thanks for replying . you should be getting a message from my regular account . I feel like my parents are using me like a tool .
  - I have nt gotten anything yet . What do you mean your parents are using you 
- - Edible does not mean palatable though . Some of those plants are kinda icky .
  - I mean ... grass is edible  but I would nt chow down on a plate of the stuff .
  - Anything s edible if you try hard enough .
  - If it s digestible is entirely different thing  altogether .
- - I command you to make this LED strip red 
  - If I could do that then I would actually just turn it into money .
- - he is not known for his first touch  no .
  - I am surprised to say the least  his first touches in our last two away games against Tottenham and Stoke were terrible . Hopefully just fitness .
- - Quick  be an asshole and exploit it 
  - You mean whore it out for money or slave labor  well ... ok
- - lmfao  the option with the Red Rocket . That s rich .
  - It was nt a true option . It was a play fake bootleg . They were hoping no one would be there on the outside .
- - So when did the mob get involved 
  - Ay  It s Cicero  Whattya  nuts or sumpin   The whole city is mobbed up 
- - thought you were going to say she died

  - why do we have every reason to believe it is coming out on Tuesday 
- - Let s do a second round vote for Fan Favourite .
  - but not in each season just vote for your favourite from all seasons

  - The SuperSonics Revival Tour  I d go out to a few games
- - This when Jesse becomes a likable character . Such a shift in his character when he realizes all of the effects the drug market has .

- - Happy cake day bot ... do bots celebrate their cake days 
  - Only if they also dream of electric sheep ...
- - Damn . That s pretty impressive . I mean  really incredibly stupid  but impressive .

  - I quoted from an NIH medical article on the issue ; I wonder why they reported AA batteries .
- - Aww  bummer your shameless is like that on you . I do nt like the shade on me  but I love mixing it on my lips 
  - Agree Shameless is fantastic to mix with . I mix with Bite Mulberry or WnW Sugar Plum Fairy .
- - Keyser  WV  THAT S MY HOMETOWN  I never thought I would see it being relevant on the front page . And now I must research Mr. Lambert .
  - Well hello neighbor . I am not from Keyser originally  but I lived there for a while . I m over on the Maryland side now though .
- - People that cant laugh at them selfs are boring as fuck . Have a giggle at your own expense and stop being so fucking precious .
  - But he was laughing at someone else s expense 
- - You could post this a million times  wo nt matter . There will still be people thinking that rhino horn is used in China for dicks .
  - When misinformation runs rampant . Which is all day every day .
- - Playing Rollercoaster Tycoon  once I got loads of people in my park I d slowly murder or trap them all in hellish places .

  - I bet a pig could do that as well .
  - Plot twist . op is a pig and lives on a farm  girl is also a pig on farm . They go to the same farm house each day .
- - Yeah that makes sense . Just another reason for me to hate winter time 
  - I live in Michigan  I definitely know the struggle 
- - This is the ultimate insult in MMA .
  - It s definitely the most Canadian insult in the sport .
- - AFAIK that represents the target Heimer s turrets are attempting to prioritise  which may sometimes be outside a turret s attack range .
  - Is there any logic to this  How do they know which to prioritize 
- - And then it turns out the train takes the player on a lap around Torren before coming right back to Suntouched City .
  - . D lol I ve only just got to Suntouched ... soo yea  i guess i maybe will find out soon .
- - Same here . The database should be optimised better .
  - it used to be so much faster  think the database just got too big 
- - Outstanding  I ve been trying to get a grineer look as well .
  - Thanks  wasnt east to get that right shade of green . But the orange was pretty fast

  - It just looks like a mess  like he slept with it and did nt bother to do anything so it s just caked in sweat and just kinda thrown about
- - They really need to have more railings in Rivendell . It s extremely dangerous .
  - For all those clumsy elves who can walk on snow and run across collapsing bridges midair

- - What was his role and what s yours 
  - He crafted the rules and came up with the idea for starters . I have done all else . Mostly because he wo nt .
  - Was he ever interested in trying to produce  design and market a board game or was that part your idea 
  - He was . But like me he has half-a-million unfinished projects . I liked what he had come up with and decided to help him work on it .
- - He has nothing left in the tank . Absolutely nothing .
  - He s got heart I ll give him that . But yeah this should be his last game .
- - Not a single fact to back your claims  but congrats on getting gold .
  - Last I checked  thoughts and opinions were nt always backed by facts . Personally I understand them to be just personal ideas
- - Do you have an overloaded surge protector that s plugged into a wall  We need more information here .
  - Will we ever find out if op has it in a surge protector  Find out next week
- - You are nt proving the point by being here arguing about it  not one bit .
  - Shhhhh  just let it happen . It s funnier that way .
- - Agreed . Watching that was frustrating . Refusing to leave the edge even when you are multiple stocks up is definitely cheap .
  - Almost all of those players would have lost regardless . It s up to them to get the percent lead and stay away from the ledge .
- - Well it s abuse by the state through fake cops The state was apparently getting the money from those bullshit tickets
  - private security firm ... I agree with the Lt ... its FRAUD

  - Lmao  Yeah he posted this yesterday 
- - If we continue to lose against real teams  how can he call that progress 
  - He continues to collect paychecks . It s astounding that such poor performance is tolerated from the universities highest paid employee .
- - Oh no I would never travel to a Western country . They would mistreat me regardless . But I have nt traveled outside of my country anyways .
  - Why do you think you would be mistreated in a Western country 
- - Fun fact  when his notes were reviewed he had not one bit of information on a brain aneurysms . This proved his life s work as a complete failure .
  - That s more of a depressing fact  but I ll take it .
- - Agreed  i really like this idea . You should post it in the game ideas forum 
  - thank you i might just do that but due to the PIP issue in CRYENGINE i m going to refine it a bit first
- - I usually roll my eyes when people try to sneak children in here  but this is maximally cute

  - Maybe pre patch  I love it on my warlock .
- - I roll out an even number of sheets and fold the rectangle in half . It s very important that I get an even number
  - I was talking to my co worker and she said she gets an even number and folds each square on top of it s self .
  - That just makes a thick wad  one sheet in length  I like to have a bit of room for error when I wipe
  - Smart thinking . Have I been wiping wrong this hole time 
- - Forgot about them . Bonobos seem to be alright  actually . They re like chimpanzees  stoner cousins . I would nt classify them as dicks .

  - While I agree with your point  douchery and idiocy are not mutually exclusive conditions .

  - Funny  Not particularly . Useful  Absolutely .

  - That s what I m hoping for 
  - The portapotty ebola cancer pt thing or the backboard thing 
  - The latter . But the former sounds entertaining .
- - Anyone know where I can watch them  Living in the UK here  and I basically went to bed during the Trump vs MagicAmy match .

- - I tried using Shadowplay but for some reason it never recorded anything so I gave up .
  - It does nt work in Borderless window mode .
- - I m sorry someone called you a yuppie . They clearly meant weak-sauce hipster crybaby .
  - I would have been a tad more accepting of that .
- - Can jigglypuff edgeguard dk  Does her bair have enough disjoint or does she have to go in from above 
  - She can try trading or just follow him . He did neither and failed .
- - Took the screenshot myself yesterday  didnt know that it was already done from that spot Shouldve expected it tho
  - Honestly I think yours was better executed anyways .
- - I feel like it would probably look strange . I would suggest turning them into jean shorts

- - The Who - Live at Leeds The Kinks - One For The Road Wore both cassettes out on my Walkman ...
  - Hell yes Live at Leeds . It does nt get any better than A Quick One While Hes Away .
  - I like the rock n roll circus version . They made the stones look like shit that day  especially moon going nuts splashing water everywhere .
  - While the Leeds version is great  after seeing the rock n roll circus version  the last minute of the Leeds version seems tame .
- - I dunno  what does all the research you did tell you and why are you asking strangers on the internet for health and safety advice

- - I live in Milton . Where is this 
  - This was Dufferin Grove on Dufferin and College .
- - Clearly that s where his power switch is .
  - maybe he just faints ... because no one wants a sword over there
- - Genders are nt jerks  people are .
  - This is it ... I completely agree .
- - Everyone else in the world has such pretty currency ... America s is just gross .
  - Everyone else s currency looks like fake Monopoly money . If you want your money to be taken seriously like the dollar then quit putting pink and purple all over it
  - Why is pink or purple less serious than green 
  - I m pretty sure that he s a troll that s been booted several times from this sub in the last couple of days .
- - So ... Lifetime has a movie that subtly suggests abortion would have been the best option 
  - Everything was just peachy until delivery day so I do nt think abortion would have been a valid moral here .

  - Yeah upgrading brakes could really improve their stopping distance .
- - Do any ladies shave their mustaches with a straight  That would be pretty cool .
  - Do nt ever ask a lady about her mustache . You re asking for trouble there 
  - Especially when she s holding a straight razor .
  - She would have it coming if she was holding one of my blades .
- - Lived in the area my whole life and always got this question when in the FQ or other tourist areas . It s just an assumption .

- - It s everything . Rockets  grenades  bullets  mortar rounds  you name it it disappears if you die .
  - Bullets  seemingly not  due to the rampant kill trading  the others  probably . Still seems all around silly . c
- - I m gon na say either the jar behind the fan  or the little one atop the change jar . Third choice would be the cups on the right side .
  - Those are some good choices . That blue jar is airtight  so I definitely like that one .
- - Let me guess  they drew the prophet muhammad .
  - Nah  i think this time they drew Al Baghdadi . He s probably taboo as well .
