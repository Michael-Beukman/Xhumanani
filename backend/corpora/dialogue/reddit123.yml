  - But it does nt add enough punitive force to account for the trouble he could have gotten in .
- - Arrow  Nikita  Person of Interest  The Shield  Friday Night Lights  The West Wing and Luther
  - I ca nt second Luther enough . Also  Bojack Horseman

  - His contract ends on June  so he is still to define his future  but probably will not come back .

  - Should have been . Good job on cam for stopping it . If the defense holds here that could be a big play
- - On the subject  is anyone else disappointed that the most fun thing the Inquisitor could think of for Cole was lunch 
  - Well you are in Val Royeaux  technically you could do eating  drinking  whoring  and visiting the privy all in one trip

  - Surely that s a fault with the advertising maybe if they dropped the PC MASTER RACE bullshit people might take it more seriously .
- - yeah i meant to look into melatonin last time i was at walmart  someone told me it was not a script
  - You might be right  I think some people take it as a sleep aid so it might be over the counter  That s something to try  at least .

  - All the best with the move  and welcome to Adelaide 
- - I do nt know how they do it legally but a World Market near where I live sells them . I ve picked up a few .

- - The World Series ... has no one thought about this title
  - IKR  Why do nt we invite other countries  Japan and Mexico like baseball do nt they  Are we afraid someone else might wight win 
- - Happens to me at least once every time I have this bounty . Just go to orbit . Then go back . Simple .
  - It s easier and faster to just go to the Mothyards and come back  it usually puts you a different lobby .
- - Or you could print out little outfits for the real penis in your life ... Or costumes for boobs  like the glasses with the mustache face .
  - MY BOOBS NEED HATS  I could coordinate them like matching outfits for twins  THIS OPENS UP A WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES .

  - I like the Equinox too but I every one I have inquired about has been in some type of accident .
- - Yeah  but his opposition is going to call him a Socialist regardless - might as well get out in front of it  I suppose 
  - There s a big difference between the GOP calling you a socialist and calling yourself one .
- - Another good one  What s next - feels like a primary ; Vex  Suros 
  - I like Suros  Vex Mythoclast is also quite good because there is so much mystery around it .
  - The loop in the description is brilliant . I ve also used my second vex mythoclast as the exotic shard for my first one  just to add to the fire .

  - Not really . Its a difficult engineering problem certainly  but its one of the easier parts of getting a person to venus  and already largely solved
- - Are you sure that the stang is not dipped 
  - I guess it could be  but when you do nt take the effort to take the license plate off  I m assuming the worst
- - I do nt know if this is a solution  but Complete Crafting Overhaul Remade has an option in the MCM menu so that only the Dawngaurd have crossbows .
  - Where  I dont see that in the MCM

  - Ya lol it s like this on every single post about Rashida
- - Also a rumor going around his party was going to dump him on Monday  so decided to run to the polls to stop them .

- - You could have just gotten a new passport
  - Maybe he just likes the body cavity searches .

- - The Gasparilla Pirate Festival in Tampa  FL .
  - Best attended by boat if possible . The funny stuff you see is priceless .

- - Further context is provided if you check the other studies referenced in the paper  rather than just viewing their findings in isolation .
  - Does this further context include the full data set and a methodology that makes the distinction I asked for  If so  please link that information .
- - Check her out in the old movie Barbarella .
  - For every comment bashing Jane  they need to see Barbarella . Watching her roll around in that opening sequence makes everything else forgivable .
- - Im fine with it since thats what hm slaves are for . The only thing i dont like is how long the cutscene is when you proc eon flute .
  - I think that s actually a loading screen in disguise .
- - I ca nt imagine that channel staying popular for very long ...
  - It did okay  and still has quite a few followers . It could be because they had a lull after the Kotaku spike .
- - Hi - I m waiting for my flair to get updated  but I was told I have Pikachu in my Safari . Added you .
  - Yepp  you have electric type with emolga  galvantula and pikachu . Thanks a bunch  . D

  - I cracked a smile as well and it was smooth as eggs
- - If they keep hold of their current players  and Arsenal do nt sign anyone  I ca nt see why they should nt be able too .
  - Possible  but doubtful . Arsenal have been ravaged by injuries the first half of the season and are level with Saints .
- - I m not usually a belt girl  either  they make me feel constricted haha - but I love that one 
  - I have the same issues  This one s nice and stretchy  so I m comfortable . D
- - Looks pretty solid . You might be ignoring the lower lats along with hamstrings a bit  I d also add in dips and pull-ups and perhaps close grip bench .
  - What would you suggest I add for lower lats  They are already lagging behind a bit when compared to my upper back .
  - I believe yates rows are the go-to .
  - Thanks  I ll definitely give it a go
- - Well if it s a dirt floor you could try a spruce sapling and some grow lights .
  - While cool  I imagine that would be hell on the foundation in the long run .
- - Fabregas was shit after January every season for us .
  - To be fair it s not easy when you re in and out of the team like he was . Especially since he was nt always in his best position .
- - Stick it in your pocket with your keys . Do nt actually do that .
  - Been there . Done that . Ouch

- - It s not  only a concept by an artist .
  - Ah bummer  I think I m getting way too hyped for Ferrari and Mclaren next season

  - In terms of retail space  yes . The Mall of America is the largest in terms of area . I think .
- - I would nt . But sorry money can only buy so and so much from me .
  - It s not really buying  it s more like renting .
- - This applies to the face as well . If you force your skin to become too dry  it reacts by producing too much oil to compensate for the dryness .
  - Use moisturizer but how do you force your skin to be so dry 
- - Any issues with being on DECA test and eca while on or should I drop DECA before  I m planning on running DECA for a long time .
  - Nope . ECA helps with lethargy and appetite supression . Deca and test are fine  if anything they ll help you retain muscle during your deficit .
- - This is excellent . I have found my mistake point and how to fix it . Thanks so much 
  - I am curious  where was your mistake 
- - A quad is nt like a glider at all  nor is a wing  although a wing can maybe fly slowly
  - Just a suggestion . Quadcopters are small and easy to store and you can fly them almost anywhere . They are also good for fpv .
- - Same as Morgan from Boy Meets world for a few seasons .
  - And when she came back she said something about being in time-out for forever .
- - Suh stepping on Rodgers ankle was probably really an accident and his reputation is what got him in trouble .
  - The ref who saw it thought that in real time it was an accident  it only looks bad in slow motion
  - nobody seems to realize that EVERYTHING looks intentional and malicious in slow motion .
  - Yes  The Bush hit on Harvin in the playoffs last year got so much unwarranted attention .
- - cowboys really need to make some adjustments next half
  - Hmm . Good plan  good plan .
- - Who s your qb  What offense do you use  And what kinda passes do you use 
  - I m the QB  I use the New Orleans playbook  and I throw a lot of bullets but mix in lobs from time to time .
  - Haha I meant who s the player and what type of play  like lots of play action go deep for example
  - Like what are his overalls for pass deep  throw mid  etc .
- - Surprised to see Manning only has one .
  - Manning either has the game put away early in the playoffs  or he loses .
- - Edge needs to replace JBL and Lawler as the veteran color commentator on Raw .
  - Can he replace Lawler instead  JBL has his moments .

  - It s amazing with Ohio State has done with Cardale when I see the incompetence of Lindley
- - did AB look like he was jawing with Drose 
  - I think they were just talking about the play .
- - mate I m with you  donovan was terrible when he played quality competition .
  - Exactly . I thought I was alone on that .
- - The big question I would have is if there s fracking going on in the area as well .
  - no idea . theres a big shipping plant  and a dr pepper plant in the wake .
- - I call bullshit . There s no way this is going to be a real Razer product . It is nt covered with pointless LEDs .
  - Which is pretty ironic  as somebody could use them for head tracking . D
- - I recently got a Badger from an engram . Has increased stability  high caliber rounds  and third eye . It is a beast in pvp .
  - Mine has firefly . Love watching people go up in flames in crucible 
- - Whats a good place to do these surveys 
  - Valued opinions is reliable and pays cash or gift certificates . I can vouch for that one .
- - I love true crime stories  and this one really has everything - scandal  extramarital affairs  DNA - all in a suspicious mountain community in Italy
  - Excellent story  the kind that is so convoluted the reader has to go back to double check .
- - Imagine how much he cried when he cut it up .
  - Of course he did  it was his baby 
  - That and  you know  onions .
  - Of course . Btw  would he have to use a sword to cut it 
- - Are there any risks if you use Tor 
  - Unless your country explicitly prohibits the use or Tor  there are no risks . Tor is a just web browser that connects to the tor network .
- - Maybe you need to adjust your monitor 
  - I doubt it because Dota is the only game where this is a problem ...
- - I agree  much better without the mouth
  - How did you want me to send you the completed version 
- - Any ideas for protesting this  Petition  TIFO  chants 
  - Empty seat would probably send the loudest message . You know  more empty than they already were . No way is Red Bull getting a dime out of me
- - How did Fabregas end that match  dirty kick on Kane
  - I think that was Cahill not Fabregas .
- - Is this for real  or did someone just mix him giving advice into a song they wrote 
  - It s real . There s more songs on youtube that were a part of an actual album that he released
- - Looks great  I will shoot them a message as well . Thanks .
  - Note . they wo nt be cheap  but they will be great .
- - I d say famous  not infamous . There s no reason this portrait is famous for a a bad reason .
  - I do nt follow  I called it amazing .
- - I mean  it s an obvious scam . Why go through the steps 
  - I honestly almost fell for it till at the last second i realized I was about to trade all my good players for a bronze contract card ...
- - What is its purpose  Is it educational viz . revealing of production techniques 
  - Well why would you listen to a live version of a song or an outtake in the studio  Because it s a new take on a song we all love .
  - why listen to a percentage of a song tho i mean i understand isolated tracks but
  - There are a number of reasons but if you ca nt come up with them yourself then it s not really worth explaining .
- - Is it as massive as it looks  I could just imagine someone trying weed for the first time and getting way too stoned .
  - I do nt think this is their first joint  just the first legal one .
- - This GIF does nt do it justice . Needs to be in higher resolution and slowed down because damn that was quick . Thank you for showing this .
  - It s a vine  but a higher res gif would be awesome .
- - The military of the ESSR would be happy to assist their neighbors to the south in this conflict .
  - Thank you for the support  however  the conflict has died down . Micronesia submitted .
- - What about the witcher adventure game  I heard nothing but great things about it .
  - Really  I ve played the app and heard nothing but meh  things about it ; which I agree with .
- - Perhaps MAC Nightmoth or NYX Burgundy for the liner  and you could use the pencil to fill in your lips and add some gloss in the centre to create dimension .
  - I was looking at Nightmoth  but I ll check out the NYX since I can acquire it locally . Thank you 
- - That sounds like a great plan  Good luck
  - Thanks  I really hope changing the time of day will help . Good luck to you too 
- - Wait . I do nt understand . I m entirely confused on what you re saying .
  - I meant the original poster . They were saying after Hou yi . Sorry for the confusion
- - STOP HAVING FUN  IT ANNOYS ME  Great find OP
  - Nice to get some lighthearted drama with all the Islam posts today .
- - The second link in the article is wrong  it s a duplicate of the first link .
  - I ll have to fix that thank you .
- - Yeah  I know you said buying new parts does nt count but it sounds like a PSU failure to me . It happens . PSUs are finnicky in my experience .
  - I m going to swap the PSU for a spare tomorrow morning .
- - Broken link . The page does nt show the article ...
  - I had to go to the main WGN site and then click on the article .
- - It changes what he said because other tournaments do nt have players live streaming matches from their perspective .
  - he never said other tournaments do that  also u can watch player perspective live in dota tv right  just not commentary by them .
- - You honestly believe fusion rifles take no skill  I disagree .
  - Complainers mentality . It kills me a lot  therefore it obviously takes no skill . Logic has forsaken you here .
- - A lot of these Windies players are highly overrated
  - In the field they re worth every cent . With the bat and ball i think you re right .
- - Thank you . My soundcard is acting up so I did nt know if it was mentioned in the trailer or not .
  - I went to the wiki page after watching the trailer
- - How big are coyotes down there . They look nothing like wolves size wise lol .
  - It could have been an adolescent  a female  or just scrawny . Plus  its hard to judge size over long distances .
- - I despise cleaning out the sink drain food catcher . Soggy bits of who knows what makes me gag .
  - Does nt make me gag but it makes me cringe . I wash my hands afterwards .
- - yeah Elia Kazan is a great director . The screenplay is also one of my favorites . what other Brando movies have you seen 
  - I ve seen the wild one and the godfather movies that i can think of off the top of my head . maybe others but i ca nt remember
- - This was announced like two weeks ago  was nt it 
  - Yes  but never saw it hear  so decided to post .
- - Did you start this before the nerf 
  - After the nerf for sure  I started way after the elf city came out .
- - That ... looks like a very expensive fuck-up .
  - Yea no kidding ... those scaffolds are nt cheap 
- - Would you have sex with your clone 
  - This is a stupid  immature question . Of course he would .
- - take it out again and just push on the sides with ur thumb increasing the pressure till it locks in . how badly was the mobo bending 
  - It was bending quite a bit . There are nt any standoffs all that close to it to support the board  so it has a lot of leeway to snap ...
- - i guess her son finally forgot her damn coffee .
  - Yeah just the other day I saw her son give her coffee . She thanks him and sends him on his way . Thought it was pretty cute .
- - Umm  boyfriend  I thought you just mentioned having a husband above 
  - Newlyweds  sorry . I keep forgetting that we re actually married .
- - That sounds like a management problem ... ca nt hold employees accountable if the company is such shit they need a consultant .
  - And if you do nt mind my asking  I am actually curious what field you are in . You are obviously intelligent and honestly quite humorous .
- - I do nt get why people purposefully misinterpret questions like this . You know that OP was referring to the band of light created by the galactic plane .
  - I just wanted to offer a different perspective OP might have not realized .
- - There s also a reason Tibetan Buddhists are nt blowing themselves up in schools and beheading people .
  - I agree  but presumably Tibetan Muslims are nt doing those things much either .
- - So basically they could have done this whenever they wanted 
  - Well yes  except before they didnt want to  because money
- - That hurt my brain to watch . Please tell me he was joking  someone .
  - If you ve been to banff  you d know they were nt . Seriously  stay away from banff and go to smaller towns in the area for a better experience
- - Hey  ive been busy lately  but im online now if you d like me to still hatch your egg
  - wow  Fortunately  I m online now  Just give me a trade in game  Thank you very much 
- - Yes everyone knows it s the best Country ...
  - this graph just emphasizes how big our dick really is
- - That stache would look better with a beard .
  - I agree  I normally have a beard . The mustache survived about five minutes but I needed to share it for posterity .
- - Sh sh sh do nt worry . I wo nt REALLY do it .
  - I never really can know that though  can I 
- - Just got off work  do my eyes deceive me or did we really do that scoring run 
  - There is no magic here  good sir .
- - Nash never shot with anywhere near the volume of Curry and took nowhere near the amount of contested  off the dribble  difficult  long shots that Curry does .
  - So let me get this straight . you re criticizing Nash for facilitating his team s offense and having good shot selection  I concede .
- - i got bit by a boxer once on the hand . I would rather slam my hand in a car door than get bit by a dog again .
  - Hammer bite as in from a gun but yeah dog bites such because they almost always get infected
- - sorry my attraction to a drawing on a piece of paper and jacking off to said drawing in the privacy of my home concerns you
  - Actually I do nt care  If you notice this is my first comment on the subject . The instant cat fight in SRD was funny though . You do you .
- - Eva green should play wonder woman so she can be fully nude and have Henry cavil railing her in his super man costume
  - I m glad neither of these are happening then .
- - WTF  TIL this meme is called small talk seal . I thought it was awkward seal .
  - Yeah I m pretty sure it s awkward seal
- - I honestly see that ring everywhere . Tons of our alumni have them .
  - Really   I just saw it today lol
  - Pretty much exactly that ... But James Avery sells one that is identical just without letters I know my dad uses that instead of the alumni ring
  - I was going to get one of those  but not sure how it looks like . Thanks for replying .
- - I have nt heard anything from my sm about that . Where can I see that 
  - It s on the portal under documents  then promotional materials  then winter one . There should be a training page and then beverage recipe cards for it .
- - It s not cheaper to live around Denver .
  - No one said it had to be Denver . There s more to Colorado than Denver
- - hey  im not american based  but it looks like a good reference point . thanks .
  - No problem friend  I m sure you can find a local source or closer webstore to order from . Theres always ebay as well 
- - Find a way to die for when I get inevitably get sick of it  and then enjoy my time for as long as possible  knowing I have an out .
  - Wow ca nt believe someone beat me to this one .
- - what crazy shit is that in this case  exactly
  - How about any of those tweets in the video 
- - I wonder how much opposition there would be to requiring all ATM s in Vegas to have breathalyzers installed
  - They all would aquire a thick layer of dust .
- - No  I know you have nothing to do with that . I legitimately think that no one cares about this .
  - It was a joke like I d have something to confess in light of the recent drama .
- - And I though it was us Mericans that had the problem
  - I am pretty sure that is nt a daily meal  but a once a month indulgence kinda thing .
- - Is nt the pivot screw head supposed to be on the other side 
  - Yes  it is . I just kinda like it better this way . The other side turned a little different color .
- - OP  you have the best collection  but it looks like you missed out on the uranium glass karma race .
  - That s okay . I just never thought to post it before . They re a super cool little showcase in my tiny apartment .
- - Im a bit lost on that mate  how do you mean 
  - Sorry I was trying to be funny . I guess because I see him having the comedic presence of being funny without doing specific funny things .
- - not at the same time though  unfortunately
  - Yeh  she normally does nt stop to feed the ducks . It was weird
- - What is that icon pack  Looks legit .
  - Axis . It has mostly all of my icons except for a couple and if they do nt have it they still put it in a box which is nice .
- - It looks like the person is climbing into the dinosaur s vagina .
  - So really you d be the gynaecologist to the dinosaurs 
- - Wow screw this article . Edit . Relax  it was a joke .
  - Well  it is packer history . Those who do nt learn from history are doomed to repeat it .
- - Track suits  Is Oregon s band run by Eastern Europeans 
  - Nope  just Nike getting every last bit of marketing out of Oregon .
- - It s a joke in reference to Spacely going triple negative and Denial claiming a a glitch happened earlier in the tourney vs TK . Just making fun of the situation .
  - That s for the clarification because I m not watching right now
- - Thank you  two hours seems like a good length . I ll look into that one
  - It s more than two hours . But it s still pretty short . Fair warning  the entire game is very NSFW and H-scenes also abound .
  - thanks  guess I ll have to give it a miss
  - My bad  I knew there was a lot of gore  but I did nt know there was H-scenes in it .
- - You ca nt crash in your car in NYC this time of year . Go to Miami  I guess .
  - Cool thanks for the warning  I think I ll go south .
- - So literally no one that s in Australia or Britain will be able to shift properly 
  - Nope . All their arms fall off . Obviously joking  its just a matter of personal preference .
- - How much have you spent on the game 
  - I try not to keep track  but honestly a lot less than people might think 
- - Everyone knows Boston is used as a blanket term for the surrounding areas . Boston proper is a financial district .
  - I m gon na go out on a limb here and suggest that plenty of people probably did nt know that .
- - I personally thought this was the worst one by a long way . Only one I could nt finish
  - Same here . It s one of two Discworld novels that I read only once  second being Unseen Academicals .
- - I did nt know elon had so many solar city shares .
  - Well you d be able to see better if ...
- - Neither team really has much of a run game  except for Cam himself
  - J stew has lead the league over the last four games . Granted we played sub par teams though .
- - would you rather I come on as a dick to you 
  - Or would you rather get the come off my dick on you 
- - Even if our fates are predetermined  our intended purpose to love God and creation remains unchanged  no 
  - How can an atheists  intended purpose be to love something that he was predetermined not to believe in 
  - Some people s purpose could be to not fulfil their intended purpose . Except for that purpose .
  - And then get sent to hell for it .
- - It would be great as a Halloween theme .
  - Last year s Treehouse of Horror event was night time IIRC
- - The hijab is supposed to keep attention away from the women so men do not contemplate about her .
  - No . Hijab is not about men . It s about a womans relationship with God . Men are supposed to keep their own gaze in check .
- - To stop buying more shit and use what I have 
  - This  I get distracted by new and shiny toys way too easily .
- - Was nt arena s land mass randomly generated and nearly infinite  I feel like that d be be a bit taxing with the current graphics engines .
  - Its still possible  but not to the detail of modern games  so nobody does it .
- - red . stop . yellow . caution . the light is about the change . green . go .
  - Some countries also replace the yellow light by showing how many seconds it is until the green turns on .
- - has there been an upgrade for the Invective shotgun  It s my favorite .
  - Made me sad too . Best bet is to spam bounties and hope for the exotic bounty again . Worked for me  at least .

  - This is gon na be a playa yacht .
- - It s probably seem as glamorous for him and his family in his circle
  - He s a suspect  but there s no proof yet that he was directly involved in the shooting . He apparently has an alibi .
- - Would you like to play a game 
  - No but I d like to watch him be repeatedly sodomized by Allah .
- - Yeah  champ . You nailed it . If I have those around and I have a first-time smoker  and they want a Cuban  that s the one .
  - It is that good huh  I have heard nothing but praise for it .
  - It s one I m going to box split as soon as I have the money .
  - Do you already have everyone in for the box split 
  - Honestly  it wo nt be for a good while  so do nt sweat it . But I figure I ll make a post about it when we do .
  - Haha well that s good cause I ve effectively blown my cigar budget for a good while . I ll look out for it .
  - Ha ha  man  there is a lot of interest in these 
  - I m sorry if I ve swamped you  I accept all responsibility for any stress hahaha
  - There were a couple of others fellas who chimed in too . If you look at all the comments and not just our thread  you ll see who piped up .

  - Hell I m pretty sure mine come that way from the farm store .

- - Crackdown . I forgot how much fun this game is .
  - I bet you would like Saints Row IV .
- - You all are terrible supports if you need midas to stay online .
  - And you re completely ignorant if you think midas is bad . You ve clearly never watched a pro game .
  - Not once did I say midas was bad . I m just saying if you need midas to not fall off as support you are a terrible support .
  - Again  you re completely ignorant if you think that s true .
- - Thank you to whomever sent the lovely gift  Once I buy some plates I will put this into practice 
  - Oh hey that got there fast  You have one more thing headed your way
- - That was a long walk to the well  and the bucket ai nt very full .

  - It s a good thing Flacco has a receiver like Dez Bryant I guess .
- - wtf what is the purpose of chopping their ears   i hope the previous owner is in jail .
