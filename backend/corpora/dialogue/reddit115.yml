- - Aw  she s lovely  thank you 
  - Do nt tell her that she might get a big head . P

  - There are Turn based strategy games in it  but most are more traditional rpgs .

- - must be the worst feeling when you go for the tackle  and just get dragged along
  - It s a Gronk world and we re all just living in it .

- - Maybe it is a roundabout way of coming out of the closet .
  - Hehehe  did you see The Interview 
- - Wow  Smith needs to apologise to Watson for robbing him of a wicket 
  - Watson would have reviewed it  let s be honest .
- - They really recreated this island really well  I d like to see them do more maps like this
  - They even got arrested for taking pictures of military objects .

  - I always wondered was this actually made by the DRRR  team  or was it just some fans who made the site

  - Oh I was almost getting set off the entire movie but that one little thing just put me over the edge .
- - Should I watch voyager  Or that other newer series 
  - Voyager and TNG are not the same  but VOY is special too  watch it . It s worth it .
