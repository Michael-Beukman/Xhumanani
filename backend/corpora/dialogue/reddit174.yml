- - Haha  you re the best . Thanks  I was short on time and did nt get a chance to find the link . Great read all over again .
  - Yeah  the whole thing is a treasure .
- - I have news for you . Americans never really stopped calling them French Fries .
  - Wait  what did we call them besides french fries 
- - Fuck one  marry one  kill one  go 
  - Kill . me . I do nt want to be near that .
- - Is my TV volume that low or is the crowd that dead 
  - With the exception of Mizdow pops it seems to be dead .
- - Normally I can laugh pretty well at these . But this one  Poor puppy .
  - There is a perfectly good hard  cold floor for him to lay on .
- - I took it last night perfect score never owned a gun before just been to a range with friends and common sense
  - I figured if it was meant for the masses  it ca nt be that bad .
- - Ill just say I disagree . Sure soccer is played throughout the world but that does not make its most known player the most known person in the world .
  - What living person do you propose is more famous  Just curious .
- - Hawk Nelson was a HUGE part of my childhood  so I just wanted to say thank you  I absolutely love Letters to the President . Just pure pop punk .
  - Thanks  Letters was by far the best HN record in my opinion  Hope you like my new stuff 
- - I have a hard time seeing the Steelers get past the Patriots .
  - yeah  but at the same time i do nt see anybody else beating them except the broncos

- - Sure  i can do that if thats fine for you .
  - okey doke . I ll swing back in
- - Not all anorexics think they re fat .
  - Some one earlier in the thread explained this really really well . I personally never realized some of the actual motivations behind it .
- - I would sprinkle after cooking  the flavor is delicate
  - Thanks for the advice  this seems to be the consensus 
- - I d imagine that s probably really basic protocol that the terrorists would have been planning for anyway
  - Yes probably  but better safe than sorry . Thanks for the reply 
- - Hey my bf and I live in Pittsburgh too 
  - Awesome we should meetup sometime possibly  Inbox me 
- - What  It says she plays at Newman University ...
  - Crap thought I read ND . Even better now 
- - I m not a fan  but in some regards it s simply good business sense . Studies reliably show that companies with a diverse work force do better .
  - But somehow that diversity ca nt be achieved through women having the requisite skills or merit  but has to rely on unequal financial incentives 
  - Hum  Who s saying the woman hired would be less qualified  The standards can be the same with a different referral bonus .
  - If they re just as qualified  then their merits should speak for themselves instead of being overshadowed by an unequal financial incentive .
- - What kind of soil did you use 
  - It was just your standard potting soil . I think it was miracle grow .
- - This means that Marinelli wo nt want to go to Tampa right  please please please
  - Nah  he will want to reunite with Ballard and Toub in Chicago now that Emery is gone ... please 
- - They re still run by people . People can make choices . These people chose to screw their employees .
  - They re screwin  with the wrong people .
- - And this is not going to fall apart soon  because 
  - if it was made with them tiny thin blocks it would nt fall apart in the next century or so
- - I really hate this . A DDOS Is nt hacking . Its just bombarding a server with traffic . Security is nt really involved ...
  - Yeah but it s hard for those sites to get views when talking about DDoS . By calling it hacking they re able to attract more people uneducated about the topic .
- - That was nt me singing  now was it . You ve got the wrong man .
  - It s all that black and gold . Hell  with this flu I ve got  I m just glad I did nt mistake yall for Bruins fans .
- - I have two kids and they eat healthy because there s a shitlord in the house - no bribery necessary .
  - Good point . Still nice to see this kid s got willpower on his own though .
- - Nothing  Because I empty that thing regularly .
  - your civilization is doomed . or maybe nothing is everything we ve ever dreamed of
- - Lol . Why would I pay more for a bond when I can get it cheaper on the ge 
  - Cuz you re rich and want to help someone out . p
- - I m picturing the drawing Sera would make of that ...
  - I can also be Hulk  Mages are awesome 
- - Thank you  after switching it to new i found it .
  - What was the post  I missed it so I m curious owo
- - Is your modem also a router  This could make it conflict with your other router causing double NAT .
  - Yes it broadcasts its own WiFi signals too .
- - So are these any different than the Delta tanks that came out several months ago 
  - This is sub ohm and has cotton wick
- - Who the fuck is he to say what people want and do nt want 
  - He is reporting on a trend  not dictating taste  you idiot .
- - Jesus is the weight loss pills and diet and exercise are the medical treatment .
  - Cause Jesus he knows me  and he knows I m right .
- - On your belt . Low ride duty height . Drop legs are unnecessary .
  - I ve done more plowing of fields than anything with a drop leg .
- - Fucale has such terrific lower body moment  but man his rebound control is making me nervous .
  - Thinking the same  swallow that puck already and get the face off .
- - I just do it in a real car .
  - Early January in northern Michigan  just take a drive right now and you can do it full scale 
  - I do nt think you need to qualify with northern . It s pretty slick here in mid Michigan and I would guess it s not much different to the south .
  - Fair enough . I am currently in the big Winter Storm warning area  so all I see out my office window is white .
- - That s just his latest excuse  his channel has been barren for months now .
  - your computer shitting out on you is nt an excuse  . And god forbid someone with a wife and kid spends the holidays at home .
- - That could work  Dexter and Reid are definitely the two smartest people in their respective departments .
  - Yeah  I really like the idea of them being friends  or at least getting along  until  you know  they realize .
- - Thanks for confirmation . It looked way to similar to Lebanon film poster .
  - I think that photographer knew about that poster  because resemblance is striking .
- - You re extremely ignorant to the way the world works . Why is being bad at math OK 
  - To answer your question . Cause most likely you being bad at math wont affect other people .
- - I wonder if we will have everyone healthy at any point in the season ...
  - There was the one month to start the season . That s all you get
- - It s a great name if your a giant pink puffball
  - That swallows enemies whole like a cute little black hole  absorbing their very essence  and deploying same said essence to destroy your enemies . Cute  indeed .
- - Oh my god another clover user . I thought I was the only one .
  - I do nt understand how people can live without it . It pains me to use vanilla Windows Explorer .
- - I know what Corruption is  that was nt the cause . It was never cast .
  - Are you sure the history bar showed his entire previous turn  I wish you had taken a screenshot .
- - Man  Ever had your balls sucked too  THAT is painful
  - You kidding  That s something great there .
- - I made this one too  It s lovely  Worth the effort  I think .
  - Thank you  I enjoyed knitting it and just hope my cousin likes it 
- - New VP for Cyberpunk skin at least . That would be enough for me ...
  - Just add flanger . Flanger always works .
- - Joe s great at reading body language .
  - he knows when to give the girls what they want which is nightmares .
- - I just turned to the predators . At least we have a good hockey team .
  - I ve been a Preds fan for years and this is the best Preds team I ve ever watched haha .
- - dam  i guess ball do nt lie
  - Rasheed Wallace s bald spot tingled when you said that
- - Seems like a big gamble . What happens when all those countries default and China is stuck with billions in bad debt 
  - Not much different from the IMF loans to Ukraine  then .
- - Anyone watch the world Jr s today  That was the best game I ve seen in forever . Shitty calls but whatever . Morin played great too .
  - Yeah I m bummed . Was a good game and I am bummed Dangelo turned that puck over giving away an empty netter  otherwise had a good chance . Go USA
- - There might be life swimming around Europa . But otherwise  yeah  maybe not .
  - probably bacteria frozen in stasis on some comet ...
- - block builds need more investment on nodes and can end up with a little lower life
  - You always need an HP pool in HC as last ditch defense . Something always gets through and you can only die once .
- - It would be nice to see Nuke just look less like Source  like what Valve did to Train
  - I wan na see this with several maps
- - FYI I nuke all these threads because posting overpriced ebay and craigslist sales would overrun the place .
  - Okay ... Still gives a good laugh but nuke away .
- - Hey . Thanks for using my picture . Also . Fuck off .
  - Thank you for creating original content that this sub requires to stay alive and thrive 
  - All honesty  it s not that bad . I just got a gopro so I was screwing around with the app . I ve seen worse . But whatever
  - I kind of like it honestly . Should be a really not that shitty HDR sub .
- - The entire point was for this to be public in order to denounce his son from being in the gang .
  - this thread is literally chalked full with people that are so ignorant on this subject  but so desperate to have their opinion read .
- - SOTA s Nightmares of Lovecraft . I would have loved to have added a few more Elder gods to my collection ...
  - Ya that would be pretty cool to have .
- - Do nt read the comments  what a shit show .
  - Do nt tell me what to do . I read every single one of them .
- - I m curious  what do you think farmers do to deer who eat their crops 
  - I am certain that farmers do not have deer derby slaughters to protect crops that deer might eat .
- - The real issue is that NA has the same number of slots as EU .
  - With over double the amount of qualifier teams  another European team should definitely be able to get an invitation .
- - He was in the infantry and was allergic to grass  no idea how he made it through basic .
  - Wow . Seems like the type of thing that would keep him out of the military
- - Wrong link or am I missing it in side bar 
  - Fixed  OMG I m so sorry . game is underway now .
- - ay how stretchy are the pants  nice fit
  - Thanks bro . The waistband is pretty stretchy and that makes em really comfortable .
- - you re right it s also cool we have guys in rap saying it s not cool to be in a gang .
  - We also have Kool and the Gang .
- - Well alcohol is pretty physiologically toxic and the withdrawals from it can kill you . Especially liquor .
  - But it can be used more often than MDMA without causing issues . Also why especially liquor 
- - RIP Western burbs  probably wo nt even rain here on the east .
  - We got nothing up here in Essendon .
- - idk dude my back still hurts from carrying you on the pi rats
  - did u hear that  that s the sound of my back breaking trying to carry both of u

- - Shut up bourne . Take the cookies and run
  - I do like cookies . Cookies are good .
- - I freaking love Mistral . I just wanted to say that .
  - Such a fun boss  and a good character too . Glad we saw more of her in the Blade Wolf DLC .
- - Well just chances are to get picked up by a decent  serious  team you need to have some skills yourself
  - This . It s best for him to look for a casual one for now for more experience  and then try out for more competitive style teams .
- - Game of thrones  gundam wing . Spartacus - I think they had it at one time  but took it off .
  - I think it s unlikely to see Game of Thrones  or any HBO series  on Netflix since HBO has their own streaming service .
- - You lost  suck it it up bitch
  - Act like you ve been here before ...
- - The site is barely updated . It s crazy how little they add every year . It s pretty disappointing .
  - Their hands are tied legally . FDA got on their case for health claims . Best to just get the data from them and look to third parties for analysis .
- - It s funny how you can always manage to find ways to attempt to justify your obvious racism . Have a nice day .
  - It s not racist to discuss race .

- - This helps thanks man  do you hear foot steps well in game play 
  - Yeah sounds in minor frequencies are picked up really well . All sounds are crisp and clear .
- - My brother just bought a pair that light up ... are they really that expensive 
  - They have knock offs and remakes but original nike air mags cost alot
- - Exactly . Like when John Garrett ruined Lu s shutout that time .
  - I remember screaming at the tv that night ... as a former goalie he definitely should have known better .
- - One was from Jen and she states that she talked to Adnan . THe other is unknown .
  - She testified in court that the phone was answered by an unknown older male individual . One with a deep voice  not like a child .
- - Just drag an item from your bank to outside the bank GUI  you ll get the option to destroy said item .
  - Even doing it that way you still get that message telling you not to litter .
- - as a nomadic faction  occupy the far left bottom settlement without having another settlement
  - And the far right  far left up  far right down . The Four Corners of the World .
- - Oh wow I had no idea those did that . That s really cool  Question  how does that affect the value

- - Oh  sorry  never meant to insinuate that ... I just love the general attitude of this sub is all .
  - Yeah  this is a pretty great place .
- - What is the guy running behind the camera guy doing 
  - I believe he is pulling focus for the cameraman .
- - I think you shall be in charge of modern media machine or political wars . You have a talent .
  - No talent . Just critical thinking skills .
- - Satan for the lil black one  because it looks like it s gon na unleash hell on anyone who messes with it . Leo for the grey 
  - The black one really is a little devil too .
- - Looks really shiny  nice looking car you ve got there .
  - Yeah its been raining here a ton and I detailed it for a car meet so I figured why not bring out the camera 
- - Why is it a mental disorder rather than a physical disorder 
  - Because there is nothing wrong with their body . Just their brain .
- - Alright thank you  Do the Blizzaks last long time  I m going to be dropping a lot of money on this I just hope they last a long time .
  - So far better tread life than my factory tires . This is their third season and still lots of life left .

  - nah i know plenty of girls that think it s gross as hell . Besides you got ta figure most girls are more thorough cleaning up front
- - Bring the powder in a ziploc and mix with water .
  - That might work  Or I guess I could keep it in the blender bottle and fill up water at work 
- - Damn  that seems pretty irresponsible of them . What kinds of hobbies do you have 
  - Exercising but that might be more of a compulsion . I love to write . I really like reading and watching movies . I also like looking at thinspo o Tumblr .
  - What kinds of things do you write 
  - stream of consciousness ; poetry about how i feel ; stories based off of my life
- - With all these teasing and shit you d think Alex Garfield joined the team as manager .
  - Too busy rolling in the pool of cash Twitch paid out for GGA .
- - Not taking the piss  do Everton fans here want Martinez sacked and if so  who d they replace him with 
  - He s a good young coach . This rough stretch hurts but he needs time to get out of it . Plus the goal has always been to win the Europa .
- - Yea I heard some stories about them coming with bad panels or dead pixels . Really hoping its a good one . Thought about doing RMA 
  - From what I ve heard the process is a nightmare and you are more than likely to get back either the same or a different broken panel .
- - You do nt need motivation . You need discipline
  - Why would I discipline myself if I was nt motivated to do so 
- - Could you explain what gave it away 
  - The zipper is easily seen . Bape shark hoodies are designed to have a small flap that goes over the zipper . Also the print on the hood is off .
- - Well and unless it s a truck I do nt see how I could get down far enough to even do that .
  - You have to do a crabwalk and just kinda ...
- - Give it a shot . It completely changed my approach to Warlock .
  - Still working on leveling up the subclasses  so I ll be using it eventually .
- - Babies are useless  hairless  vulnerable cats .
  - Well  that s more or less true .
- - I kept noticing faces in the background . Knowing Vsauce  I have to wonder if that was intentional for some silly reason .
  - Faces  I did nt see any faces ...
- - Wow that is also a very nice flashlight . I really like the red light and the dual switches 
  - Yeah  the UI seems pretty good . It has easy access to moonlight mode  high mode and the red light . Also  the flashing modes are nicely hidden .
- - I did nt know Tyrone was a French name .
  - It must be an abbreviation for the chocolate .
- - People moaning about the price . Is it really that much across a month . Just drink one less pint a month or something . Jeez
  - Do nt worry  they ll all buy it anyway and just grumble about it like proper British citizens 
- - Then Walmart puts them out of business and the economy becomes more efficient .
  - Normally I would agree  but they are being put out of business because of poor government policy and that is nt efficiency
- - Do you know the name of the widget  Most widgets seem to work with most of the widget tweaks .
  - Sorry  I meant to ask to find the entire widget itself .
- - I m not going to mention that there are a LOT more teachers than there are priests .
  - Um ... You just did . LOL . But seriously  it s a lot easier keeping your child out of church than out of school .
- - Who s gon na buy a pill that makes you blind 
  - We ll let marketing worry about that .
