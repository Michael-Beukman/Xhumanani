  - Complacency isnt the answer . Stuff him in the back of the van

  - Intel is also against net neutrality . This is just another nail in the coffin .
- - This is in reference to when ISIS threatened to attack Canada  not one crazy guy shooting up a building
  - But this act is more comparable to the Ottawa shooting . Individuals acting with violence rather than a terrorist organization threatening a country . The meme does nt really work .
- - Trigger warnings are fucking hilarious because it s so fucking pathetic . Sjws are nothing but attention seeking and pretty much hunt around just to be offended . Fuck them .
  - I mean  you probably do  but you understand that triggers and being triggered is a real thing right

- - And what about those Abilities that neither the Boff trainer nor the skilltree offers  Those you can only find on Boffs 
  - Those are the ones that you craft .
- - The problem is that the other items just are nt good . Sadly  riot balances by making everything weaker instead of making weak things stronger
  - chilling smite needs a some reward for using it on jungle mobs or you cant gank  the AoE needs to be on poachers not trailblazer
- - That s a good strategy . Thanks 
  - Pandora s Star is slow to start  which can be expected because it s looong  but it s definitely worth it  one of my favorites

- - You re totally right and it sucks . I bet wotc would make way more money if they were nt doing the money grub route .
  - Oh  I do nt know about that . I think they re doing just fine .
  - I did nt say anything about them not doing well . Doing just fine does nt mean a business model can not be improved .
  - Well  I m not sure that business model would be acceptable to the Hasbro shareholders .
- - Coasties do nt get enough credit  imho .
  - It is true  we do nt . We are okay with that though . You guys keep doing what you do  and so will we .

  - that s not it at all  they ve always been PvP focused in terms of events
- - We are the glorious PC Master Race that stand in order under the guidance of Lord Gaben to keep this world free of the dirty console gaming pheasants .
  - A pheasant is a bird  I think you mean peasant lol .
- - How d it look IRL by the way 
  - At first glance I thought it was an XF Jag . Looks lovely .
- - yo you should credit the dude who made the faces .
  - Yeah  but i cant find him  I saw it on twitter  but it was nt the original creator Wish I could
- - How many players did you sell to get that much money 
  - The only notable play I sold was ibra because he demanded a transfer . I also bought aguero . I traded cavani for benzema
- - Nice  so what else is new 
  - That s all I got for now . I slept great last night due to xanax haha
- - Oh no  It s possible to steal or lose money  I guess that makes money worthless .
  - Yeah  people do nt actually constantly lose massive amounts of money because someone entered a wrong adress in the computer . At least not without it being reversible .
- - Doing the same  also I got my plex media server up and running enjoying some good tv .
  - Yep I m running out of links to click on  time to fire up the ol  Netflix . Is it just you where you re working 
- - So we need guns to protect ourselves from the military that will not fire on us 
  - No  just the small group that will and then to protect ourselves from a tyrannical government  have you forgotten your history so quickly 
- - The Tombstone . For the last few years it s been kicked out of half the times it s been used .
  - Because he does nt leave his feet anymore with it .
- - On loan at Man City next season ...
  - Exactly what I thought . Midfield with Lampard and Gerrard .
- - Wow  that is the definition of patience  Looks beautiful 
  - Lol  that s why i only did one nail  Thanks .
- - Dodged a bullet there . He probably would have told you it was yours .
  - You should ve had a maternity test done anyway  just to be sure .
- - Cowboys  let s not wait til one sec is left on the play clock and actually make the defense guess the snap count
  - Lol  didnt notice  good call 
- - What vegetables do you enjoy  Could you make a low-carb diet change 
  - You re gon na laugh  I do nt even know what a carb is .
- - I love HBA  albeit their designs are a bit in your face . Nice pickups .
  - Yeah  they are kinda loud lol Thanks 
- - lol  but not the common ground . there is a difference  and it is important .
  - Surely they are both in the common ground 
- - My beers are empty and it s too cold to get out of the hot tub . Send help . Also hahaha at learn Kessel getting stuffed .
  - I m trying to lob my beers over but I do nt think my arm is that good .
- - Wow you know way too much about this .
  - I started cheerleading when I was in first grade and my mom was a cheerleading coach ... You learn what you re surrounded by . Haha
- - My girlfriend and I went to a Blackhawks game recently and had a blast . We re going to try for a bulls game for my birthday next week .
  - Excellent  Good luck and glad you had a great time .
- - I mean ... i do nt want to tell you your business ... but she does nt not sound like a clever woman .
  - She must be very pretty . Or give good head once a year .
  - HeadOn  apply directly to the forehead .
  - HeadOn  apply directly to the forehead .
- - I got enough food . Maybe I could feed the prisoners the meat ... what the fuck did I just say 
  - Butcher one and feed him to his friends . My prisons are usually nice but rigged so that I cab daily torture the ones that gave me trouble .
- - Are we allowed custom specials in this vote  If not  the miis certainly deserve bottom tier
  - Serious question  have you ever seen high level mii play 
- - What about the fuel used to transport beef and other food ingredients 
  - They re transported in bulk . There would probably be a very slight increase in fuel consumption  but it would nt be statistically significant .
- - Any music with voice is very bad for concentration .
  - Yup . I feel like that too . Hence i listen to mostly instrumental music when im studying .
- - Thought it was strange that the spawns did nt trigger last night - guess it s not just me .
  - Well good  I m glad it s not just me either
- - But they are wound on a steel core .
  - I misunderstood  I thought you meant steel strings were nt ever wound
- - No offense or anything ... but that looks really grainy and low quality .
  - Original is round end screen  difficult to accentuate the colors without bringing out the blur as well .
- - I ve saved most of them . Does anyone know of a cool way to display them 
  - I ve always wanted to mount them into a movie poster frame
- - I personally think Hideaway Bar on Orange and Virginia has killer wings .
  - Ahh that s right down the street from my job  I ve gone there one time  but never ate there . Adding it to the list 
- - That s all they could get out of her voice after editing  Still sounds like crap .
  - Thats what I was thinking . Can you imagine the raw vocal without the autotune
- - Rolled up seaweed with fish in it . Do nt know why but it feels like it would taste delicious .
  - Tried fish with rice  and also tried seaweed with rice . They were both pretty ok so I d say it d taste fine
- - Ahh thought so . I use my carbon copy in conjunction with my Timeline most of the time so the Carbon Copy adds the space a reverb would add .
  - It really seems that the Carbon Copy is nt entirely necessary when you have the Timeline  but a thickening agent is good to have around . . thu .
- - Nice video . Aerobatics in the least agile fighter is quite a sight . . P
  - That s what I said  but Chris insisted 
- - Is this a reference to whats happening at the end of March or did you not see it
  - Did nt see it  just watching Futurama and this popped in my head lol
- - Someone did a really good writeup on why the stormcloaks are the worst choice and now I always go imperial
  - I ll take your word for it . It s like no matter how much I dislike imperial  I hate the storm cloaks more .
- - I ve missed sarcasm too many times .
  - Where is it  I will catch it for you .
- - I was that guy for the multiple camps I frequented ... All the Minnesota fam will know me 
  - Southern mn represent  Ha hope to run into you .
- - Reading this comment made me want to play through OOT again .
  - Do it  I swear you wo nt regret it  I m at the fire temple now 
- - Truth is Dr.Boom is not a good card . The Boom Bots are good tokens . P
  - That are summoned by Boom ... Thereby making him a good card .
- - Pro tip . hit the gym . Strength training will help you lose fat much faster and will help tremendously with work and general endurance .
  - Yeah  Is strength training possible without a gym and a lack of home equipment 
- - Those are pretty much face value . Your best bet is always Stubhub or Craigslist .
  - It s also a pens game so tickets will be more pricey than normal
- - that  my friend  is an amazing comeback
  - Been to long do nt feel like actually looking but thanks it s cause I m the greatest
- - MUST BE TOUGH HAVING NO TEAM LEFT TO ROOT FOR
  - WE LL SEE YOU NEXT YEAR IN THE SUPER BOWL
  - DID THE GIANTS ALREADY GET TICKETS TO SEE THE GAME NEXT YEAR 
  - I M SORRY  CAN YOU SPEAK UP  THE RINGS WE TOOK FROM YOU ARE IN MY EARS
- - Wow nice  Are there gon na be freebies  Of course theres gon na be freebies  Please save me some freebies .
  - Haha  I do nt know yet  but I probably will know tomorrow 
- - Try PNG  but steam always does this ...
  - Yes  I have created an habit of saving as a.png because somehow the steam engine works better with it .
- - So baked you went down on a piece of glass
  - I just laughed once I did it since I realized how high I was . I love those moments
- - Do nt forget she was in a Van Wilder movie too  I found this out after some light imgur lurking ...
  - also in the movie . Her tits . Spectacular .
- - Maybe I played a game with similar graphics that did say the line 
  - The only similar games I know of would be Earthbound or a fan game bases off of Earthbound .
- - Anyone else think Gruden might be digging into the nose candy  He s got some serious facial ticks and jaw clenching going on . More than usual .
  - Hes legitimately grinding his teeth with intensity for the game . Football is his cocaine
- - Would you get diffusal against a Wraith King  or is it still not enough mana drain to stop his ulti 
  - It could perhaps be viable against him .
- - Sullinger lookin fat as hell . Just saying . Has he always been that big 
  - yeah  it s weird cause he s not that fat  just seems so on TV . H does always look like that for some reason
  - It s that big booty . He does nt have a big gut or anything . The booty makes him look extra fat .
  - He s got that Dejuan Blair booty .
- - You have Way of Life right  If so you need to be focusing on Theology to go on pilgrimages now .
  - Okay thank you  I had no idea why one of my rulers could go a pilgrimage but all the others I played as could nt .
- - So the Trinity are super rares . Sad sauce .
  - I m fine with that . It keeps the Chases in sync . There s a theme to them .
- - The which tastes better argument always makes me think of the Popular People s Front scene from Life of Brian .
  - It s not a matter of merely the taste . People rarely comment on the texture .
- - People seem to be surprised that we have an offense ... we have been fine now that Cam is completely healthy again .
  - It also make it easier when you start every drive at midfield or better .
- - Do you bake the ingredients into the bread  I ve never seen such a creation
  - You hollow out a large loaf  layer in the the pre-cooked ingredients  then compress the whole thing . It basically makes a savoury cake 
- - Went to Joann crafts and got really pretty boxes in all sizes . I group by color and stack the boxes in my big trunk .
  - That is actually a really good idea  I have room for boxes . I am debating on going with boxes or a plastic set of drawers
  - The plastic drawers are a bad idea . Not only do they fall apart fast  the weight makes it hard to open the drawers below the top one .
  - I did nt think of that  maybe I ll look into boxes and sort by brand or color .
- - I think that takes the prize for the most inappropriate comment I ve read here which is an impressive accolade indeed . Well done .
  - Yes . It s the worst one I ve seen yet 
- - Cool  I ve seen OP s video posted here several times but I ve never seen this version . Very cool to see his follow up
  - I  too  have never seen the back side of this story .
- - Thanks . I finally decided to read the screenplay yesterday  but I was having a hard time finding it . Perfect timing .
  - Haha  I m in exactly the same boat  Was wondering why there was only a black screen .
- - Whenever i watch hentai porn . That shit is fucked up .
  - Depends on the hentai to be honest with you . Some is pretty decent  some is fucked up . But I will always prefer it to real porn .
- - Both his sportsmanship and taste in attractive German fans are impeccable .
  - you can just call them German Fans . the rest is redundant .
- - Sure  let s just propose methods of control over everything we do nt like then and pretend like there s no analog to government there . That s cool .
  - Governments kill and destroy things they do nt like . Down voting a meme and taking away imaginary internet points is nt nearly as bad IMO but interesting analogy
- - In what world do you live where that s potato quality 
  - I know  it s at least mushroom quality .
- - Thanks  but I ve just been cutting and pasting the same note everyday .
  - Lol  we can tell when you do that . Catch some funny mistakes that way . The drop down boxes make for some humorous mistakes as well .
- - Oh god . A one hour Hell video .
  - I liked it . Better than the longer sim vids in my opinion .
- - Hey  do nt skip ahead just yet . I love your wild speculations  gives me something to think about each time .
  - I m sticking with one episode a day  no worries . I m enjoying this too .
- - i m pretty good  but i get picked on a lot so im underrated .
  - I just wan na let you know that whenever I pick on you its outta love bby . Also I need to grab my shovel because you are so underrated .
- - I do nt think they need to do the memory thing . Just making an assassin movie would feel like more of a contained story
  - They could just act like its a film made by abstergo  have the logo in the beginning like its an actual producer  etc ...
- - Good idea . Also  try not to lick the red wire .
  - looks like low voltage garden lighting so you can lick it if you want .
- - most difficult gun to get in the game  Cmon man it s cool but do nt lie . it has a bounty for it ffs
  - An RNG bounty  and then you have to work for the gun after that . The only guns other than exotic bounties that are difficult to get are raid weapons
- - The cardinals were not winning that game in any stadium .
  - Unless Palmer runs out of the tunnel after halftime with a new ACL  no .
- - By laying the tax bill onto everyone else 
  - Nope  just cancelling all the planned work on roads
- - Comments like this are such salty BS made by people who do nt do shit . They come up in every comment section where someone talented at something displays their craft .
  - Thanks for defending me  My work has graduated from being called pretentious to Kitsch . I guess trite is the next level XD
- - If healthcare is a right  it needs to be in the constitution  not your employee contract .
  - Privacy is a right and it is nt in the constitution .
- - G-rated until the last three words . Fucking close .
  - I forgot to edit that out EDIT . done
- - its a complicated question that cant be answered easily . in some areas we ve made progress  in some areas we ve stagnated  and in others we ve horribly regressed
  - That comment is so general that it s meaningless .
- - Companies shunning themselves ... must be Amish . ; D
  - Uh duh . I meant to say community . Can I blame autocorrect 
- - I understood it perfectly  I was taking the piss out of how bad the dialogue and characterisation were . Good visuals and good actors ca nt save a stinker .
  - Correct . Nolan has a tin ear for dialogue and ca nt plot his way across a table .
- - How do I check if the reaction wheel is disabled  I tried right clicking in the VAB and there is nt an option for that .
  - The command pod has the reaction wheels . You should be able to right click it to disable them in both the VAB and during flight .
- - Bang is really dope . I love that synth you used . Nice work
  - thanks haha means a lot  . D
- - Nice  where did you take it 
  - From my living room window on Interstate  plus zoom
- - That you have no money to pack personal bowls for your friends 
  - I stay packing bowls  I was just taught how to share .
- - Yep  it s really annoying . But you know  it s a beta  ...
  - well it is a beta . not a full game . it wont have everything done
- - jack mentions it on several occasions as he is apparently a fan .
  - Huh . Never took much note  apparently . TIL
- - Whenever someone says omg sick stand in ez rip skinz  the stand in does shit
  - Olofm stand in for VP . . P
- - That is amazing . Is it an addition to an existing stack  or the start of a new one 
  - This is an addition . Shitty pics of the full stack are below the first picture .
- - Oh  cool  Gon na try at a comedy club  or somewhere with a little less pressure 
  - No idea  I ve got a whole year to procrastinate .
- - Funny thing is  the scumbag player can still revive less than a minute before extraction  get his reward and get out .
  - On the other hand  you ll have definitive proof they were lying and freeloading . You could easily report them then .
- - Hold your breath while standing on your head and drinking a glass of water  then hold that position until someone comes along and scares the hiccups out of you .
  - Verified . Once the screaming stopped  I noticed my hiccups were gone 
- - That s stupid . At least with rape  one person enjoys it . No one wins with a veggie Chipotle .
  - Animals win with a veggie burrito . Those cute little  fluffy  juicy animals .
  - Animals do not win because their food sources are being taken away by damn vegetarians . An insect burrito would be the most helpful to animals .
  - How would being eaten be helpful to insects 
- - This asshole is why I got a faster car than my Mercury Sable ... Here  it s typically some douche in a shitty riced out Honda .
  - Around Detroit the assholes all prefer to drive Chargers  never fails .
- - This midfield looks so wide open . I m surprised united have been losing the ball as often as they have
  - That s because we re playing too safe  which translates to being too slow  not creating spaces and everyone s closed down .
- - I do nt think the French police get as much trigger time as our boys in blue do here in the States .
  - How do you get less than zero 
- - Unless OP lives here like us there is a good chance he missed it .
  - touche ... I really should go work on boxes .
- - That video was incredibly awkward to watch .
  - I ... personally feel ... it made it the ... complete opposite .
- - Now I am gon na see the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon everywhere . That  my friend  is known as irony .
  - No  it would be irony if you now never heard about the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon again .
- - The oil from the pipeline is for export . It does not provide oil to the US market and as a result does not improve security .
  - Source please  Just trying to understand how you came to that conclusion . My impression it was bound for refineries .
- - It s cool to buy it and load your Paypal Card  but you may run into issues depending on how you choose to unload those funds .
  - Should I get the Paypal debit card and withdraw as cash then deposit into my bank account 
- - I m just stating damage does not equal a weapons potential .
  - and he never said it did  he said it has low damage  and it does .
- - Is Dion looking to involve the teammates this much because he just got here and wants to make new friends 
  - No this is what he normally does . He just also throws up stupid shots
- - I had no idea they were even released . Does the tush tag say who the manufacturer is 
  - Oh nevermind  I am an idiot .
- - wife or not  atleast he knows he can cop a blowjob from you now .
  - im not saying im gay  but a gats a gat
- - I have great results with squatting every day .
  - You are deloading every so often and throwing in light days right 
- - Chavs give pitbulls bad names . Like said when trained and socialized  they are great dogs .
  - I wish we had chavs here . They seem so kooky .
- - I tried to text your number but it s a landline . I kinda want to call you but im nervous
  - If you do  tell me what it is .
  - That makes sense . I always just thought you had huge fucking balls
  - Hey  man  that is a medical condition and I ll thank you not to stare .
- - They ought to make them move to Milwaukee or a bigger city .
  - They should make the Rams move to ... um ... wait  nevermind .
- - Without the shrubs in the back  could pass for Mars .
  - Or clouds ... But yeah  totally came here to say this
- - Action looks good . Probably wait to rent it though .
  - If the action looks good go see it in the theater . Support films you think look good .
- - Do you have a SD card in your phone  If so  unmount it and try installing again .
  - Thank you  I have been getting this error when installing hitman go and this worked flawlessly to fix it 
- - And you had a nightmare right  right 
  - no just got done doing some ranked and was just thinking of a champion .
- - I just rode the red and green lines more than I am comfortable thinking about .
  - Live in Oak Park so im familiar with the west side of the city .
- - Does it stop when you play a game 
  - Louder when playing a game or watching TV . Muted the TV during this clip .
- - Blacks were the only victims of the North American slave trade  or that the US was the only country practicing it .
  - Or that it only occurred in north America
- - Great job and all  but an invisible layer is covering the search box .
  - fixed  knew I would forget something . Cheers
- - can I keep the mew  it isnt clone  right 
  - Sure  And yeah it is nt cloned .
- - Love it  There should be a sub for tiny Kerbal creations . Btw  you forgot to open one solar panel on the left .
  - I know  but I noticed too late 
- - Original packaging or just the keyboard  If you could include a few pics in a pm that would be nice .
  - Original packaging as well as the original aluminum WASD replacement key caps . I ll send you some pics in a little bit .
- - Sure  but then would nt it be kind of awkward to spend the whole time talking about Coach K while sitting in the Yum  Center 
  - I doubt ESPN would consider that when deciding where to do GameDay .
- - I remember you guys  Great job 
  - Really  Haha  awesome . Were you in costume 
- - I m excited for seeing a roadmap .
  - I ve grown nervous these past few weeks with them not saying anything . I m hoping they focus on core gameplay rather than chasing some other half thought out features .
  - They also released a game . And with the holidays right after I m sure they took a break .
  - I did notice the game release . Still it surprised me that they did nt have anything ready to show consumers to deter conjecture .
- - It just would nt be the same without him as Richard Gilmore . It s like when they replaced Dumbledore in the middle of the Harry Potter movies .
  - To be fair it was only after two movies .
- - step sister does it confirmed creepy as fuck
  - Do you guys put something over her eye  Eyes that do nt close get super dry and easily get infected and can scar their eyes pretty badly .
- - I feel that some women just go to hook up but they do nt want to seem too desperate about it .
  - That s definitely a big part of it . I think the hard to get part is another aspect .
- - Wow . That sucks . Sorry you have had to go through all that . What is your favorite meal 
  - Yeah it does suck  haha . Hmm  I d have to say my favorite meal is probably a Portillo s chicken sandwich with fries and a cake shake 
- - Not really - games with multiplayer mode have something for customer that pirates usually ca nt offer . But in single player only games  that s completely true .
  - many games have working multiplayer for pirates too
- - These sound like all work conversations ... please tell me you work at ge
  - I m with you . All but the coloring book are textbook GE 
- - And people call South Australia a horrible place to live ...
  - the outpouring of community support has been amazing to see . and recovery is going to be a huge task .
- - Late night  Some of us call that normal morning .
  - Righto . Standard waking time for me on work days .
- - Whoa ... there s still CDs for sale 
  - Not just CDs  fuckin Huey Lewis and the News CDs .
- - Honestly  I would just rather wait for Thrive . If it accomplishes even some of its goals  it would be way better than the ideas in the linked post .
  - Thanks for your support . It means a lot to see people all over looking forward to Thrive .
- - Those kind of look like something I d stick in my vagina for fun .
  - BRB  got ta check something ... EDIT . -
- - Did you take a picture of your tv 
  - No I was standing on top of the camera guy .
- - It s a video of him explaining to new players .
  - When I posted this  there was nothing besides the topic .
  - It s not a self-post  it s a link .
  - It s okay  it was just an accident . Everybody makes mistake .
- - What do u think about the discussion between Catholics and Protestants about Being or Person  Whenever I think of stuff like what u posted I ca nt help but wonder .
  - I m not sure I understand your question . Could you expand a bit 
- - Hearthstone is one of the best tcg on android at the moment if you re looking for something competitive .
  - Ah  I should have mentioned I have that one . I m playing on a kindle and for now the game is unplayable for me .
- - Oh cool  maybe this year I ll actually watch some replay of it on youtube  haha
  - Are you into Katy Perry  She s doing the show this year .
- - That s awesome man  I wish I had family that smoked and was that open to toking with me . I m jealous . Have fun 
  - Thanks man  I thought she was going to be weird about it . But she was totally cool with it .
- - In the frequently asked questions section of the Legend of the Poro King page they said that the icon is the same one from last year .
  - ohh well ... weird but thanks for the answer .
- - You can also try retailers that specialize in carpets . They almost always have some remnants for sale . Another option is used carpet . Check with local installers .
  - Good idea  ive never thought remnants would be so big  so that s what I had nt previously looked this route .
- - Those things are nt sealed off before they re dropped  They just continue to spill jet fuel 
  - Yes  there is still some residue fuel . Not dangerous really .
  - I feel like it d be more dangerous to drop a few gallons of fuel in a sealed container but maybe that s just because of video game physics where everything explodes
  - Well  for starters  those pods clearly are nt red . Should be therefore save to shoot em .
- - Would a better comparison be to Shakespeare s histories  in that they were based on actual historical events  but some of the details have been exaggerated for dramatic impact 
  - The only thing about Shakespeare is that I ve read Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet  so I am afraid I have absolutely nothing to say about him .
- - All things considered  it is important and quite necessary to get married  since we both want kids .
  - Forgive me but why is it necessary to be married to have kids 
- - Hmm  so I could have just shorted and exercised to close  Too late now ... Thanks much for the good advice  though .
  - Who knows ... maybe you would ve just cannibalized additional gains . Good luck tomorrow .
- - I think they are going to need a bigger house soon lol
  - Luckily planning on expanding soon  They ll most definitely need it 
- - Roca is fucking nuts . Its about time he gets a team worthy of his skill .
  - Roca is the soul of american CS  a walking aimbot frag video
- - Err is also sometimes used in place of Error .
  - yeah  it could be that but i was interesting in it so that s why I looked it up
- - this is exactly my nightmare and hence never own an in-ear headphones
  - I honestly had never thought of it ...
- - What did he say  ; - ;
  - He said he felt bad but he would nt give it away free
- - The Mythoclast is a raid weapon . And for the one millionth time  Xur does not deal with Raid weapons .
  - Its also an exotic  which he does deal with
- - Too bad those post-op tits are so ridiculous .
  - Ridiculously awesome . Do nt tell me you would nt play with them if she put them in your hands .
- - i mean  they do nt really have to try as hard as they do  so what s the point 
  - My guess is they just enjoy being assholes and will use any excuse to be assholes .
- - Who knows which shop sells mechanical keyboard in lowyat 
  - Almost all of the big shops in Lowyat will have them . They are not hard to find .
- - The problem with your post is that you are making a moral statement about irresponsibility and human decency . On what basis and on who s authority do you make these 
  - Dude he s Phyrexian ... so probably Elesh Norn .
- - Thats what always made me wonder the deep sound if it went away since the mass was nt there to make it resonate .
  - i guess i ll find out one day 
- - The idea of giving users karma on their cake day  I mean why would anyone do that .
  - Seriously  It s like  you already have cake next to your name  what else do you want 
- - It s called system tray  But tabbing out is even more inconvenient I d say  not everyone has a second monitor
  - True  it s really inconvenient to do that but the good thing is you can talk that way during the loading screen .
- - People really do nt use the search I guess
  - What is the issue then . I searched high and low .
- - How is Cerberus these days  I left there in January last year because the server was basically dead . Did the population and raiding scene pick back up again 
  - I started playing back in June and I ca nt say it s inactive at all .
- - Should also make a post about how you took a picture of your screen instead of a screenshot .
  - Go for it  plus i was on my computer and didnt think about just using mobile
- - That third slice of pizza . ugh .
  - that third slice ...  do you even lift 
- - it seems wrong to everyone in Australia too 
  - How curious . Surely you ve spent your entire lives having Christmas in the summer  so would nt it seem ... Normal 
- - We still suck  nothing has changed .
  - Well Carr has that quick development trait .
- - People still buy digital codes in store  Oh  boy ... let me tell you about price inflation ...
  - Yes  plus there s no tax on the cards so ... Yea lol
- - Please include NA or EU in the header next time so people know if they ll be able to join . NA is not the center of the world .
  - Well  it is every time I look at a map ...
  - A map that has to cut a piece off a continent to centralise another is not the best reference .
  - We do nt have to . We destroy other continents by choice .
- - Yeah . If there s still junk on your junk you re not showering right .
  - You should nt use normal soap on your genitals  though . It will lead to worse smells than just using water .
  - Why is that  Like I can see upsetting the PH for women  but for a man skin is skin is nt it 
  - The tip of the penis is also very sensitive  that s why men are born with a protective layer of skin over it .
- - From what I m learning . It s really just preference . No wrong answer .
  - Yes . My current preference is that the guy would reply because my anxiety is making minced meat out of me .
- - Down US East coast . Does anyone still have it 
  - None of my friends and I have it here in RI
- - To you maybe  you ball size queen 
  - Ball size is far  far too underrated .
- - I have the hoodie . I got it off of fanatics
  - Do you have a link  I tried searching through their webpage and could nt find it .
- - What s the point of faking leaks  Seems like a huge waste of time to me .
  - It s subjective  typing up your comment could be seen as a waste of time too . Or playing video games  or doing anything .
- - Drink every time they mention the SEC during the Sugar Bowl
  - I like drink anytime the sec is mentioned in the rose bowl better . You re gon na kill yourself doing that in the sugar bowl
- - I bought the new beats ones from the Lebron commercial  they re alright .
