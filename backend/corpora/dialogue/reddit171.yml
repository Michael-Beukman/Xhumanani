  - Oh  Yeah . Lemon on salads  So much flavour  So good 
- - Infinite supply of raccoons  It does nt get any more specific than that . He retired the fuck out of that gif in my opinion .
  - They created their own context though  which is not allowed . Had someone else said they had an infinite supply it might be different .
- - is that all the current set of models they use for their cosplay 
  - Nope . I believe these are all random girls because the cosplayers did nt want to do nudes
- - what the fuck is this mcdonalds commercial

- - Cousins looks completely disinterested . Nobody is playing to win .
  - totally disagree . They ve been working hard all night  but they ca nt find a rhythm
- - That makes me feel a lot better . Math is absolutely my weakest and English is not difficult for me at all . Thank you 
  - I was the same way . Just make sure you study fractions and other basic stuff .
- - So I m just making sure that this show is nt worth watching  Edit . Thanks for the feedback  I m watching it now .
  - I enjoyed it but I was nt anywhere near what I expected to hoped would happen . What I least wanted to happen happened . OST is still amazing .
- - Oh sweet child . Make sure you hold back dogs tails as well . Many a Golden has lost a few hairs to a dremel in the grooming salonS

- - Well the next logical step is for it to play itself .
  - read the article . it did . a lot . in fact that s exactly how it was developed
- - Considering that Syriza does nt want to leave the Euro I ca nt understand Merkel s obsession to create an exit mechanism in the Euro .
  - The problem is that Syriza does nt want to follow existing laws and treaties .

  - Does everything stop being interesting after a year 
- - So meta . Lmao . I hope this issue tightens the writing up .
  - What s not tight about the writing  I have nt had any trouble understanding the content so far .
- - Not everyone wants to me a giant immobile mass of link that just eats and lifts  many of us have fitness goals more interesting than mass cultivation
  - This is a completely inaccurate assumption . Lifting by itself increases flexibility . Think about it . It takes your joints through a full ROM under a weighted load .
- - Comment to change mine  fuckers . EDIT . If I m a mod  how would I go about getting back my red flair text 
  - For flair . Red flair text  To answer your question  I have no idea .

- - My Dad passed away finally from a very  very long battle with Cancer .
  - I m so sorry . I m sure he s finally resting and happy .

  - Good point . Maybe his poor sense of direction will actually counteract their powers .
- - Yes  it was a limited edition  therefore it was limited .
  - It was as limited as the GameCube in general . Everyone had one .

  - You sure that s why you drive a monster truck 
- - I rarely ever watch anything other than the PL  but it seems everytime I watch La Liga or Bundesliga football  it s so much more exciting and entertaining .

  - Unfortunately not . I hate doing Recipe For Disaster  did it once  never again .

  - Yeah . That would be weird . Who does that  right  Right guys  ... Guys

  - If he improves then Shannahan  until then Nonis .
- - I d grab it . Was nt there supposed to be an Xmas comic book this year 
  - Yeah  I think they took the ideas they had for the comic and they are gon na be part of the claymation movie .
- - The Archer class would like to have a word with you .
  - Meanwhile Assassin sits alone in the corner and cries .
  - I actually like Stay Night assassin . Zero was boring and sucked
  - Are you talking about Sasaki or spoiler 
- - She is like the popular kids  shes like super hot 
  - Dude  cmon  just ask her out . It ll work out .
- - Because she cheated then moved as a fuck you to the dad acting to immature to be able to raise a kid .
  - It s so interesting that you have personally talked to the woman in this story and know her reasons for everything she did .
- - I have not used extension ladders enough to know what s wrong here . Can someone explain 
  - We have it leaning against the ceiling . The ceiling is vaulted  or angled  one slip and it slams forward to the floor .
- - Bama just has no answer for Cardale . No pressure  no tackling  no coverage  nothing . Crazy .
  - Had him rattled in the first . Just have to do it again .
- - Last time this did nt even last a whole game  right  Here s hoping this time has a similar outcome .
  - As a Vrbata owner I m hoping so .
- - Does nt being a Christian require you to believe the Bible is the literal word of God 
  - As Carl Sagan would say  science seems to me like ... Informed worship .

  - What do you mean Zelda  I m talking about the picture in the post .
- - What the  Why  Is that a GPU on top 
  - Yes  ontop of the motherboard  The thing on the roof is a radiator for cooling the CPU
- - To be fair most people are calling him out
  - When I commented  it was the top comment .
- - I feel like this is a scene out of Ren and Stimpy  and I mean that as a sincere  sincere compliment 
  - This is my favorite comment in a while .
- - Best piece of practical advice I ve heard in along time . Enjoy this gold .
  - I thank you for him . I made me feel good  that this thread generated such a great comment and gold
- - That s fine by me  he has to do what he has to do to get by . It hurts his credibility on other issues  though .
  - No way man  I trust him more . He SEES the aliens .
- - Just remember  some things ca nt be unheard .
  - Yeah  learned that the hard way .
- - You have a point . They just do nt want to hear it  unfortunately .
  - main reason i stopped coming on here frequently lol
- - What does that exactly mean  Like what exactly would this hypothetical bank of Bitcoin do 
  - A bitcoin central bank does nt even make any sense . The whole idea behind bitcoin is that it s decentralised .
- - It s too late  But yah I kept talking and it would repeat all dialogue and no keys would allow me to exit or move around haha
  - Press Enter to pick the dialogue you want to say .
- - The charging station actually saves you space . Two controllers placed vertically on it  take less area than one controller laying down horizontally .
  - No it does nt because the controllers charge in my hand when I play games .
- - Based on what stats from smash ladder  Win rate  Popularity  Some combination 
  - I m not too sure  but I think it s based on both popularity and win percentage . I ll probably ask anther about it eventually

  - I am sure they did . However  they did nt try to hide that fact like they did Kurt s use of a powered amplifier .
- - Did you seriously have to do that storyline to figure out Rasputin was in that bunker 
  - Ca nt say I ever knew that bunker was there before I played the storyline .
- - im talking about evo only . pm was never at evo
  - Pm was a side event last year . This year we ll be lucky for even melee to have that same status .
- - Should I reXurbish my suros regime . I feel that I would primarily use it in PvP only so it would nt matter if it gets maxed out
  - It would be useful if you are interested in the iron banner
- - I d like to see this picture recreated in ten years
  - Mountains of money on the right . Shitty kids on the left .
- - Hmm ... I only see two putters . Are the rest of them out of frame 
  - Nope just the two . That one really works for me so I bought two lol
- - And the people in charge of enforcing this law act with common sense 
  - Exactly . The state is saying they can do it better than the mom while jailing the mom and denying her medical care  That s a WTF .
- - Yet wiping with their hands or leaves in considered cleaner . I just do nt understand Indian people sometimes .
  - they think raping people is okay  its a shithole
- - That would have been cool to have Moss and Carter on our team .
  - I think you re thinking of Cris Carter . He s definitely not coming back . Duron is his slow  lazy  and immature son .
  - I take it he does nt even play football anymore 
  - He was cut by the Redskins before the season began
- - show me a WoW player built like that and i ll buy a pair myself and post photos .
  - Yeah  because gamers that play WoW certainly ca nt be fit .
- - I Gotcha  yeah that s a tricky situation .
  - Yeah  but I geuss whinning about it doesnt do me any good . I just need to brighten up sometimes
- - Forced to not die of cancer . Holy fuck the agony

  - Yes it is  We are full though  my apologies
- - I can tell you why without reading that article ... it s because feschuk is an idiot .
  - One of the media members that make sure no player wants to come to Toronto .
- - I know it was a hypothetical situation but for anyone new you should rarely try to shift que ravage . Not unless you re tping or something .
  - I think you re looking for the word rhetorical
- - Glitter s a type of herpes if you ask me .
  - Having just finished panto  can confirm I still have glitter in places I ca nt mention .
- - Dragon are awesome  I ve got a model dragon egg and skull here from a Kickstarter I funded .
  - My dad used to get crystal dragons every month that held orbs . I used to love them so much .
- - Not at all  as much as I hate it  happy to be back .
  - I m hoping that s how I ll feel in the morning .

  - While the person might not be charged with a crime  that wo nt stop private parties from seeking damages in civil suits .
- - As in nothing at all happens when you turn it on  Does the PSU fan start 
  - Yes PSU fan does turn on actually . That motherboard has an led display and a power and reset button and the LEDs do nt turn on
- - Just fuck already you two  damn .
  - Only if Kobe sits in the corner frowning and shaking his head with disapproval the whole time  muttering about how people did nt have sex like this in his day .

  - my thoughts exactly . I am more worried about bone exposure
- - Would nt MGTOWs be the one s who just do nt bother with playing in the stock market 
  - Not necessarily  MGTOWs still engage in RP principles and some still have plates . They do nt entirely opt out .
- - Do Github pages support custom fonts or jquery  I ca nt get either of those to work .
  - There should nt be any issue with that . What s the code you re trying to use 
- - I want to sleep so badly . . c
  - Same here . I really need to go back to bed and just sleep the rest of the day .
  - Thanks  I m kind of nervous  but I think I ll be okay . It s a phone interview  which adds another dynamic to it .
  - I ve found that phone interviews are a lot easier . But then again  I m always on the phone haha .
  - Yeah  same  I should be asleep soon  though . I ll try at least .
  - Same here . I will be getting ready for bed eventually .
- - Ive always felt very meh with these guys . I dont hate their stuff  but i would never put it on willingly
  - TIL there s someone that does nt like The Price of Existence
  - I like awaken the dreamers much better . p
  - Probably because it s amazing from start to finish . I do nt think I ll ever hear another deathcore album I like half as much .
- - Probably a stupid question but how would we know that it was destroyed if we ca nt see it 
  - The light from the supernova travels a lot faster than the shockwave . The light from the shockwave hit us before the pressure wave hit the pillars .
- - Try Chengdu in the Sichuan Province . I miss it so much .
  - Even the word Sichuan makes my mouth water . D
- - Is that an orange slice  Should be a watermelon .
  - Was nt an option . But niggers love them their orange crush .

- - No  no menthol for asthma attacks  Menthol is very irritating and can make it worse
  - Oops  my mistake  I m just thinking of whatever it is that clears airways in vicks  I m probably completely wrong  thank you for correcting me 
- - salvia is something else . Do you plan on doing it again 
  - I feel satisfied enough to not want to go and buy it anymore but  I do plan on buying another gram sometime so I can experience a full on breakthrough 
- - I m sure I m biased because I was there  but Teddy s first start .
  - Ending a great game on a blocked punt safety was my highlight of the year I think  Teddy was great in that game too .
- - I d take anything Mike Silver says about the Raiders with a mountain of salt .
  - Dunno  he s been pretty on the ball thus far .
- - In the future  if we had the technology to fix  a prisoners brain so they do nt have any more criminal motivations . Would you be for it 
  - It doesnt work that way you moron .
- - I tried . The door is bolted .
  - OSHA states it must remain unlocked in case of an emergency fire  natural disaster or other emergencies
- - I do nt think you understand the free speech concept . You can say what you want  but you re held accountable for it . You can be prosecuted .
  - You do realize they used to grease bullets with pig lard 
- - That s pretty neat  but I have to ask why you stood around looking at it instead of jamming your fist up its ass .
  - Why use a fist when you can use a spear 
- - Watched it pretty high with all my friends and we laughed . Sounds like you were determined not to like it so you could sound cool .

  - Daughter s one of my favourite bands  and hearing this song made me love them more . Wanted to share .
- - Munich is nt really Germany  but Bavaria  They are a bit different down there and in no way representative of Germany . Always choose Berlin over Munich .
  - Berlin is also not representative of Germany . No one place is representative of any country that s bigger than Liechtenstein .
- - Beautiful  Also I see your friend peeing .
  - haha I did not even see that until now 
- - Because tolerance is overrated  fuck everyone that is nt exactly like me .
  - No  because it is cheating and against the terms of service of the game and you can be banned for it .
- - Zebcos are great for beginners or fishing where you can lose or break a rod easily . I personally like zebcos for cat fishing and such .

  - If you honestly think Cormier is trash you are incredibly stupid .
- - Right  but wearing a seatbelt and locking my door do nt have the added risk of potential matricide .
  - Look at it this way . wearing a seat belt will increase your odds of surviving an accident but does nothing to prevent you driving like a dumbass .
