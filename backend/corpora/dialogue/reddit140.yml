  - this tweak works much better than activator . it would just be nice if there were a timeout option built-in

  - Dammit if Andy Dalton can do it  we Cam .
- - Now make or work with timezones  DST  and relativistic effects for computers travelling near the speed of light .

- - You re retarded . They do nt kill for religion . That s their cover . They re animals . They kill for political power .
  - Which political group was advanced by this 
- - That s because Darius is a lane bully . Irelia is nt as item dependant as poppy for example tho
  - She is more reliant on when she gets her item .
- - Cops probably wo nt do anything  especially if you have nt actually seen anyone do anything .
  - You do nt have to see anyone do anything . You can call if you see a suspicious person and the cops will drive through the area to check .
- - What about a skateboard or a surfboard 
  - Just moving an entire building with you .
- - You need to set a buyout price bud
  - Oh crap  Thanks for telling me  sorry 
- - I have have never seen  I found it funny .

  - Really  Wow that sucks  I guess it s also not helping that I ve run out of antidepressants haha  Roll on monday 
- - Wall of Thorns is far from impenetrable . Are you sure you are playing the game correctly 
  - Almost certain we are not . But that doesnt stop the fact that we cant figure out what we are doing wrong that we cant bypass it .
- - I hope the cameras help you get to the bottom of this and that you keep us all up to date . Good luck 
  - Thank you so  so much . Your support means the world to me and I do nt know how I would be coping otherwise .
- - Has Beckham in his name . Which makes me want to draft him .
  - He also has Green in his name . Based off his name  I do nt think you can go wrong .
- - Regardless of the outcome  the Cards D is still fantastic .
  - Feel bad for them man they got fucked all game by special team and offense .
- - I see he took the Warthog approach to design . Take one awesome thing and build around it .
  - What a fantastic phrase  saving that one 
- - This is still not idiot proof  you can throw something into it by accident .
  - But you can pick it up because there is no lava
- - I think you get some wizards in an early-game tutorial . He may have kept them from that .
  - This is exactly what happened . When I did my second account I knew I did nt need to use them all so I saved them for later attacks .
- - This looks like something out of unhinged or unglued .
  - Well it does have the silver borders .
- - the movement is more SLDL to squat than just dropping your hips - some people call it a king deadlift
  - That s actually a really good way to describe them .
- - I too have that copy of The Hobbit . My wife calls it our Kyle Gas edition .
  - Now that you mention it  the resemblance is uncanny  Just like how Frodo s piece in the board game looks like Jerry Seinfeld .
- - Brodeur retire plz . Be our new coach
  - He ll retire and work for Jersey . It s pretty much known .
- - Is it just me or was the lettering kinda hard to read  It s just so pressed together that I kept getting lost on the middle word bubbles .
  - I agree . It seems like the letters themselves are kinda wide  and the spaces are small  especially between lines .
- - While I also like opening my toys  for Nintendo the package is marketing and for collectors it s art
  - I think more people would be happy if they attended a few sessions of unbox therapy .
  - Or maybe you can let people do what they want with their toys  You are nt a better person for opening your box . To each their own .
  - If you do nt open the box  you ca nt really do anything with the amiibo  so what s the point other than a collectible for your shelf 
  - Besides the point you just gave  it makes me happy . I enjoy them in their boxes
  - I guess that ... actually makes sense . Go on then

- - Yeah  someone else found it awhile back too . But now we know Dan likes explosions and spying on people .
  - And that he s a excellent shot apparently .
- - Dat Owen Daniels slip on the right of the endzone . Heinz field s grass turf strikes again .
  - Their field is terrible . It happens to both teams so that should be an indicator that something needs to change .
- - lol ok . I m still going to hate people though  I do nt really need an excuse
  - I said the same thing when this happen last time people suck .
- - Time out so Pero can practice his FT form .
  - I bet he spent the whole time out at the line shooting an invisible ball
- - You can do the same thing with the roots of scallions  leave about an inch and put water in a shot glass every day
  - I ve been doing this for a couple years ... I always have fresh green onions at the ready because they just keep on regrowing 
- - Never understood the banners of the elephants with skeletons on their back . it puzzled me all weekend .
  - I always took it as a sign of the return of Bassnectar . I ca nt explain my reasoning .
- - I m pretty sure thats exactly what happens .
  - It s not  because if that were the case we would all be of one ethnicity .
- - Greetings from Sydney  Up the Rockets 
  - Hi from Melbourne  You guys getting rained on up there as well 
- - on the playground is where I spent most of my days
  - Chillin out  maxin  relaxin  all cool and all shootin some b-ball outside of the school .

  - You beat me to it  Definately Pulp Fiction .

- - I m sure we all know which band wo nt be releasing an album this year Edit . it was jari  I was referring to jari
  - Dio  I m going with Dio .
- - Should nt SF be revealed during the channel or is that just a very long cast animation that wo nt reveal him 
  - His ult has a special interaction with shadow blade . He will be revealed just half a second before it actually goes off . The rest is just cast time .
- - This . Weird question - but is her physique improving and has she always preferred to go to the gym so late 
  - Yeah her physique is getting better . But the reason it s later is because he works during the day .
- - Right  Fallon . Always get the two mixed up .
  - I hope they told her to take some blood pressure medicine .
- - Well I main Annie and imo syndra is pretty good . Ahri is hard because she cant survive the combo .
  - I was talking about champions that can deal with syndra with the lb and ahri bit  not the ones that can be good against annie . Should ve clarified .
- - That would make a really cool rug .
  - Yeah  I bet it would really tie a room together .
- - Gnar and Azir have them though  maybe RekSai and Kalistas will be in a future patch .
  - Maybe  what is left unanswered then is to why they have nt patched some of the new taunts 
- - Damn  I almost want to buy one  Ah  curse my poor student life .
  - i dont think you could if you wanted to . they are probably not available online or in any retail store . i d buy one for shits and giggles
- - He s not intentionally implying that  but it s why the two British presenters are corpsing at the suggestion .
  - I do nt think it is  I think it s the fact that it was such a loud and sudden outburst more than anything .
- - Well thank you guys for destroying my comment karma and lifting up my link .
  - Your comments reminded me of dad jokes .
- - Hawaii and Alaska would get screwed under two time zones . Maybe two for the continental US .
  - And Guam . I m pretty sure it s just for the continental .
- - Serious question . would it make sense to load both alternating between FMJ and HP for your home clip
  - I m curious about this too  but I m using Alien Blue so I ca nt even see if someone has replied to you .
- - Loud how  Like ... coffee maker loud  Moreso 
  - I d say it s like a very loud coffee maker .
- - There s a petition to make a law for her . That s more of a difference than she was able to make when she was alive .

- - I m not gon na miss hearing that song
  - Seriously . It just ... gets to you . Think it s the pitch fluctuation and trailing  I dunno  it s just annoying D .
- - I have never been more noided in my entire life
  - i was more noided during the nldw cataclysm but this comes close
- - Blaming everyone else  always a good pocket strategy .
  - I ... you ... when it s out of your control there s nothing you can do  that s the point of stating that something is out of your control .
- - They only gather in the Blue Palace if you join the stormcloaks . If you join the imperials  they gather in the palace in Windhelm .
  - I wish I did nt join the Stormcloacks . Jarl Balgruuf is my favorite Jarl .
- - I always read these in Phone Guy s voice .
  - Then you are reading it in Scott s voice .
- - Such is the way of things . Caron would probably score more in Edmonton as well  by virtue of getting more TOI .
  - Yeah but we did nt trade Tyler Seguin for Jordan Caron .
- - Thanks man . I ll try and bring the hype a bit more . Get some more energy in ma blood .
  - Drink a slab of Red Bull before casting for best effect .

  - It s time to move near a Rack with better stuff .

  - Nope  it only lasts a week .
- - They put that in the patch notes ...
  - Is nt it nuts how some players do nt remember every single note mentioned in a large patch 
  - That s because it is nt in the patch notes . A lot of people seem to say it is  but nobody has linked it yet .
  - No kidding . I actually looked after you said this and it s nowhere to be found .
- - The TEAL bottle SCALES up damage the faster you are moving
  - I think that s pushing it a little .
  - it was . A MOTHERFUCKING . joke .
  - gamzee dont you have cherubs to abuse 
- - What s in it  I ca nt imagine what they d sell there other than standard survival tools .
  - Probably Walking Dead merch  Just a wild guess ...
- - Roasts Stumptown ...  Stumptown roasts Stumptown .
  - Brews  Can I still blame NYE 
- - yeah  for sure  he s looked great tonight  but I just meant his focus needs to shift a little bit while Terry s on the bench .
  - He has a double double and is carrying us right now .
  - yeah he s killing it . nice to see him playing smarter .
  - I hope he can keep it up .
- - Registration stickers go on both plates . At least in my state .
  - Hell  we do nt even have registration stickers on our plates in Texas ; they go on our windshield .
  - And they re going to combine registration and inspection
  - Really  That ll free up so much space on my windshield for activities 
- - Where is the recycler part . All I see is some little glass stand holding up a sherlock
  - the little orange curve that connects to the stem from the top of the bowl
- - As a mechanic I do nt know how people pay for the upkeep on their own cars . I would literally be shit up a creek without my skills .
  - It s difficult for me to diagnose technical problems . I can change parts and administer general maintenance  but tracing a source is another story .
- - Huh  I was just talking about straight radiation exposure not the origin of cancer .
  - Oh  I misunderstood you . Yes  you are correct .
- - The regular LOreal Voluminous is reaaaally good for volume  It s a lot more wet than the Butterfly IMO .

- - Your English is good  I love you French people 
  - he s not french just a massive reposter  idk who the op is .
- - The Barcelona offense with Messi  Suarez and Neymar looks insane on paper but has yet to perform ...
  - That s because Suarez is unstable and Neymar simply is nt that good .
- - What the hell she missed some spots .
  - Make up is expensive Shitlord and she ca nt afford to cover all of her skin
- - Yep  Bingo looks good . Is it supposed to speed up as it gets closer to the end  It s hard to keep up with it even .
  - I believe it suppose to be like that .
- - you are a gentlemen and jacket jedi . i m going to read this thoroughly good sir  thank you .
  - No problem . Let me know if you have any questions about any of the specific jackets I listed  or need help finding alternatives .
- - Hijab fetish simply does nt make any sense to me . When a Muslim girl is having sex in real life  she would most likely not be wearing her hijab .
  - Because porn is always an accurate rendition of real life sex
- - Just because the cat is born in a stable doesnt make it a horse .
  - Cat s urine glows under a black light .
- - It is a good thing that I can afford admission to a museum . Jesus ...
  - I believe congratulations are in order  Now  may I offer you a cookie

- - Not a very wise decision to buy a puppy while intoxicated .
  - Not wise but it helps getting over ex s 
- - I m pretty sure I ve dated about two different versions of you . Except a little less on the dog part .
  - We re uncommon  but not really rare . If you re lucky you get a special foil one .
- - Well the Gigabyte one is longer so make sure it fits in your case . Honestly  I would go with the one that matched my mobo s color scheme better .
  - Will be an issue with a ATX board and a Mid tower case  I think it should fit . I have nt selected a case yet .
- - lol raises ram price after sees peoples interest
  - Laws of economics are quite funny  I agree .
- - Mine works pretty well . Pulled a few picks with him last night with countless swats and ball separating hits . He s cash money .
  - Either he s not really doing anything or I m always playing smart opponents that rarely through the ball his way .
- - That was the cheesiest commercial ever . Fuck off McDonalds
  - I feel bad for the Packers and Bears fans hahaha
- - I do nt eat anything  and when I feel like I m about to faint I eat a cheese cube .
  - I m just one stomach flu away from my goal weight .
- - Do you sometimes  when it s a slow day and there are nt many customers  just  like  grab a movie and watch it or something 
  - I watched The Secret Life of Walter Mitty five times that way . Battleship . Lone Ranger . Jack the Giant Slayer . There are a lot of slow days .
  - Was Battleship as bad as I ve heard 
  - I love that movie ... It s a great movie but a terrible film .
- - And they could eat carrot crops  It would be interesting .
  - they already eat fully grown carrot crops in the game . its so annoying when they eat half my carrot farm .
- - The SMPL switch fits in the hex mod 
  - Also  this is the Hex mod from fasttech  not the original . Would never patina an authentic .
- - Aeon Flux was a terrible  terrible movie .
  - I had a realy good nap in the theater for that one .
- - Forget dips for now or you ll wreck your sternum like I did  by not being able to keep proper form in your shoulders .
  - Yes bases on the comments here I ve deducted that I need to follow progressions better and not jump the gun .
- - Funimation has the license  chances are they wait until it s dubbed .
  - Unless we start a letter writing campaign 
- - Of course  please do nt tell me that this elaborate ruse was not needed and that all I had to do was ask
  - lol well that depends . do you realize that I m a man 
  - Really  And here I thought the hairy arms and legs was just your way of showing you are a feminist
  - hahaha hey  you d be surprised how many people think I m a woman .
- - Why do we still care about consoles sold  It s not like it s going anywhere .
  - That is nt particularly true . If Xbox One does nt sell well there is no next Xbox .
  - No matter what the sales numbers say  xbox has a big enough following for them to warrant another xbox .
  - We do nt know that at this junction of the generation .
- - It fits . Actually wish it was a size larger .
  - any more info  Accessories  Shoes  Colors at least  I ll get this .
- - A handshake happens first  so the password is encrypted before it is sent for authentication .
  - Ah  okay . Thanks for the info

  - There will probably be no dev talk . SWC is more important now .
- - Where the fuck did you get those pictures from  What are they made for 
  - It s best not to ask too many questions  OP might have to disappear you .
- - In most states  you can get paid for unused vacation  but not necessarily for unused sick leave  if they re separate benefits .
  - Yep . I m getting let go this month and I get my vacation time  but no sick leave .
- - I enjoy it  but not a fan of the exhaust pipe wrap . Does nt seem to blend in well with the rest of the bike .
  - And it s a PITA to maintain  rusts out your pipes incredibly fast and gives no noticeable benefit .
- - Huh I did nt even know this song existed
  - You can listen to it on the spoofy
- - Give me her number and I will ask her for you .
  - I will actually take you up on that 
- - As a counter argument  why should nt you be punished for being unable to kill the opponent 
  - Also  I m already being punished for not being able to kill the opponent BECAUSE THE OPPONENT IS STILL ALIVE .
- - Its either medical condition low  or end of TRT cycle low . Either way something is screwed up .
  - My money is in end of cycle .
- - Those of us that still have pride in our country are still proud of you guys . Do nt let anyone try and take that from you .
  - And I can honestly say we appreciate it more that you ll ever know .
- - Is there a link to the list 
  - Ca nt find one yet EDIT . Somebody found one 
- - Was nt he handcuffed like crazy on that  his very fist studio picture 
  - And I think he came on pretty late in the production if I remember correctly .
- - Really cool . Why did nt you go to Berlin  It s pretty much the place to be for art right now .
  - I did actually . Was there with friends and didnt get to paint . I ll be in Berlin in May however and intend on getting work up .
- - the last thing snell needs is niko playing well at the SF position
  - As long as Snell makes sure his minutes are productive he ll be fine .
- - You seem pretty keen to label others . What would you label yourself  I ca nt be bothered to read your post history .
  - He s a troll  only a handful of comments and a negative karma score
- - I knew you d love were my head is at .
  - Who the hell is that chick anyways 
- - Neo . I ca nt explain why  I just do nt like her at all . Team CRDL is a close second  though .
  - Who do you want to kill her  How 
- - I do nt envy you for having to keep that clean .
  - It s not that hard . She looks good dirty anyway . p
- - That s fantastic  and great to know  Thanks for sharing .
  - It has been a life saver . I miss my baked goods so I have been in love with this new product .
- - If your keen to do some cross country or long distance running  there are a number of local clubs . Let me know and I ll send you some info 
  - Could you possibly send that info my way as well  I m auckland central suburbs looking for some new exercise buddies 
- - So two idiots decide to not take travel insurance while the wife is pregnant . They should pay all the money just for being stupid .
  - What kind of two bit country were they visiting that did nt have universal healthcare anyway 
- - I think someone has a crush on you and secretly wants to be with you . p
  - Laugh  but you know it could be the case ... Maybe .
- - This needs to be fan fiction . I would read it .
  - I know right  It gets me hard just thinking about it
- - I m interested in hearing why you think that the original trilogy was bad 
  - Special effects were terrible  plot line was confusing  not believable at all  weak characters  etc . I m interested in hearing why people think it was good 
- - You tell us how consciousness works  and we ll tell you why . The simple answer is no one knows .
  - Is there any evidence of an animal that can do this 
- - You need half the gain you think you do .
  - I dunno  When I discovered the gain knob on my amp it rekindled my love for the guitar . Glad I had fun with it .
- - ITT . With all these pictures of emails and some claiming to be faking them  I do nt even know who to believe anymore
  - At this point I hope Scott just posts an official message on the website one way or another .
- - Cmon guys  fat jokes are nt funny
  - you re right  but morbidly obese jokes are .
- - The name does not matter at all . Trion picks their own names for the items once they are Accepted .
  - I did not know that  thanks . I suppose I can still submit an idea for a name anyways ; never know  they might like it .
- - This is beautifully written  I would love to see more 
  - Thanks  I have a few more ideas starting to take shape  so it could happen 
- - So if we ca nt come up with a moral reason for them not to be here then  maybe we should change that federal law .
  - That s a rational argument . It is nt the one California is making .
- - Howard and Rocket know each other since he was created in the same experiment and ends helping the Guardians . He makes fun of Peter  calling him a hairless ape .
  - Are you sure  I thought Howard came from a planet of Duck People .
- - JIDF out in full force today . Fuckin creeps .
  - I agree . We need to protect our minorities . People like this should go to jail . Stupid white people .
- - How I met your mother and now Friends . Please add Seinfeld for we can complete the trifecta .
  - Fraiser was already on there  btw . Also a great show .
- - Severus Snape from Harry Potter . I died a little when he did ...
  - It s a tie between him and Steve Rogers for me . Nice to see more Snape fans on here 
- - Learning an instrument is usually pretty fun  and it can be used to impress people haha
  - I am actually brushing up on my guitar skill a bit now . What instrument have you learned  and how d you get started 
- - you ca nt just label yourself a number one shitposter
  - Well it s true . Even before he started aiming at being a shitposter .
- - You can come home and live underground with us . We love pets  we have more than we can count 
  - I always thought that Gensokyo could use a hellhound .
- - How many stories do you have  I saw the one about messing with people you should nt
  - Thanks . I have many stories  some are better than others .
- - lin has nt started in weeks though ...
  - More of a reason to listen to the coach . Not following his directions will not help him get a starting spot .
- - I think so  if you do nt pick it up when you see it .
  - I ve had it pop up in different chests if I do nt take it the first time .
- - My whole family is so hooked to it . Even my uncle does . So does most of my friends .
  - I like Boom Beach more . Amphibious assaults are really fun to plan out . D
- - The issue here is TPU overcharging for deposits as specified directly on their customer service polices in accordance with city code .
  - You should let the management know if you have nt already . Maybe their staff needs refresher training .
- - Put it on my huntard looks awesome with shattered vault cloak
  - I ll check it out  thanks . Hopefully i still have one somewhere .
- - Apparently they re trying to get Tony Wroten . I m assuming it s to give the a Clippers flexibility to trade Jamal Crawford .
  - LAC has repeatedly stated that they are nt trading Jamal .
- - Hey  not even the browns are that bad .
  - Yeah the stuff that happens to us actually makes people laugh .
- - Damn  that is a clean engine .
  - If this is the US then that might be a brand-new car
  - Do they still use Distributors of that type on brand-new cars 
  - Oh did nt catch that . But no new cars use them  maybe except for ladas .
- - I know a beagle that does this  we call it The Bin Lid Necklace of Shame  
  - One might just say that dog is ... bin laden .
- - God  how I wish I could play this game for the first time again .
  - If it s been long enough  and you re high enough  it s close enough .
- - This comment is ironic because you make people hate the warriors fanbase because of a single asshole fan such as yourself .
  - excuse my ignorance  but where is the irony  Not saying it s not there  I m just an idiot and ca nt find it .
- - Congrats OP . I just started my new job today as well .
  - Good luck man  Hope it goes well 
- - Mark Harper and Ian Duncan Smith laughing in parliament when presented with case studies about the effects cuts and changes have had to disabled people .

- - I LOST ALL MY FRIENDS LOL NOT KIDDING
  - My friends are sick of hearing me talk about Death Grips .
- - Any other MSU fans that are just not impressed with Nick Hill 
  - Should nt be running him in this situation .
- - what about taking a year off to travel  Is that a red flag 
  - Not for me  other than I would be very jealous of you and would probably spend the whole interview asking you about your travel experiences 
- - You re not Randy  you re Lorde 
  - I am Lorde yah  yah  yah .
- - What does a dead baby look like in the microwave  I do nt know I was to busy jerking off .
  - What s sexier than a dead baby  A dead baby with downs syndrome
- - Or you could just sack up and do it 
  - If she ended up having a sack her friends will really be talking around that water cooler tomorrow .
- - Well that s just Prime . Grats on the plate . Looking forward to seeing your truck pics .
  - I ll take pics today . it s still dark out now  but I ll get some in a bit .
- - What platform are you on  Has this been happening for a while or is it only the most recent update 
  - PC  only the most recent update .
- - So am I ... please stay safe Edit . wth down voted for asking someone to be safe 
  - Do nt worry about it . Votes are nothing .
- - There are no tricks  I just try to be funny and charming .
  - What about the tricks to be funny and charming 
- - It is the ideal time for the public sector to borrow cheaply to build social housing .
  - Agreed . Would save councils money in the long run at this point too .
- - I usually buy them from one of the Supporter Groups  such as the Screaming Eagles .
  - Yep  this is the way to go  All the supporters tickets should be the same price except for the Barra Brava  which are generally more expensive .
  - Barra gives a discount  not sure what you re talking about .
  - actually  they do nt give a discount .
- - So are we not going to ask about the wallpapers  Can you plz give them out  Gorgeous set up 
  - I will definitely post them when I get back home 
- - Do you have any series preferences  I do nt have any Dual monitor wallpapers but I could make some right now with the wallpapers you choose from my collection .
  - Do nt really have any series in mind  any way I can see this collection of yours . P  Or if you could upload it for me 
- - Yeesh ... they really pushed melodyne to the limit .
  - yeah that was the first thing i noticed as well  so much autotune going on in this cover  not even funny anymore .
- - TEAM CJ ALL DAY . She s just so chill compared to Margaret .
  - Exactly  I love the idea of Mordo and Marg but it s much more like a high-school level relationship and CJ and Mordo is ... less complicated .
- - What happens if multiple people have this down at once 
  - I honestly have no idea . Maybe someone better than me when it comes to rules can answer that question .
- - I ca nt believe they pulled that off .
  - You of all people should believe this .
- - Just a quick reminder  a Taser is to be used instead of the firearm if possible  not to force people into compliance .
  - Ludicrous . Firearms are used in deadly force applications  tasers are not .
- - Yeah I assumed as much  but Falcao should be by this point . I get taking one off but not both .
  - I d like to see Falcao on as well  but I guess we do nt want to risk it . Look what happened to Young .
- - Does nt any lost private revenue translate into lost tax revenue 
  - There may be a loss in GST revenue  but next to mining royalties I doubt it s that much to be honest .
- - Are you using both monitors for the game  Or just one  with the other being used for browsing and such .
  - The plan is to game on one and do random stuff like browsing and Spotify on the other .
- - is there a video source  I d love to do it
  - Unfortunately  I do nt have anything other that that link which I got from the front page .
- - Im on my electric blanket right now . I hate everywhere but here .
  - This is how I feel whenever I wake up
- - god  this game really pissed me off . they were not calling any penalties on the fucking cowboys .
  - You must have not watched the first half
- - Good idea  I ca nt wait to play a class I do nt want so I can use gear I do nt want .
  - The classes are all fun  but suit yourself
- - I am the exact same . Unfortunately my wallet ca nt keep up with my addiction and I ca nt preorder as many amiibos and games as I wish .
  - I work and go to college ; I have a yearly Nintendo budget that is usually enough to get everything I want .
- - What I want is a sequence where you remote pilot a hacked Shank . Controls roughly the same  though jump becomes lift up and crouch becomes drop down .
  - Read Shank as Shark and that seemed way more awesome .
- - How can you determine if a kitchen sink blockage is in the main line or in a condo units line 
  - Might sound dumb but dose your toilet flush with out gargling or backing up 
- - Visit all Baltic states while you are at it
  - Agree  all three are worth it .
- - I got lost around the top of his head ... and somehow i got batman ... wtf 
  - He s the hero you deserve  but not the one you need right now .
- - I was under the impression that Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen did nt use stunt doubles in the final battle scene in Ep III . Was I wrong 
  - That does nt mean they did nt use doubles the rest of the films
  - Huh . I thought that since they were able to pull off the acrobatics in the final battle scene  they could do any scene without the use of stunt doubles .
  - Just because they were able does nt mean they did
- - This will surely improve the relations between Muslim immigrants and Europeans .
  - The worse those relations get  the more the terrorists have succeeded .
- - I think he was saying in Real life
  - I know  but he seems to be trying to undermine OPs statement  like a jackass .
- - ha  never thought of that ... you da real MVP
  - Really  This is the first thing I did . Partly because I thought that s how you uninstall stuff from computers haha
- - I sincerely appreciate all your help  My spouse and I will have to discuss . You ve been great -- cheers .
  - No problem  Good luck with everything .
- - I actually liked their team though . Emphasis on the ed at the end . Seriously predators ...
  - Go look at their post game thread and take immense pleasure in how mad they all are . Dorks .
- - Why does Winston keep squinting  Does Lacy need to lend the man some goggles 
  - he s practically blind ... or he might be crying at this point ... probably both .
- - Yeah  that s terrible . I read about that . Stuff like that happens more often than you d think .
  - st one punch could kill someone  or change their life forever .
- - I dunno ... Explosions inside his face 
  - That could probably do some damage  I just do nt think Mustang will jump to that tactic quickly enough to survive  given his complete and utter lack of defense .
- - Ugh  yeah . That s douchey . What s your opinion of people who take the stationary when they check out 
  - Honestly we expect it to be gone . No biggie to me . We have lots of extras .
  - Good  I always take them because I can always use it .
  - Now if you steal my pen I use at the front desk I will chase you . Lol
- - Story is she pushed him over with her mass times acceleration so he got up and punched her in the face . Love this picture .
  - Ugh  So she can push him around and yell and scream at him but she can not expect retaliation  
- - But I was talking about rape  not cannibalism .
  - Rape came up in that conversation as well  IIRC
- - I made a game like the last one once  but in space with multiplayer .
  - I m pretty sure there s a lot of games with that concept .
- - Maybe stop trying to impose your fragile idea of fun onto other players and just let them play however they enjoy .
  - yup cuz copying everybody elses creativity is awsome
- - Whats her name  if you know 
  - It s in the corner of the vid
- - I m interested in buying some things

  - Plenty of marijuana and a handful of mind altering drugs .
- - The Little Princess . Ca nt handle the scene where Sara s father does nt remember her .
  - I almost cried just reading your comment and remembering that
- - I like Common  but why would Joe be a good interviewer for him  Joe do nt bump Common ...
  - Seriously  Why does that matter  How do you even know that 
- - NOT LOGS  NOOOO  my one weakness ... damn ...
  - Lol logs just have a few simple rules to follow . You will be fine .
- - did you post a screen cap of a screen cap 
  - Hahaha I took the screen cap of the screen cap to post on Instagram . Posted the wrong one here .
- - Absolutely . I m considering calling a few dealerships to see what they might know . I ll keep ya posted 
  - Cool  thanks . It would have been a while ago  rOtring has nt made this style of newton recently
- - You seem to have a disproportionate long neck . Is that a perk i have missed out on 
  - I think the lighting just makes it look like that s all neck .
- - Rogan goes crazy whenever Jones lands anything and does nt react the same for DC
  - DC is consistently getting clean and direct headshots . Jones has lower volume but way flashier strikes . Objectively I think you have to give it to DC .
- - Do you currently have any stuff up for sale 
  - Not really organized or anything  but will be putting up a big lot in a few days probably .
- - Oh heck yea  that is pretty badass . Great job  Any chance you can post step-by-step photos of how you took the thing apart 
  - I ca nt  sorry . It was mostly just a matter of unscrewing everything xD Again  sorry I ca nt be of more use .

- - If you pin it on do you instantly lose your memory 
  - I d assume he d just start leaking everywhere .

  - He s already thrown half as many in this game as he did all season .
- - Hey I m in central time zone too we should hang out
  - It s a big area  unless you are pretty close to Nashville  I doubt it . And you have to bring your own pot .
- - Shoot  I actually thought it was one of his cronies this whole time . Shame on me .
  - I thought that for a long time too . They did nt focus on the frame for very long and it was pretty hectic with the editing .
- - Look at Ebay s rules  they clear up exactly what you re asking . I m not going to spend the time to bring you to their rules .
  - Why did you think I had a question I wanted you to answer  I m glad you did nt waste your time finding an answer .
- - Way to take one for the team man .
  - I should have asked to be everyone s first up vote . I m a silly man
  - Too late for that one anyways mate .
  - He will have to wait til next year
- - How is this a free market issue 
  - Let him finish his second semester before he answers you .
- - Why did they have to make the guy laughing look dirty and fat 
  - Stereotypical plumber look  I do nt think it was an insult .
- - I d suggest a more mute set of plugs . Otherwise  looking good .
  - Yeah  the black kinda makes them look bigger  and could be more intimidating to some people .
- - Did you even read the article you posted  It was taken to trial  twice  and both grand juries dismissed it .
  - Grand juries do whatever the DA tells them to do . They are useless political shields for the DA .
- - English is not my first language  sorry .
  - Hey  it s cool . You meant well  and GREY GARDENS is a terrific topic .
- - Other things that are magnets for harassment include Twitter  message boards  facebook  telephones  and human interaction .
  - No  those are PLATFORMS for harassment . Magnets for harassment include religious arguments .
- - Cm storm quickfire tk  That s the one I have 
  - Yeah it s a great keyboard . Next one I get  I want a keyboard with a wrist rest .
- - Awesome  Thank you for the follow through  Shame it is nt anything interesting though ...
  - Hey thanks for doing this . I can check the sign off the list  I still think the tour is important though .
- - but it sounds shit . elastic audio is good for very small changes but sounds bad for larger ones . waves and pitch and time are much better at longer stretches .
  - It s generally better for speeding a sample up than slowing it down  though . Depending on the sample  it can sound passable .
- - As a white german this sub is very interesting . I learn something new every day
  - Lol I m a black American and I learn a lot from this sub too
- - Damn that a convenient little button . Every restaurant should invest in something like that
  - Better yet  a general refill button . I down drinks like my life depends on it .
- - Right but still  it would nice to have on Android so I could have the choice to use it .
  - I completely agree with you . I m not at all doubting it
- - They ve been doing that for years  every rental I ve had has been like that .
  - Gee could nt be that they have a good reason for it or something ...
- - To be fair  that role did nt exactly show his face normally so if that shocked you it would nt be hard to believe .
  - Did nt shock me  I did nt watch the Hellboy movies until after SOA had started and so I knew ahead of time .
- - In that order  If so may be harder to find .
  - Nope not in any specific order mostly I m looking for anal
- - Welcome back  I sent you a friend request but I m probably getting back on later today .
  - Awesome  I ll be sure to accept it tomorrow when I get on
- - this was nt really all that impressive  but i felt like posting it anyway
  - I have nt been playing for a while and did nt even know this dungeon was a thing . What UT does it drop 
- - I always wondered why I was punching things slower than my titan . I thought well  punching was never the warlocks thing . Now I know .
  - Warlocks are the kings of punching . The Titan stuff is all marketing . Do nt believe the hype .
  - Our punches are like shotguns . Only with more range .
  - And finesse  do nt forget the finesse .
- - i actually really like the visual style of small ant-man world . the glowy neon lights in the last few shots of the trailer looked great .
  - Is it just me or did it look like he was inside a computer or server 
- - i do nt think you re supposed to let people know they ve been shadowbanned ... are you 
  - It s the right thing to do .
- - I m good at making people think I m someone who I am really not .
  - This is both a gift and a curse . It s like having an infinite arsenal of personality masks .
- - Applied on bungie.net and sent you a friend request also .
  - Added you the clan . When I m home I ll accept your request on PSN .
- - God girls are so stupid . I hate them
  - What ails you orange bro from down the road 
- - I think your underpants are too tight or something . You should really learn to relax a bit .
  - I ll do that . You can just keep on crying about your thankless martyrdom of answering peoples questions and how it reflects the decay of society . Douche .
- - Man  I loved edge of tomorrow . Fukkin awesome movie . Too bad the sort of weird name kept it from going big .
  - I do nt think it was the names fault .
- - You could play something other than commander if you do nt like big flashy plays  Only advice I have for you .
  - Oh no  big flashy plays are loads of fun - it s just extra fun to crap on those plays .
- - Can you elaborate on the very different tech between GPUs and CPUs  How are they that much different if they both a processors  just with one designed for graphics 
  - The architectures bear little resemblance . To each other . You need to read some articles about processors . Anandtech would be a good place to start .
- - This is the only argument in this whole ordeal to begin with  it was never about any of the other shit that was never happening in the first place .
  - I do nt think the FCC is talking about regulating peering using title II  just so-called fast lanes .
- - Oh okay  I probably would nt make a move either . Sounds much more complicated than I had expected .
  - Yeah  but I have friends pressuring me to make a move . So that s annoying . lol .
- - Habs game just finished  can anybody link me a stream 
  - You sir have great taste in teams .
- - Times like these I really regret using my real name .
  - Well  what would you do to become a supervillan  if you had the money .
- - thank you . that makes sense . I appreciate the help .
  - You re welcome  Glad you get it .
- - The world doth not know what a talent Thomas Davis is . He brings it so fucking hard every week  and is literally amazing at everything a linebacker should be .
  - I think he s my favorite Panther . I love him so hard
- - God  Steve-O on Jontron grumps would be amazing .
  - Meh  I m do nt think that the G-man is particularly funny . Jon and Steve-O would be awesome though
- - Why does it look like she s laying on a couch  She should probably be in a hospital .
  - Probably after a cleaning . She s most likely already been to the doctor and she has to wear a compression bandage .
- - Meetup.com Come meet your new best friends .
  - Hey good call  looks like fun .
- - Might be better off posting this closer to that event time .
  - Definitely will do that . Curious to see if there are any early planners like myself .
- - I m no pro but it sounds like you need a little break imo .
  - Nah I have nt been playing everyday  just a few hours per day . But yeah maybe I do need a break . Thanks 
- - The medics take you out back and shoot you .
  - I thought they just get sent to the farm upstate .
- - What do you think the order goes  Polar  Empire  PR  VP  HR  Maybe PR ahead  It s close .
  - Empire  PR  Polar  HR  VP
- - Why are nt there places like this near me 
  - Because California is the most wonderful place to ever live in .
- - I ve never considered using graham cracker crumbs as a binder . I look forward to trying this recipe .
  - I think it adds to the sweetness of the meatballs
- - OMG  I am such a Leo 
  - I just read yours and I m so glad I m an Aquarius .
- - I just cant fathom why anyone would put brake pads in backwards . Its very obvious which way they go .
  - Stops the pads from wearing  unfortunately does nt do much for your disc s though .
- - No time existed when people were self sufficient and did nt rely on the Nanny state to police their feelings  Bullshit .
  - Not since civilization  no . Sure it varies to degree but basically ever since civilization we ve had a nanny state .
- - It does nt sound like you have a problem at all  it s that you seem to encounter more than your fair share of assholes . Keep smiling .
  - Yeah . I completely agree . From your description  I ca nt think of any reason why I d be the least bit put off by you .
- - I doubt it will start this month  I read somewhere that it s suppose to be around April but I do nt know .
  - April  Why u even post such bullshits .
- - Yes The plastic feels a little different  though .
  - So if I were to using it competitively it would be able to withstand heavy use 
- - That s awesome . Try looking in your area for a low income clinic - they tend to have social workers available on hand for people like yourself
  - Thank you  I ll try to find one .
- - I agree . I was just saying I think the kid was justified in kicking in ass
  - If it was consensual  I think the girlfriend deserves as much of a whooping as the uncle .
  - Why does anyone deserve a beating for having consensual sex  Is she the nephew s property 
  - It s not about that it s about the betrayal from both the girlfriend and uncle .
- - Oracle Kuda is nt crap with a Priscilla on your team  or a friend . Atleast it is nt guardian .
  - her attack buff is only for herself  not the entire team
- - But the funding gang violence is highly relevant here  because we re discussing crimes  aka illegal activity .
  - I guess I was thinking of cartel violence and not gang violence  so that s true .
- - Can someone enlighten me how this is termed as murder and not suicide for sure 
  - Suspicious deaths are nt always treated as suicide . It s possible it was a murder  hence the tag .
- - It was also tiny  a bit taller but narrower than an ELC AMX  such a hard target to hit at speed .
  - Exacerbated by the fact this was before the accuracy changes .
- - As long as corporations control government this wo nt happen .
  - I d like for government data to be open and analysed to either prove or disapprove points like this .
- - I do nt think they ll ever top LittleBigPlanet .
  - They already have . It s called Tearaway on PS Vita .
- - If your not a tank or healer they will just keep taking dps with a higher IL that apply over you .
  - Well that ... sucks . Looks like I m done with the game then . Thanks for the reply .
- - You have to give an e-mail address to vote  ugh
  - Create a junk mail account . like hotmail or gmail  they re free and do nt require anything .
- - Do you believe your brothers story  If the roles were reversed would you believe your brothers killers story  This whole situation is bad for everybody  I m sorry .
  - I m not sure what to believe to be honest . I have gone back and forth .
- - Didnt believe it . Had to go check Can also confirm . And am also impressed .
  - I was believing it but now I m not sure anymore can someone confirm 
- - Tbh I feel like TFIOS is overrated .
  - Like literally knew from the start that he was going to die and could nt wait because his character was so bad .

  - If you have some vitality or certain rings that increase your max equip load  you can be as fast as someone in light armor while wearing heavy armor  just sayin
- - Excuse my pedantry  but the judiciary is who interprets the constitution in the US .
  - Well shoot  you re right . Looks like I need to re-take high school history .
- - He made a God damn funny  Get back in the corner with your Dunce hat 
  - I missed it too  what did it say 
- - Could be a family emergency and they had to shut down for awhile 
  - Ya that s what I m thinking . I just wish they would have informed their customers on what s going on .
- - Sure  I ve added you but do nt see you ...
  - Yay  sorry  I had to go out for a sec . Thank you 
- - Unless it has changed in the past year  that s a complete lie  unless maybe in challenger  and even then I guess there is a lot of toxicity
  - That s how it was for me as I climbed from Gold to Diamond . But I do play in OCE which is a much smaller region so yeah .
- - Been doing ICF for a month now and no real improvment in my strength  still bench as much as I did when I started .
  - How much are you eating and sleeping

  - Knew I should have brought more than a bunch of grandfather clocks and a hat .
- - This This here is why I m not global .
  - I felt a little rage when I read this and then a funny tingle . Was that me reaching my next rank  
- - but they taped my hands holding a knife pointing down ...
  - Settle down  Jigsaw . No ones that inventive .
- - call me when they start serving music free .
  - You can upload music that you have .
- - Shit thread  post a reason for me to click yes or no .
  - Honestly this is the feedback im looking for . thank you
- - Oh what night classes are you taking 
  - I m taking a one last general education class in Environmental Biology before graduation . But it s at a closer campus than my other classes so that s nice .
- - A car is a weapon in this case . It is a very dangerous weapon . Your title is bad and you should fell bad .
  - That s a little harsh  bad falls can really cause some damage .
- - I rate this one five of five deep breaths and a mantra .
  - I listened to this yesterday . I think this was my favorite so far . It was fantastic
- - They did . Probably because I still have the genitals I was born with . It just added to the disgust .
  - Maybe you should inform them that  using their logic  they are clearly racist .
- - Because they re too new and unpolished . This is why the infamous run actually had a WR .
  - Nothing against newer games  but most of the time newer games are nt good for speedrunning as much as older ones
- - But how can I delete it from the server afterwards 
  - With rsync . Or with a shell script . Or whatever else fits into your workflow .
- - What s brown and sticky  A stick .
  - What do you call a boomerang that does nt work  A stick .
- - Suppose that spanning tree has put the port into a blocking state . The switch will still show status as connected but it is nt going to forward traffic .
  - This is probably what they were implying . What is the show command that would solidify whether the frame would go through the port or not 
- - I really want these Spiderman pops  Glad I live right by a Walgreens .
  - The one I m itching to get is Venom .
- - Bolas is a wedge so I find I do not think we will see it unless it gets a new card that Fits into the block .

  - Scroll through the comments . I am not keeping track of the highest score .
- - I always help my less experienced friend through nightfalls and hes gotten hard light  gjallarhorn and thunderlord . The three guns I lust for the most
  - Why do people want thunder lord  I have it and have yet to see what makes it so great .
  - It looks cool and is a pvp monster
  - Yeah it simply destroys anything in its path in PvP .
- - Unfortunately I do nt have many RS cards . I think I m going to go try to complete it anyways .

- - Cryptocurrencies . Bitcoin  Dogecoin  et al .

- - It s like my heart is getting hard ...
  - Might want to get that checked out .
- - Religion combined with mental illness is a scary thing .
  - Religion is a mental illness and a scary thing .

- - Thank you for hatching my shiny  . D
  - No problem  thanks for the fossil .

  - Can I get one too  This game gave me a heart condition
- - He wrote another book that no one talks about stating why communism would nt work if you real he whole conversation you can see that .
  - Exactly ... what book are you talking about though 
- - At least other users thought it was dumb too .
  - This person is not defending mayonnaise as a gender though  thats not what their words mean .
- - I think he worked it out after he placed the ring and after himself walked into a bathroom
  - Except that he tried that several times before figuring it out . And although he disappeared  he seemed to retain that experience when he did finally break free of recursion .
- - But Squidward is infinitely powerful  so everything is possible with Squidward .
  - Everything is possible as in nothing being everything  which is logically impossible . You re argument makes no rational sense  which outlines the flaws in your beliefs .
- - Long walks in the countryside . Sometimes it s nice to be able to just get away from everything .
  - I ve been thinking about a hike or something sitting around is never a good thing .

  - The shoulder thing that goes up on it allows for all buckshot loaded to heat seek kids in daycares .
- - I downloaded the meditation one but could nt get into it  any specific one that you recommend 
  - Yea . The one on critical thinking is excellent .
- - His shoulder smelled really bad . And he did nt wash his hands .
  - I think you re funny  if that makes it any better .
- - R.I.P Becky  I ll never snort marijuana again after hearing her story
  - Yeah and also I heard that her sister took three whole marijuanas and DIED .
- - my dad always tells this . are we related 
  - It s my mom s favorite joke  Any way your dad is my mom 
- - How in hell s bells did you do that  
  - Makeup sponges and lots of patience and frustration ... And a few hours .
- - Wow ... I first saw it now but thank you so much 
  - Np  I love doing guides for things . P and I also got a nice wallpaper out of it . D
- - I still put mine on backwards a little before I realize it and put it on correctly .

- - PC does nt have hentai  what  Also Netflix started on the PC . God there is so much wrong with whoever made this 
  - Snipars videos are primarily just satire or montage parody styled . That is  the point of this is that it s a joke .
- - me and my mom had a good cry together to Only One
  - It s great how a song can bond people
- - Is ... Is that Bo Burnham  What is that GIF from  . P
  - I think so  probably a Vine of his .
- - It broke my heart a little . I was tempted to go home but just put up with it like a little bitch until I sacked her off a year later
  - Aww well hey  three cheers for freedom bro 
- - If he ever does leave us  it will probably be to Manchester City unless Adidas help Bayern fund a move for him
  - Imagine Messi and Pep ... at Bayern together
- - I ll take him as a backup at league minimum ... Other than that  no thanks .
  - I agree  plus injuries happen ... I wonder if he would be ok with being a backup though .
- - They re in love  Edit . fucking Swype
  - Maybe they re just cold and afraid .
- - omg  Mizzou has a dude named McNulty .
  - The entire offensive line is just one great name after another .
- - No  i do nt watch streamers  i play the game myself
  - You re so manly  fat women want you  and nerdy men want to be you .
- - Probably all the times I replayed Red . I sometimes miss being a small child who found Pokemon challenging to a certain degree .
  - I still hold out hope for difficult settings . One day ...
  - Steamrolling through the game does get old .
  - Yeah  which is a shame  as the games are great otherwise .
- - Cars are a good passion though  which is always nice .
  - I plan on buying a used Ferrari soon and I can say I have that experience to thank for my passion .
- - Does this work with the Iphone  Is it a big deal if it does nt 
  - It does nt . You ll have to get Apple Watch .

  - Yes  Pebble is good but not as flashy . P Ca nt add colour to such watch faces .
- - What the fuck did i just attempt to watch 
  - The most glorious carbine course on the face of God s green United States of America 
- - Im pretty sure most people realize that Hunger of Crota is the second best rocket launcher in the game  just under gjallahorn
  - I do nt know about that  especially when PvP is concerned . Truth s proximity detonation makes its warhead pretty lethal .
- - Someone I follow on Twitter shared this .
  - They posted the same thing twice  just worded differently  they re clearly fishing for attention .
- - Would be helpful if you told us your nationality .
  - Right . European  from Portugal . My bad .
- - Frank Lampard looked good today except for the fact that he s a traitor .
  - wen interessiert das  er tut fr Mnchen spielen
- - What is the issue with using the Ignore All button  That is just one click a day in your case .
  - It s the constant notifications mid-day that irritate me . Plus it s a bit disheartening to be added by so many scammers in such short periods of time .
- - fuck I wish there was one in Portland . there needs to be more streetwear related stores here
  - bro i know  Where do you usually shop in PDX 
- - I ve seen a spot or two here in Michigan that are similar to the place in your pictures .
  - I live in Southern Michigan and can verify . Seen some creepy spots similar to this .
- - Old league legitimately looked like a half-assed grade school project  I have no idea how it ever got popular .
  - Because graphics and art do nt make a game .
- - Yeah  that s true . Those wounds are only just starting to fade . Maybe the Bengals instead .
  - Would be huge if they can win without AJ
- - Do nt see what the big deal is  he sounded pretty honest about his ignorance so what s the point of trying to pin it on him 
  - Because he contradicts himself  They re a decent team  if they are in fact a team .
- - Wait  how are there GIFs if this game is nt being televised  I m sorry if this is a really stupid question .
  - BBC Final score showed the first goal  and others at earlier kick offs  but because its finished now and the arsenal match is on we cant see them .
- - Is his film worse than Megan is Missing 
  - I mean  I ve never SEEN that movie  but ... yes .

- - I was implying that you should use the most underhanded tactics possible . Mostly a joke .
  - Oh  I thought it was the SRA player when I typed that .
- - It s really not that bad . Either that  or I m just a kinky fucker .
  - Far from the worst I ve seen but it made me gag on my egg roll .
- - I totally agree  but I like the stock app switch opposed to the safari like tab view that switch ability imposes
  - So you basically want the original Auxo in the Reachability view 
- - Even when its not solar burn I still use gjhallahorn . Like I tell my friends gjhallahorn doesnt give a fuck what the burn is .
  - I never thought of it that way . I like it .
- - Coach made do it . Either that or I would nt be considered for varsity .
  - Same . Varsity was totally worth it .
- - Are you sure that your boots are not worn to the point that they are out of spec 
  - They are only a couple of years old so I do nt think they are worn out of spec
- - I have legit shiny gliscor  chimchar  buneary  riolu  swablu  zorua  ralts  psyduck . Interested in any  All have pentagons
  - I am interested in gliscor  chimchar  buneary  riolu  zorua and psyduck . What do you need 
- - So ... this means that this will be removed .
  - If it does I do nt feel like doing it  lol .
- - So have you sign up to that airbnb to see if his FB page is linked 
  - It is linked but I ca nt see his page  I know it s verified 
- - I have a similar one . It measures pressure and predicts rain when the pressure drops quickly  Cloudy when the pressure drops slowly an sunshine when the pressure is rising .
  - Yeah . This is nt really a forecast the same way as what you see on the news . It s just the best prediction made from barometric pressure .
- - Torsion testicle is the compartment syndrome for your balls . Hope you recover quickly 
  - Yup thats what it was  Thanks fellow ent .
- - Actually it was a great response to an otherwise stupid comment . The fact that you ca nt see the hypocrisy in your own comment is comical  but typical .
  - What was your point as it relates to the as Scalise issue 
- - None  what kind of guy cries at movies 
  - Watch out people we ve got a tough guy over here .
- - Great shot - I was in Oregon trying to shoot a similar scene with redwoods but could nt get the fog ...
  - I wish I had some tips on how to capture it  but this was mostly just being in the right place at the right time .
- - Did you get to meet any favorite players  What a cool adventure  GO PHILLIES 
  - Haha thanks  Philly was awesome  but I do remember that you guys had some TOUGH fans when your team got down a few runs .
- - What I mean is like even my first ever pvp match I did nt do that bad . I definitely got at least a kill or two
  - yea i understand that  I can only guess they were new or unlucky and just destroyed every time spawning .
- - Too bad he could nt get Hawks fans vote on if he gets a penalty or not .
  - You picked the wrong Blackhawk to insinuate he does nt deserve an All Star spot .
- - Just in time for the filthy democrats to tax it more here in Pennsylvania . I love how they think they re helping people by taxing others . Fucking idiots .
  - You do know that tax money is needed to help support the roads that you drive on .
- - And now they re sayin i cant trade it
  - How did you get a hold of it 
- - I find the dead cartoonists and suppressing of free speech more offensive .
  - sad that we have to remind people what the offensive part of this story really is .
- - Problem with this game is  you will miss out on a big chunk of content if you do nt pre-order . The whole night hunter mode or whatever .
  - Which  if you ask me  is proof enough that the game itself will be lacklustre
- - I am all about an animal based economy system
  - Hahaha that s a pretty funny typo . What can I get for two ferrets 
- - my favourite part was how she said women take longer because of the clothes they wear . did men make them wear those clothes 
  - By feminist doctrine women are essentially children . They do nt really choose anything . Everything is forced on them by men .
- - Lol complaining does nothing just look at arms warriors
  - Still as dull as i remember it . nothing really changed IMO
- - Ugh these generalization ... do nt for a moment pretend like you guys ai nt as bad . Just check last year ... Bring on the down votes
  - I really appreciate your honesty  how can I argue with that 
- - Aww  that was cute . Let s keep him .
  - Only if you promise to take him for a walk and clean up after him 
- - I agree  there is no god and this is not the proper place for such a conversation .
  - Says the OP of the thread ... If you already thought this why post 
  - To see if anyone could present an argument that makes anything that resembles a point .
  - Yes  but ... why post it here if  in your own words  this is not the proper place for such a conversation 
- - I have never been spooked that much before man
  - I agree  that startled me the F out lol .
- - Too bad that they are not using blues anymore .
  - I ve never tried blues but the razer clicky switches are pretty awesome IMHO
- - Shades of Z  he loves that move
  - Thats what I was thinking . To which Hank got this move from Yzerman  passin it down to the next gen 
- - Kevin Spacey . He s a great actor  but he creeps me out .
  - no way . he can stalk me any day .
- - Pierce splashing piss on him at the end is forever my favorite part of this scene .
  - Using it  Plus  did nt Shirley give birth in the same spot 
- - Even they look surprised that your house did nt burn down .
  - Haha seriously  or like little fire demons that could nt get through the gateway from hell to burn my house down .
