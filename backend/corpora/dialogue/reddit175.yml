  - The built in Steam functions are a big selling point . Altough some of these games are maybe not what you want to show your friends that you are playing .
- - I think you are confusing sexual harassment with sexual assault . I would not classify this as harassment at all .
  - Ah  thank you for that clarification  I did nt think that sounded right . So you would classify this as sexual assault
