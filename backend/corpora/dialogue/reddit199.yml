  - Dude  those trains are wicked expensive  Not to mention the tracks and tunnels must cost millions to dig .
- - Any way you slice it  I m sharper than most ... Are you up for a challenge 
  - Hmm I think you ve got me . This could turn into some Hobbit in an underground lair stuff and then we d all be in trouble .
  - Loose change ... If that made any cents 
  - I m pounding my head trying to come up with something here .
- - I ll be honest  Russia was the better team throughout the entire game .
  - Absolutely so . They neutralized us more or less .
- - He s unique and he s hip ... Let this man express himself 
  - Nobody is stopping him . We re just expressing our revulsion .

  - Yup  just photoshop and a drawing tablet .
- - Try the stream from the OP  you paid for it already so it s not piracy right .
  - That s my thought process on the whole thing . Doing what you said .
- - God I d love to take you like that
  - I d love to be taken by you  x
- - Upvoted  please consider doing similar background story on other exos . Thanks 
  - Hey thanks  I m planning on doing other exotics in the future .
- - Because your body is struggling to process it . This is especially true with heavy carb meals .
  - So basically  eating less carbs keeps you awake after eating and feeling less drowsy . I think I d experiment with that .
- - Impressive . Definitely wouldt have the patience to do that myself . Also the music choice was perfect .
  - Great patience is achieved by listening to podcasts and beer
- - This is game breaking . I ca nt believe QA missed this .
  - I TOLD YOU SOMEONE WOULD POST THIS  I TOLD YOU 
- - Oh yeah  forgot to include that  also you dont need one infront of each just one infront of both
  - Ooh yeah  I forgot about that . O In the end  I ended up not being very helpful at all 
- - And this is all those dip shits managed to do . They did nt save their religion  they damned their fellow followers . Ignorance should be a terminal disease ...
  - It is in one way or another . It just ends up taking others with the ignorant though .
- - That s so exciting  Good luck 
  - Thank you  After the year we have had  I ca nt see myself without a job .
- - tell me something you have and I ll put it up for something then

  - Hehe G Level Stones . Only in Frontier do you see such things .
- - Possible trolling  but I ca nt tell if it s a really bad troll  or just really bad english .
  - Not  trolling i just posted that from my phone and I m old .

  - You act like the Cowboys are the ones calling the fouls . You d celebrate a TD too .
- - Neonazis latch on to the demonstrations of PEGIDA but the movement itself is not racist . It is very anti islam though .
  - It s a nationalist movement and therefore wrong .
- - How do they compare to PBT  Never really hear about POM keycaps .

- - Is nt there some kind of FEMA camp you can put him in 
  - I d do it myself but I do nt want to get infected .
- - Yeaaa ... no . Garth does nt have angels and demons hunting him down .
  - Well  he probably has some demons hunting him as well  but that s beside the point . Even on basic monsters  he tends to be better prepared .
- - Sweden offers a simple answer . No .
  - We were nt asking . We were nt demanding . These people are  however .

  - Good god bless those dirty girls  Hallelujah  Hoes on high

  - I think he s one of those guys
- - Does it have any built up dust

- - Oh thanks  love your name by the way
  - the first one to do so . thank you .
- - These two guys have really made SL s morning . What a fantastic  controlled partnership . Sanga is a gem .
  - Really wish I d gone down to the game to watch Sanga in action .
- - Not true . Otto Graham  Fran Tarkenton  and Sammy Baugh all liked to scramble .
  - Baugh and Graham were out of the NFL by the time passer rating was developed . Tarkenton was around  but he was kind of the exception that proved the rule .
- - Melo has been in the play offs nearly his whole career .
  - Last season was the first time he missed the playoffs .

- - What these guy s did this Eric Raymond is awesome . We need more Eric Raymond s in this world to contribute to the OSS projects .
  - His contributions are minimal and his personality is unbearable . Do nt make me say what I really think .
- - If Sony decided to pay Activision some money  then Xbox would be the second rate PC would still be third rate tho ...
  - Yeah but Sony does nt care about it s community enough to do that
- - Same with many GSP fights that went the distance
  - It s the champion style of fighting to not lose  rather than fighting to win ... it comes with the territory ...
- - Tell that to Tralf  Merlini and Godz . They will gladly flame someone who messes up .
  - And they manage to do so without being offensive shitlords  to boot .
- - If I recall correctly  they had video of him kicking all the flowers off of her grave .
  - And you never thought to ask how they got a video on a billboard 
- - claws ai nt op on maxed accounts either .
  - unless you re the guy running around in ahrims with no overheads
- - Mine as well  lol  Happy birthday everyone 
  - Exactly the same has you . Have a good one buddy

  - Dunno my family s from the north and I get it . Also my cousin get s a full on red beard
- - he looked like he wanted the wrestling move
  - Perhaps a coy plot to eventually ruin the wrestler s back  So subtle .
- - Assuming your friends are nt assholes who will look down at you for it and stop hanging around you because you re always so negative
  - Then they are not friends  are they 
- - You also need friendly with ice faction just by killing things
  - Ok that would explain it . Im not friendly yet thanks 
- - One thin I wan na say though  is that secret is not part of GGA  at least not yet .
  - I realized that on the re listen I seem to remember GGA mentioning that they were in talks that didnt work out but in the moment i brain farted .

- - They re having his return on fucking Smackdown   WTF are they thinking  Are they still trying to undercut the guy or something 
  - It s SD  s move back to Thursdays . Might want to start it off big .
- - He would say it is also a set of beliefs and not simply a group of people .
  - Just wondering if he was going to give a blanket statement about its followers or claim it is a religion with a peaceful history .
- - This is like watching cats fight  faster than I can follow and supremely entertaining
  - You just hear the hits . Do nt even see them .
- - Any easy to get guns with this

  - People love that Gale St. grub . It s an institution .
- - Why would lower oil prices negatively affect the steel industries ... Should this situation not make the production of steel cheaper 
  - That facility produced products for the oil industry . Lowered oil prices means lowered demand for the steel products . The steel industry as a whole is nt affected
- - Ok I understand . I m not sure  I would email support

- - This could not have happened to a more deserving company .

- - they sell that magazine at our Meijer grocery stores in the checkout lanes . Great paper . Hope this helps .
  - Really  I checked Meijer every time I went in there but never saw it . Probably was nt looking at the right spot .
- - I do nt think noah makes it . His play is greatly translating into wins and helping the team but it s not reflected in stats millsap may be a better choice
  - If Millsap makes the all star game i ll cover my dick in peanut butter and have my dog lick it off
- - All this means is ... no person has any power against a very powerful person .
  - No  what this means is that if you are going to accuse someone of a crime make sure you re not lying .
- - Hold on  I just got the memo 
  - I wonder how long it will go . Also  am I a bro now 
- - Wait is the previous season current season thing a mod or a recent update 
  - It s a vanilla feature . Click the building  then click the little spiral icon at the top of its dialog .
- - I do nt think you know what you re talking about .
  - Wipe means when a whole team dies . That would never happen when you can respawn .
- - At the very least scouts should be able to cross them with no movement penalty .

  - Of course . So your turn OP  truth or dare 
- - Handball  What a touch from Jordi  Iniesta is such an elegant footballer it s ridiculous .
  - Iniesta seems to have regained his form . He needs Messi and Neymar to feed them .
- - Let s take a lesson from Canada and make the victims famous rather than the shooter .
  - How about you go for actual journalism and report the facts without an agenda 
- - Almost definitely a problem with the APN settings . Just use Google to find out what they should be for your carrier and check that they are correct on the phone .
  - Thank you  we got it working . . D

- - Carnival phantasm  I was just going to start it today but accidentally ended up marathoning the whole thing .
  - I keep forgetting to watch that one  how much did you enjoy it 
- - now lets hope we get some actual good casters who know what they talking about
  - if its the riot pulse guy  then be prepared for a shitter caster than deficio at the start of his career .
  - that last part is unecessary  you only look at casters for a couple minutes before each game anyway
  - and  thats my opinion on what he looks like  you dont like it  block me  or dont read it simple
- - As a resident of Tulsa  I am now inspecting my furniture .
  - Haha sorry to make you doubt the cleanliness of your furniture

- - No we are nt . Many animals feel compassion  your speciesism is showing 
  - I ca nt tell if you re being sarcastic or not ...
- - That bike was very nearly stolen . I wonder what stopped them 
  - I am wondering the same thing . Perhaps someone drove or walked near the area . Or perhaps they had trouble getting it started .
- - Liberals never have an issue spending other peoples money .
  - I do nt think you understand the term Libertarians because they are the least for spending money of any political group other than Anarchists
- - I had nt even thought of that .
  - I do nt come here often  so I thought of it right away when I typed it in .
- - Is Thunder Strike going to be used at all in the late game  The same question for cyclone . they both seem to be very very strong .

  - They wo nt . It s supposed to be a huge gil sink .
- - Once drugs are legal  cartels essentially die off . EDIT . Also  drug cartels without guns would be considerably less dangerous .
  - This is true . Legalize drugs  cartels and gangs lose a huge source of income  less guns in criminal hands  and crime will hopefully go down .
- - This was part of RAW when they were doing the angle where they introduce Kane . He s telling Kanes origin story right here .
  - So it was aired during RAW  Man . I do nt remember that at all  Thanks

- - Wobbles always brings the hype . MAYBE THIS IS HIS YEAR
  - Scorp vs. Wobbles Mario dittos in GF plz .

- - The wallet app keeps track off orders and packages . So does searching for my packages in google now .

- - Wow  this takes me back . That was probably one of the best episodes ever .
  - Can you point me to somewhere where I can find the name of this episode  All I have is OP s gif to go off of .
- - The mixing needs a little work but its sounding really good  Very impressed .
  - Thanks  If I may ask  what parts do you think need work 
- - If you only have internships would nt descriptions of the work you did be more important than education 
  - No - most internship programs pale in comparison to a FT role  so your degree matters much more to me .
- - It s unintuitive to you because you are accustomed to doing otherwise .
  - It s unintuitive because it s not on the screen .
- - did you message him from your real account or a throwaway  if he had reason to think the account was a fake then that would explain his paranoia

- - Dog likes licking the window . Our neighbours must think we have a weird bunny .

  - Worst Meat Loaf cover I ve ever heard .

  - What  It was a question  not an offensive statement . How did you get here
