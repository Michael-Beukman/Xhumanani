- - Yea  off day is pretty lame .

- - How would having multiple Riggers with the same signature vehicle work  Does that even work 
  - Nope  specifies only one person can have a vehicle as their signature vehicle .
- - Yeah but I do nt think I ve ever waited more than a minute to get back in .
  - Yep  the queue is very quick usually for me even during peak hours .
- - Would you consider a Peach US  for Pit 
  - Sorry no . That s far to common .
- - Is there a DL link for this 
  - Yupp  should be provided right under the waveform on soundcloud 
- - I just hold my breath with every one of these patches that it ll include another set of monk nerfs .
  - The nerf is in there somewhere  I m just having a hard time finding it is all .
  - I ... I think there s a rogue buff in there ... right 
  - rogues were already buffed more than any other classes .
- - You do nt notice the difference between those two  One feels a hell of a lot different from the other .
  - I ve never set it off but finding that in the dark when I m expecting the lights always scares me
- - I ve been to Liverpool and had rocks thrown at me .
  - They were just trying to provide you with the means to balance cars as you steal their wheels
- - the grateful dead reminds me of this really potent drug called the grateful dead
  - Tripping while listening to the dead is awesome  like mixing two drugs together . Should be called dead flipping

  - No  though I never really used nfc . I miss the notification led 
- - It s a manufactured story even though the FBI is actually investigating and actually are looking for a person they believe is the suspect

- - Haha  love the toilet shots . Fits look good .
  - Ha  yeah  no full bod mirrors in the house . Thanks .
- - Cody Ross is the worst player on the dbacks ...
  - Maybe he is  but he was one of those guys that always seemed to come through with a big hit as a Marlin .
- - Just bench them and then they ll see it
  - If I had a bench at home  I would . I need to get a bench ...
- - I had the same problem  but I found that buffing the top layer off and then soaking seems to help .
  - I tried that also . Maybe I just have really horrible luck
- - Do nt buy with certs  invest . Ask yourself . Will this help me get more certs 
  - That s a pretty tragic way of looking at it . I think about two of my weapons have paid for themselves in kill XP .
- - To me it s clear ; he was available at a very cheap price . Wenger loves a bargain and thought he could turn him into a top PL striker .
  - Was nt he a record signing  I seem to remember him having that record until zil came along .
  - Might be wrong  but I think that record was still Arshavin s prior to Ozil .
  - Cazorla is also up there  I m not sure on an exact number though .
- - Hope you enjoyed Scotland . We are a bunch of nutters .
  - We deep fry Mars bars . That should be enough of an indicator of how crazy we are .
- - You unwrapped every atlas  What the hell man .
  - Yeah for some reason I was sure they would have missed one . They did nt .
- - Where is vodka  Where is marinated herring 
  - Weird  that s usually the first thing I say when I wake up in the morning .
- - Yet the numbers who did nt protest and riot outnumbered those that did by billions . The media never mentions those people of course .
  - Clearly the media did mention them since that s how you learned the cop was a Muslim . Just saying .
- - I know  I know . Close enough for me though . That horrible cunt ruined Oreos for me .
  - I feel your pain . My favorite cookie was tainted and spiked by her lip smacking and the quaking of her jowls with every word she spoke .
- - Ugh  I ll be fucking pissed if Theory of Everything or Imitation Game is nominated ahead of Gone Girl . EDIT . Fuck .
  - Or Whiplash . Whiplash is far better than both of those .
- - Does anyone really care what all these washed up  bigoted assholes think  It s giving them the attention they crave so badly . Who wins here 
  - If ignoring him made him go away  I think he would already be gone .
- - I hope my future looks something like this .
  - I wished my present looked like that .
- - Zelda is the princess . Link is the adventurer 
  - thank you i had them confused i thought link and zelda were the same person
- - And there goes my risky click of the hour  hat s off to you . I hope I got the right comment this time .
  - For some reason  my phone loaded just his face and not the rest at first so I assumed the worst .
- - The lighting looks off but I like it . Looks a little surreal .
  - when i first turned on the game i thought it was a video game . took me a minute to get used to it
- - That s what makes this game great though  we all look at it and go about it different ways  no one is wrong  no one is right .
  - That s true  but I m also not requesting that they change the activity rewards because of my personal opinions .
- - Your editing hurts eyes  this video is sometimes smooth and sometimes just eye raping .
  - I did nt want to say it  but yeah .
- - Is there a backstory to this  Sounds interesting .
  - Just wanted to let CF know the legion has grown by one .
- - I really want monestary siege to be playable in control  however I do nt think it will cut it since it is nt gaining you any card advantage .
  - I ca nt help but feel an Ascendancy or two would just be so good in UWR control .
- - is there a sub for this  Tooth brushing is weirdly sexy for me ... I do nt understand it either .
  - I m going to wager a guess an say its the swinging boobs thing . I know it gets me going 
- - I think if we map reset then everything should be reset .
  - All my levels . C I do agree though . It would be fair  You are correct .
- - Yes . Its not good for it . But neither is sliding sideways .
  - Wheel hop puts more strain on your suspension and a little tire . It is nt bad but it wears them down a lot more than just sliding
- - It s true in my set . As for your second question  I have no idea .
  - crap . well I guess I ll have to try and ask  thanks for the confirmation
- - Guys  as a casual retard who is anti-sjw  I must hate myself Sorry .
  - It s okay  we all hate you too .
- - There was even that video of that dog attacking a boy  but his cat came flying in and charged the pit bull  causing it to flee .
  - It did nt really look like a pit bull .
- - Needs spacers on the rear . Nice car nonetheless .
  - Nah  it looks like he may actually drive the car .
- - Hahaha what is that face for  
  - I guess for him  it s not for smooth balls .
- - You still want a code  Not OP but I got two .
  - No I m good . I m not short of money . Give it to someone else . Thanks though .
- - Dead Island  they somehow made the best trailer I ve ever seen . Game sucked ass though .
  - This is still one of the best game trailers ever 
- - Why are all of the lights pointed in the same direction 
  - The lights were aligned with drivers in mind .
  - Yes  but since when are three traffic lights used for one lane of traffic 
  - I see what you mean . Maybe there s an intersection with more lights just out of sight .
- - Hiya  Sorry for the very late reply  I m available now to hatch for you 
  - Excellent  I ve added your friend code .
- - I just got finished with that exact same situation . It definitely is nt easy  but you ll have it all behind you soon . Good luck my internet friend .
  - I appreciate that . I know things will get better . Just hard to see the forest for the trees I guess .
- - Oh  that looks really interesting . O-o I ll add it to my massive GoodReads list and hope I can find it in my local library .
  - Yeah  it s probably my favourite I ve ever read . Really really good  he s a great writer .
- - Fuck off with your self righteous victim blaming .
  - If she got out  has a support system to keep her out and goes back  who is to blame 
- - There s always the one retard that has to fucking ruin the silence .
  - I d like to think it was in homage to Charlie Hebdo . Nothing is sacred  and you ca nt let the attack change that .
- - It s just a rumor it does nt exist  just like fight club .
  - we are not supposed to talk about it 
- - Cool  so I can apply to be a rematch at the en d of the m o nth 
  - I do nt know about that  necessarily . They do eventually close sign-ups for being a Rematch Santa  but I do nt know if that date has been decided .
- - Build parallels . If you want flavor  you need surface area .
  - That was going to my next build unless I heard something different on here . I may try some tonight .
  - Do it . You wo nt regret it .
  - Alright well looks like I ve got a new project for tonight . Thanks for the suggestions guys 
- - We can only assume Muscle Man smokes a shit ton of weed .
  - he certainly has the apartment for it .
- - Valkyria Chronicles For VN you ca nt go wrong with Steins ; Gate
  - Oh wow did nt know there was a game on Steins gate thanks a lot for the suggestion
- - Real Steel  you know the one where Wolverine became a professional Rock Em Sock Em Robots player
  - I still do nt get why that movie had a cliff right in the middle of a junk yard .
- - I am watching this cross-legged at my desk in moccasins . Maybe I do need a foot hammock .
  - Jeah I was thinking about buying it  too  then I realized I do nt have a desk  yet  so I ll have to wait until I moved .
- - I do nt care Tony . You keep doing you . Got the steal to make the opportunity in the first place .
  - But there wo nt be videos of the sick steals he makes every night .
- - I d say he did a pretty good job . I really enjoyed it 
  - Cheers  I ll let him know at least one random on the internet enjoyed it haha .
- - Very true . I share most of the same sentiments . I just wish this photo were clearer and not as dark .
  - I know the guy stopped responding also not sure where he was in zancudo
  - Looks like hes on top of the ufo .
  - Yeah but which one  The zancudo I assume the yellow stripe is throwing me off and it looks like the sun is shinning
- - I have seen this posted before . I call karma whoring . now give me karma for calling out karma whoring
  - OK  evil atheist fedora wearing comcast loving Sagan hater .

  - Glad to see such a positive feedback from one of my videos 
- - Was this a game from this year 
  - Yes it was . The rams did lose the game though

  - You have to ask the guru kali for that 
- - Has anyone ever won something with this  It seems so hard to win but I really like your Idea
  - it s hard because the chances are not very high but you need to keep trying
- - Why does the thumbnail look like a vagina 
  - You should watch the video and find out .

  - Your Voltaire and statism are incompatible  serf 
- - Hey can you prove you re actually in NC  Thanks .
  - Why must I prove anything to you  stranger 
- - They have too many ways to get sexually excited and be pleasured . I m confused and jealous .
  - I m not sure if you re talking about men or women ...
- - ITT . People who ca nt pull off stealth themselves claim it s easy because people that can make it look easy
  - I assure you I am more than capable of stealthing . I just think that once the strategy gets out  it becomes easier .
- - Is it sad that I would play this game  Is it sad that I would play it more if that music was playing too 
  - If that s sad  then I m sad too .
- - I think your English is quite good 
  - Why thankyou  Kind soul  you are .
- - No . Why would you think this 
  - Because you can use it to shoot into someone elses bubble . It s a reasonable question if he got a Hardlight and is wondering if it s worth leveling up .
- - What was the over under on this game 
  - It s literally right above the comments .
- - Maybe a stupid question but why does your csgl look different 
  - It s lounge assistant  an addon for chrome
- - Man that penalty was a killer . Went from putting offense in great field position to Lions  O driving down the field .
  - Guys like that do nt deserve to play . What an idiot .
- - lol ... you took time and went trough your kb to find all of these kills  i think he wins just by making you waste time ahahaha
  - Time  More like just looking at the first page of someones KB .
- - Maiar . Like Gandalf and Saruman . The power to change the balance of the world with the humanity to enjoy life at the same time .
  - So what would you do with your power 
- - Why are there so many people standing on the expressway 
  - The photo was taken during the opening ceremony I believe .
- - Is nt north and south just relative as we are on a spinning globe in the universe where nothing is up or down 
  - They re arbitrary  I ll grant you that  but they most certainly are not relative .
- - I m dedicated . Here  hold my cabbage  I m going in .
  - I suppose that s one way to live up to your username .
- - Good news is we may see D-Mo back in the starting line up . These slow starts kill us . Anyways until tomorrow guys . Take it easy
  - Have a good night  if you still can .
- - I have watched Marchisio play a lot of football and I still ca nt figure out where he is best utilized on the pitch .
  - He is a man for all seasons . Plop him anywhere in the midfield and he s great .
- - I m going to buy CDs at HMV today . When was the last time you bought a CD at a physical shop 
  - Let s see ... it was the time I bought a Carcass album and a Cannabis Corpse tee .
- - it looks like your driver side door is intake  so you have that going for you but ya  well done to you car for taking a beating and not you
  - Ironic part about it is that  I had just replaced that exact door from a previous accident .
- - I think Pulis will do wonders with Berahino .
  - Seems unlikely . He s not his sort of forward . Anichebe will get a lot more games . Berahino is going to have to work hard
- - WOW . You ve got some serious tickets to a serious gun show .
  - Thanks very much . I hope that I can find a con sometime soon and go play . It sounds like a good time .
- - It s not even clear who Hae is saying is possessive .
  - Yes it is . Who else could it be . She only started the diary after the junior prom - first date - and her murder was the end of it
- - I was just reading some pages on landscape photography  one tip was do nt cut your picture in half with the horizon .
  - yeps ... class on composition will teach you that
- - I love the fact that he s selecting Cardinals from all over the world .
  - That s been done for a long time now . Just FYI .
  - True  but Francis has been very conscious of  and is essentially the poster child for  moving the focus of leadership away from the Vatican .
  - I missed that one . The cardinals all go to the Vatican regularly and the Pope lives at the Vatican .
- - Not entirely true . Grand Moff Tarkin knew or at least had suspicions that Vader was Anakin Skywalker
  - Tarkin would nt be looking over lists of every cadet on every planet in every system  though .
- - You people are my heroes . I m just getting accustomed to surviving Apollo . Congrats
  - I survived Soyuz today  and it s more difficult than I imagine  Boy  was I in for a shock  I ca nt imagine how Apollo is now 
- - Not to be rude but have you tried asking your son  I tried a pill identifier too and did nt find anything  sorry .
  - I need to make sure its not like a supplement or anything before i approach him or otherwise he ll get upset that im invading his privacy
- - A Jger Bomb  as in only one  Damn lightweights .
  - Yeah just one for breakfast . Ffs .
- - Im always shocked that none of the employees that saw it before it whent of the floor did nt take it .
  - I work at a goodwill and we ca nt buy anything from our store period .
- - is this going to steal all my passwords and take mors virginity 
  - No  but Mors did have the idea first .
- - Might draw the ire of the people pissed at the Washington Redskins
  - Never thought of that  good point . I get it but also wish that were nt an issue
- - The sort by new comments  links to an older thread .
  - Were you embarrassed when Malfoy did nt hug you back 
- - is there an attack champions only button 
  - yes you find it in the settings and can put it on every key you want . My problem with it is that you can not use it while using attack move
- - Yes  but nobody ever learned a less from dying .
  - Usually stops them from doing it again though ... Usually .
- - Fun fact the Seminoles were the only tribe not uprooted by Andrew Jackson . They refused to leave and he could nt force them .
  - He did however rampage through Spanish Florida and kill a bunch of them .
- - Why did nt you leave for LA 
  - I did nt want too and plus I kinda told Lucian I wasnt allowed there .
- - I do nt know  that would be a pretty good Prison of Elders
  - I agree  however  there are some Tomb Ships in the background .
- - Have you ever heard of sample size  It means you think your epeen is larger than it is  and size does matter .
  - That s not what my mother told me ...
- - Seriously  I read the books ; there s really nothing boner worthy in them .
  - Must ve just read the part where he rips out her tampon . Real sexy .
- - Everyone who could answer this legit is still at work
  - This might sound ridiculous but is tax season the same as busy season 
- - Ah  another fellow worried french person 
  - Glad to see that a lot of people are still worried about FN in our country .
- - This is going to blow up in your face when he inevitably gets tired of hearing about all of the guys you re making out with that are nt him .
  - I dunno they re pretty heavily invested with four months of friendship here . I honestly ca nt think of an amount of time together that is stronger than four months .
  - I know right . Friends for four months  When s the wedding 
  - Swear to god I knew a guy and this girl and at four months they already had teenage children because it was such an unfathomable amount of time .
- - Do you need an OS  monitor  Keyboard  mouse  etc 
  - i have a mouse  keyboard and OS already . I do still need monitor  and all the hardware 
- - Music . A whole fuckin  lot of it .
  - I wish music still did the job .
- - You need the booster . Also some cars are just terrible . Power Pistons is the best all around .
  - Sometime the cars are so shitty tho that they will fly off the track when they go to fast though .
- - what is you are not white  i.e . indian 
  - I would still say navy and charcoal are much better options for all day wear or business .
- - I like the concept but I hate how they hack at bottles of water  it looks like something out of the show Ultimate warrior .
  - I usually stop watching once the building is finished . I do nt need to see them hack at bottles and glassware .
- - Cabbage and beans . If I m going down  I m taking some of you with me .
  - That d be a disgusting execution to attend .
- - So ... I still do nt get the air raid sirens .
  - They re used when tornadoes are in the vicinity .
- - The defensive play is called contain  so when you defeat it  it s called break contain .
  - Ahhh that makes a lot of sense . Thanks .
- - It wo nt fix anything . Government sponsored monopolies created the problem ... I would nt be so quick to trust the government solution .
  - As depressing as this is its probably true .
- - thank you sir . yup ... i figured i would incur some wrath  but no big deal haha
  - No problem . I was nt having a go . But for what it s worth I ve heard the exclusion zone is the best .
- - The slap  What the fuck ... Are they out of ideas 
  - Well it s an adaptation of a book  so sorta  yeah .
- - Remember when everyone was so hyped about the field spell and talking about how broken pendulum scraps are 
  - And then people realized that it was terrible and MUCH less consistent than the regular build .
- - She was in the third season and I agree that this was most likely from that drama .
  - the laugh track was what made me automatically assume the High Kick series
- - He s doing just fine right now . Staying within his role and letting the game cone to him
  - this is my favorite comment so far this year .
- - Frosty Jack  White Lightning  Been there dude  shit scars your liver but damn it gets you drunk quick .
  - Never mind your liver . It scars your soul .
- - Maybe it s not the same issue that I had then ...
  - Might not be . May be either the hosts file or maybe I m running out of memory
- - No  you ca nt . Unless that s been changed in the last two i ve used it .
  - Confirmed . You can not be logged into the game to use the mobile AH .
- - Not to sound like a snob  but I can think of better examples than the ones they listed for mn off the top of my head .
  - Off the top of your head  Calm down brainiac .
- - Some men ... just want to watch the world burn
  - I was hoping for a Fallout line . ty .
- - Do nt forget that miss by Icardi . We could ve been fucked
  - Pogba had a chance to finish them as well . Football is filled with such uncertainty
- - From farther away  it looks like poop smudges  I knew it was nt but it sure looks like it .
  - Yeah I see that now lol . THAT would be embarrassing
- - Bout time this first period ended . Jesus .
  - Cause Jesus he knows me  and he knows I m right .
- - Valleys is fire emoji as fuck . Raised by Wolves killed it .
  - All I want from this entire drop is that white valleys pullover . So nice .
- - Do nt worry . Nobody outside of Germany has seen German TV programming either .
  - There are Derrick repeats on here like every single day .
- - I like that you like that he likes chivalry .
  - I like that you like that I like that he likes Chivalry .
- - It s too bad the balls are nt symmetrical .
  - It s too bad your balls are nt symmetrical
- - But why oh why do nt they just embrace webkit  What do they have to lose 
  - The web has everything to lose by removing another rendering engine . We already had this discussion when Opera switched to WebKit .
- - sometimes i feel as if sarcasm has not been discovered by certain people in this sub yet .
  - Well it s not like it s obvious .
- - That s also MRW I tell a joke and it falls flat .
  - So you are doing that now  then 
- - It was really good after reading Fall of Reach .
  - Fall of Reach was an excellent book .
- - Congrats  I ll drink and have a smoke to that 
  - You and I both  Happy New Year .
- - I feel like they could have at least hauled it away before shoving it unceremoniously into the wood chipper .
  - They chipped it  Was nt big enough to get some lumber out of it 
- - I m guilty of catching them and letting them go . Maybe if I m nice they wo nt come back lol .
  - lol i did nt want to risk it  dirty lil buggers x.x
- - You are a chain Legal Seafood . Stop denying it .
  - I ve been to chains that are better ...
- - Wow . So far it looks like a landslide .
  - And for once in the direction I want  hooray
- - did nt know also that french fox specialty is sex
  - Me neither  I got ta catch up on some of this
- - Timothy McVeigh was caught  I believe  for a busted tail light .
  - He was driving with no license plate  actually . Edit . I ca nt even .
- - It s nice  what kind is it 
  - I m not sure ... My father gave it to me .
- - Even if Bama wins  they need to figure out something with their secondary or Mariota is going to put up basketball numbers .
  - I think whoever wins is in for a bad night ...
  - Definitely . Mariota is ridiculous . Our defense has been an atrocity so far tonight  so I do not want to play against them right now
  - Me neither . But you never know .
- - Do you know what reparations they offered for the other downed flight  Or was that Malaysia air 
  - Yes  this is a different airline .
- - Damn  what a way to spend a cakeday
  - Oh I had no idea what you were talking about and then saw my little cake icon 
- - I wish Bloodborne is connected to Demon s Souls .
  - me too . I wonder if that umbasa thing from the leaked video means anything though .
- - I have to ask . Real dream or beautiful fiction to respond to the prompt 
  - It was a real dream  amazingly enough
- - So  NRA members  is this a good guy with a gun or a bad guy with a gun 
  - Well cops are good guy  and only bad guys shoot innocent people . Does not compute . Critical error . NRA bot self destruct sequence activated ...
- - only if there s jack in that coke .
  - Hey now  he s just a puppy 
- - Am I the only one who thought this was a new years joke 
  - THIS IS . FINALLY SOMEONE WITH A BRAIN .
- - Hehehehehe . Your husband . My hero . If I start now  I can have monday  Thursday and Saturday night football back
  - Why ca nt you just watch football  And yes  I m married and we have our different interests .
- - I m confused  is he threatening to sue you 
  - I think so . Apparently the guy is a convicted felon too .
- - I did nt get that he was implying that at all . All races have lazy leeches .
  - I think more minorities are important to make the majority more inclusive and respectful to different kinds of people
  - World is a small place . Plus  proximity has little to do with acceptance and elimination of racism . I mean slave owners lived pretty close to blacks .
  - True . The internet is good enough to debate it
- - Did you have some additional MOD installed  I remember a LP video where the Portent survivor had a gun .
  - Nope  just long war . I m not even running the DLCs on this playthrough .
- - It seems like you have been gone since last year 
  - Came here to say this . Bravo .
- - That s debatable . Gel  Tastes pretty normal . Skin  Nah .
  - Well  you generally do nt eat the skin part . The gel is delicate and sweet  sort of like cactus .
- - I do nt see a bias  either .
  - Of course the most biased poster here would nt . You want to tell us all again how sad and distressed this is making you 
- - need Elements flair . I prefer the Elements logo  but the Alliance name . I m totally okay with it .
  - If you were ever a skater you can wear old elements clothing and say you re representing the team . They had some really cool shirts ...
- - The Caps look a lot better in the third than they did in the second .
  - Unfortunately for us  that s a low  low standard .
- - Mostly reaction gifs that I never get around to using ...
  - Pretty sure there s one for every situation now  except I can only remember a few
- - Utah  I build oilfield equipment . Everything from structural to pipe work .
  - Huh  Utah resident here . I build tanks for oil fields .
- - is nothing but media hype and the placebo effect .
  - Yeah  no . That s not true . Do nt disregard something because you have nt experienced it .
- - Dunno  but Stephen Hawking will be the first super villain . Dude s too smart to be good .
  - Carl Sagan  Stephen Hawking  and  Neil DeGrasse Tyson will be the supervillians by your logic . Ca nt say I disagree .
- - I m not being hostile I m just telling you my sources which I guess are nt that reliable
  - I read Buddy  in a sort of aggressive way  my bad . I do nt doubt the Canadian special forces are an elite group though .
- - IMO  popular culture does . Have you been aware of the rising popularity of neuroscience the new pseudoscience on the block 
  - No  I have nt seen information about that . Who calls neuroscience a pseudoscience 
- - If you still need someone to help you out  I m available
  - That would be awesome . What are you looking for in exchange 
- - Eh they ve had some good times since then
  - Hey remember when we beat New Mexico State  That was pretty cool
- - Gorgeous  What colors did you use 
  - Honestly  I m not sure which purple it was specifically  but I know it was pravana .
- - Great . Now work hard and get rich and show up to her fjord one day Great Gatsby style . Happy ending all but guaranteed .
  - The opposite sex has been the driving force in all self improvement to date in my life . Well ... except for my video game career .
- - Logic - Under Pressure Listening to it right now
  - Came here to say that  along with a few others .
- - Dreadful team to watch . Thank god they did nt manage to get a bye week  I could nt stand to watch that team next weeks games
  - By then stanton would have hopefully been healed and the game would nt be terrible
- - Completely forgot to include plastic type . PLA . And you are correct . Noticed some more as the print continued .
  - Also consider using the glue or hairspray trick .
- - I know it s a lazy argument  I do nt really mean it seriously  it s just some dark humor .
  - Ah  gotcha . I mean  the reasoning for the latter half is sound  haha .
- - People who focus on skins vs people who focus on the game
  - So you ca nt focus on both 
- - Yes all page views are logged Sorry for the panic attack .
  - Where can I acess it  I ca nt find it on the menu .
- - So a train stopped on the lift hill and this is news in New Zealand . Must be nice there .
  - The news has little to cover outside of Orc invasions .
- - sorry first five . will be doing more tonight though 
  - what time can i ask you sir 
- - I like the media remote . I use it daily . My dog did get bored though and ate it so I bought a new one .
  - Your dog ate it  God I feel bad for the poor thing .
- - Another disappointing BUG commander . I was hoping they d follow up Sidisi with something playable ... not so much .
  - Mimeo and Damia have really set that bar high .
- - Note to self . NEVER piss off D.J . Augustin
  - Do nt forget . NEVER piss off D.J . Augustin
- - Just enough to get killed  obviously .
  - Not in this case  never let a crisis go to waste though . Democracy blah freedom blah terror blah bullshit
- - That was nt even antagonistic . But he s right  and you re wrong . A headlining artist officially announcing before the lineup will never happen . Ever .

  - Unless the aliens all worship the same gods as us . Then it s atheists who would be fucked .

- - you on cocaine  you re yelling everything
  - I d yell too if I was shitting my pants .

- - I liked the first part of the anime  but the last few episodes felt pretty off .
  - I m pretty sure they were expecting a second season  if you ve read the Manga it was leading into a new arc .

  - It apparently sold a lot better outside of Japan . A surprising amount better  really .

  - Is LastPass safe to use when rooted

- - Lol you sound retarded . He is nt Getting traded . We just need a real coach and it will be fine .
  - I know he s not but I just cant see the situation improving and I want to see him do well . Frustrating all around

- - No  they could shield their building .
  - But both the personal hotspot and the official hotspot are inside the building  so that does nt help at all .

  - Hmm  I ll have to think about it . P

  - After annexing several classes in military aviation strategy .

- - This thing will never die  huh 
  - I will report until someone in Chattanooga posts lol .
- - Holy shit . I just installed Chrome Refresh . This is a god damn game changer .
  - Which one  The easy auto one 
- - I think he responded appropriately to your spastic response and then you made a personal attack about not being invited to parties which is a pretty lame burn .
  - Then I will not be directing anyone to a burn unit since it was less than a first degree burn .
- - whats up with the marionette s legs 
  - He s basically a ragdoll dragging himself by the head .
- - When talking about guns  I mean hand guns . people have guns to hunt with .
  - And even then you are still wrong . There are plenty of legal and illegal handgun owners in Toronto .
- - Go for it . It s worth having extra GPU horsepower rather than CPU . That way  you can play mostly everything at the same frame rate .
  - Except that CPU is nt going to be able to handle much more without bottlenecking .
- - Yeah kinda un logical . But apparently there is a official back story that says ajay was part of a gang and military . So he does nt care about killing .
  - It s a video game . There does nt have to be logic .
- - You think I d have learned my lesson . I am an Ohioan of course .
  - There are a lot of lessons you have nt learned yet .
- - why not just change it to be like jakiro s liquid fire  toggleable cast
  - This is actually a really good thought 
- - I had n idea  although I suspected some scifi story might have used it  but I though some classic writer like heinlein or asimov or vance some such
  - There s some surprisingly good stuff in the comics . no one ever notices .
- - Im counting it  And im guessing that the Bucks will slide back to the median line in the next game
  - Oh duh . Carry on . And I sure hope so . I would love to see them find a way to continue this trend throughout the season .

- - That s right around the corner from me  I m down
  - Message me your address and ill send them out today .

  - i figured but you just never know there might be an interesting story behind it  so i asked
- - i feel like every month we get this exact thread o.o
  - Sorry  I m new so I did nt know ... unu
- - I like this All State commercial for some reason  I just ca nt put my finger on it .
  - I m not sure either  but it sure is good .
- - Do u have any other tablets and how would you compare it to this one 
  - Feels just as premium as an iPad . Maybe more since the design is so novel .
- - Ahh that s right  Did you attend  Or do you remember hearing anything about how the event went 
  - Nah  I watched the recorded livestream after the fact . But it looked like lots of people were able to attend the virtual space .
- - I hate pay walls . p But that is a really interesting study . I m going to have to do some digging at my school library .
  - i doubt you ll find it at a school library even if you are talking about a college library
- - First impressions . I ve been offered every job I ve interviewed for .
  - I have applied for a new job at a few places  I just hope I get an interview .
- - When will people realise they ca nt be reasoned with . They just need to be exterminated like a cancer .
  - When will liberals realise they cant be reasoned with .
- - Did that kid just learn how to curse 
  - I think he s just on coke .
- - Suh is the Teflon Kong . And I stole that from a buddy .
  - You should have let him keep it .
- - When that s all that happens in free roam then it gets REALLY annoying .
  - Tank shooting gets annoying . A bunch of fun gunfights  Why not 
- - We did nt want to pay for England s wars . Simple .
  - of course  the colonies had no interests at all what happened on their borders ... Makes sense .
- - WWE Sponsors decide gimmick matches to plug their products .

  - Yup . Repeat to bring HUD back  but you ll be doing it blind ...
- - try actually reading the post this time .
  - Do nt be a smartass  he edited the post after I posted the comment .
- - Fuck I hate that rule . What a dumb penalty to fucking take
  - It s a good rule . There was a time where any sort of panic was avoided by the defensive zone team shooting it over the glass .
  - I can understand the need for it but it bugs me .
  - We all hate that penalty when it is against us .
- - But he did nt attack them  right  He s just bringing out the internal contradictions . It s low effort  but not offensive .
  - Yeah  but if someone pretends to maintain high values  then this low effort comes handy to show the mirror .
- - At what point are you just pouring a rosetta the hard way though  . P
  - Haha . That s what I was thinking
- - Ugh . That guy seems so condescending . I can only stand him for a couple minutes .
  - You should really give his books a chance . He tells some really incredible stories  and has a great sense of humor .
- - I d go to at least the game against the Seahawks . Probably be cheaper than going up here .
  - Without a doubt . I went down there this year when the Broncos played in STL just because I wanted to see Peyton play . It was dirt cheap .
- - I guess it depends on budget and tastes . Otherwise  I d suggest Hearthstone 
  - Seconded  just started yesterday and its great 
- - if a cow was you would you be a cow 
  - If you if are a cow would where a cow be you is 
- - Same . Coming back for an easy paycheck is not something we should be looking for our national team players to do .
  - Dissenting opinion . Higher caliber players in MLS force all surrounding players to engage at an elevated level as well . This is good for the league as a whole .
- - The resolution part kind of bummed me out but I loved the rest . Great work 
  - Thank you  Yeah we like to find the dark side of silly sometimes .
- - Haha  so if someone stabs a pregnant woman in the neck  the cop has to duel him on the field of freaking honour  That s so messed up 
  - yeah  you got ta love US gun laws .
- - Ca nt wait to see all the comments about how it copied Frozen too much .
  - Man  this Defying Gravity song sure does seem familiar ...
- - But both microsoft and sony have more than video game products .
  - And  By that logic retailers would nt want Microsoft to sell PC products online .
- - I just watched Incredibles two days ago . I m so fucking prepared for this thread .
  - And THAT S what you write  Way to blow it

  - As a comedy guy  I love its comedy .
- - Who deserved to be in more than AU last year  Obviously the game ended up being close  so if AU did nt deserve it neither team did .
  - The point is that the SEC has gotten the benefit of the doubt  and that s bullshit .
- - Also  I ca nt stand the color of this FA Cup ball . As you were .
  - Yeah it s impossible to see most of the time without a super HD stream .
- - They re porn dude . Like any porn  interest is there  which is proven by the amount they raised  it s just not talked about .
  - Visual Novels often are sexual  I would hardly call them porn tho .
- - Apparently did nt even read the title . Not sure how he thinks a woman could divorce her husband after she s been killed .
  - What  Both the title and the article indicate the divorce happened before the shooting .

  - And lots of people are bitter spiteful people for good reason .

  - Yeah . There s some fantastic deals when you spend some time digging .
- - rhymes also have to have the same amount of syllables
  - This is not necessarily true . There are many types of rhymes .
- - And this has to do with Linux . Oh wait  it does nt .
  - Well the Kerbal Game Simulator is for Linux also . Maybe good enough connection 
- - I m gon na need a source on the claim that Will Ferrell has eyeballs .
  - Source . Am Will Ferrell s eyeballs .
