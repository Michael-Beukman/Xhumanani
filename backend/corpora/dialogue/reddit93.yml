  - Wait who is he taunting  There arent even any teammates near him .
- - Thumb  index and pinky are a very thin coat of CG Ruby Pumps over SC Ruby Ruby . Middle and ring are three coats of the unbelievably beautiful Zoya Oswin .
  - I just saw Oswin for the first time today at Ulta . I picked it up for sure 
- - The fact that some muslims are offended by this is what makes it hilarious ... How pathetic must your faith and religion be if someone else s opinion offends you ... 
  - By that logic  calling a black child the N-word would be hysterical  right 
- - I have enough experience I left out of disgust for how many people were clearly just trying to use me for their own goods .
  - That sucks because I do nt see that at all in the online and real life feminist communities I am a part of .

  - That s a bigger ask than Smalling just improving on the ball imo
  - Sadly this might be true ... Is there any reasonable excuse for doing mistakes at that level 
  - Lack of composure and poor decision making  sometimes there s no fix for that . Look at Titus Bramble  he could have been a great defender .
- - I miss him on The Daily Show .
  - Last Week Tonight is better on every level though .
- - Do they just leave the grandstand up all year round 
  - No . I learned from a greens keeper that some of the stands are shipped to and from Augusta for each respective tournament .

- - I gave up halfway through  reads like erotic fiction to me .
  - bummer . the second half is the best part .
- - Jim did quite a bit of winning in the playoffs . Which is why it was so dumb that they ran him out of town

- - They have to have sex there to assert their dominance .
  - For true assertion you need to use the owners bedroom .
- - Are Texas coaches really mad that Charlie is recruiting Florida 
  - I for one am ecstatic that he is recruiting Florida . That kind of pipeline would be insane for our recruiting .
- - I can open bananas now . Well  most of the time . I really do nt know what I ve been doing wrong my whole life when opening bananas

  - I think I ll forget about the scale now and do that .
- - really tempted to give gold for such a beautiful comment ... inspiring
  - Thank you  I put a lot of effort into making it perfect .
- - I m wondering if Jimbo is actually willing to bench Jameis . I feel like he might  but it d just be so shocking .
  - He did nt get three turn overs .
- - I live in New York so I hear that  but I was able to get some great nighttime sky shots from some remote spots in New Jersey .

  - That s wonderful  good for you  Is there a specific area in therapy that intrigues you 
- - How much would a house like this cost  And what is the average you have to pay for electricity and stuff 
  - It really depends what city and how close to the city center etc . Houses like this exist throughout the country .
- - I can totally see that it s just personally I loved the low budget feel of most of the season but not for the challenges
  - I feel ya -- they do feel kinda cheap compared to the awesome challenges we ve seem in other seasons .
- - I should nt have posted about this  I apologize for being too personal .
  - It s OK to post  it s just really weird to see those two sentences together .
- - welp boys  time to pack it up  we officially found the most attractive person ever born . our job here is done .

- - Zombie strippers sounds interesting  time to netflix it .
  - Hard to go wrong with a title like that
- - Edge of Tomorrow is and another example that it s possible to do good adaptations of Japanese media for a western audience .

  - I ll do this run for a month then take them down .

  - Yes  he s talking about a paid production .
- - Would nt say Coq is better than Arteta but it s nearly fully fit .
  - coq over flamini however  adds a bit of bite to that midfield and we ll need it against that rugby team stoke
- - Now the US can start hiring strictly AMERICAN MADE computer programmers . Tired of this smelly curry shit . We want AMERICAN MADE ONLY 
  - I do nt think that s going to stop them from using cheaper foreign labour .
