- - No . They re in BF Global  may not be in BF EU .
  - Oh right  That would explain it ... Thanks 
- - so  you downloaded and installed launcher and when going to the mod  menu it said that 
  - Yeah  when installing specific mods from the mod menu on launcher or commander . I ca nt even reinstall regular DayZ mod now .
- - Should girls tell you what they re into in bed or wait until you suggest things 
  - Tell us . Guys suck at that kind of stuff
- - What happens on the field is nt what drives expansion .
  - I think Rutgers and Maryland are great examples of that .
- - Should nt this be getting cheaper  Everything else goes down but bandwidth somehow gets more expensive 
  - They need to make up the money they lose with Global ever since they bought them .
- - Come on . You actually took a photo of a real wall right  right

  - I want to see some more of Tate .
- - ok  you should have them now . as i said  the format is sloppy because of my phone crashing .
  - That s fine  I can see the game and your username  which is good enough for me . We can continue with swap order and shipping info in PM .
- - We did evolve from monkeys you know . Not that weird to have body hair . I find the cultural obsession with body hair removal crazy .
  - No we did nt ; we evolved from a common ancestor .
- - With the exception of a courthouse  or a secure area of a municipal building I can carry everywhere a LEO can .
  - That s what I m referring too . I also worked in a gun-control heavy state  so it s a little different .
- - And then AMRSucks will hop in on the action .
  - why do they have an amrsucks when they already have mensrights
- - Still  breaking someone s stuff is never justifiable . That and he s not teaching his kid brother how to handle situations correctly .

  - Unfortunately  we are on the same boat .
- - You can see what your teammates see .
  - hmm  I ve never noticed that .
- - I never heard of that . How is it played 
  - Each person removes a stick  and the goal is to have no balls fall . Person with the most balls at the end loses .
- - Self admitted double take . You do nt go out looking for a job dressed like that  On a weekday 
  - Is this a ... what day is this 
- - What was the purpose of this  the main characters name in FFX was Tidus . I do nt think you could rename him .
  - I remember renaming him when you sign the ball at the start . They never say his name though .
- - you seem to be missing the cloak . im waiting on the helmet to get the set .
  - RNGesus has not bestowed it to me . He gave me a No Land Beyond from the chest instead . RNG is a cruel mistress .
- - well ... you are right . The style is not as cringeworthy  but the content is as bad  if in different way .
  - We do nt seem to have had any input from any Feminists in the present discussion . Perhaps the Feminists are largely indifferent .
- - It was simply the way I read it  I apologize . That s what it seemed to imply to me .
  - That s alright  we all have moments like that . No skin off my nose  we re all sweet .

- - I always read Yelling Bird in Gilbert Gottfried s voice .
  - he has spent much of his career voicing birds  so not a stretch .
- - Every time I try to watch the others  dance  but just ca nt keep my eyes off of him . The smile  the movements  oh boy
  - To really get a feel for his moves try and keep an eye on his exposed midriff .
- - I did nt make the rules . Write your state or federal representatives if you want them changed .
  - Already said I know you do nt make the rules . Read the comment you replied to  it s not even that long . You ca nt miss it .
- - Where did you get it from  I saw you were looking for one yourself earlier ...
  - Talked to a Team Solo Mid player personally in game  I got some codes for friends but I have one left over maybe two .
- - Did you plug all the cables in  Double check that the motherboard cables are in all the way too
  - I wish that was the issue  but that was the first thing I did . Everything was plugged in .
  - Hm . Check what the beeps are in the book that came with the board  or online . Might be ram or the cpu fan cable coming loose
  - I ll have to try to find the book .
- - Dear god  why did she put paisley on the front of her wedding dress  Just no .
  - I was thinking the same thing . It s so tacky .
- - Jesus fucking Christ wow ... it just seems easier to flip a switch than to have to put fuel in then take it out ... sorry for having an opinion asshole

- - any word when this will be released ... can I contribute btc to the projecT 
  - They are falling behind I guess . I was promised by end of December .
- - You do nt really need to be a graphic designer to know what resolution is ...
  - You are absolutely correct  If you did  then far fewer people would have found this funny . Have a cookie .
- - That s funny because it is now socially acceptable or at least recognized that people spend too much time on Facebook .
  - Yeah  I browse it while at work and regularly go through all my new feed . Personally  I do nt see the point of hiding things from users .
- - I would actually love Shantae as a Smash character .
  - She really would be perfect . DLC please .
- - Try the HM in a smaller size than you take in SM . At least  that s what works for me .
  - HM is forgiving about being small . The shape will be a bit flattened but all the more cakes on a plate .
- - Only word I can think of to describe this creature is Animal
  - That s a pretty dumb comment when you think about it .
  - Are you kidding or just trying to be annoying . The man does not deserve to be alive . If you have a problem with this seek help .
  - I do believe he should be punished  severely . Tortured  raped etc . but calling him an animal is just moronic .
- - It transcended the genre . My wife hates most sci fi movies but loves this movie due to quality of acting .
  - You make it sound like sci-fi as a genre is inferior .
- - I m surprised that thing managed to stay on the ground .
  - His massive balls provided the weight needed .
- - fine then i ll just take a jack  clean
  - Well I did just have a shower .
- - I would probably call it geometric realism .
  - Thanks man  I ll give it a shot .
- - Ooo I could nt drive for a few days with them . I d fear for other s safety .
