  - When I say success  I mean the revenue of the league and also how much it s watched .
  - So the indian league is better than the MLS because more people watch it 
- - Totally agree with that statement  and it s actually my friends house the morning after s party I m sorry

  - Ya the course played really well actually but the ground was frozen haha . From sacramento  was fun to play in the altitude .

  - Having large  centralised religion helps in this regard .
  - It s not anywhere near as centralized as you would think though  especially since the Reformation
  - At least it is capable of having a reformation . Is that ever likely to happen with Islam 
  - I think so  religion is something people created so people can change it . Look at the rise of Wahhabism
  - Wahhabism  You mean that sect hell bent on Islamic purity that makes Mien Kampf read like a children s bedtime story 
  - One of the products of the Reformation was the Puritans .
  - You ve got a point there  I suppose we produced more than our fair share of totalitarian nutcases in the process of becoming a liberal society .
- - if thats failing  i dont ever want to succeed

  - I actually have no idea what that is  but if it s in line with what I said I probably would like it .
- - Just because you were nt around to see it does nt mean it was nt here 
  - yeah i know im just saying i was excited to see some highlights
- - As much as I love Tony Gwynn it s disheartening that Loretta is the only other player on it .
  - To be fair  it s pretty hard to compete with one of the best hitters to ever play the game .

  - Forgot about auburn  Weird because you seem to be obsessing about us lately .
- - I would recommend two at a time . Then she has to pay to have the car towed to a shop . From what I ve heard tows are expensive .
  - My guess is OP knows exactly how expensive .
- - I think when applying for jobs  names  gender and pictures should nt be disclosed  then only the qualifications can be taken into account  no inequalities

  - The fake punt return play  Oh my god I have never seen anything so amazing and I hate the no fun league
- - Hey I m tiz and I m pretty boring .

- - You either escape successfully or do nt escape at all .
  - Well  if you jump the fence of a prison  you escaped the prison . If you get shot afterwards  it becomes notably unsuccessful .
  - Now you re just arguing for the sake of arguing .
  - I think that s what you were doing .
- - Have nt you ever seen movie trailers that contain footage that never shows up in the theatrical release 
  - Not really  but it seems particularly odd for a game which seems to already be struggling for content to cut bits out .
- - Criticism can be very helpful  but only when constructive . I hope this sub promotes positivity and constructive criticism . Looking forward to seeing how it develops 
  - I couldnt agree more  Thanks for your input  I will add it to the sidebar 
- - Holy crap that s a lot of money for Salazar ... You need to blow this up big time . Trade JBJ trade Kimbrel  trade everyone ...
  - I traded someone for him  Salazar was less salary . The opening year draft inflated a lot of people s values .
- - He s my teacher and he s pretty cool .
  - Wow  I do nt know who you are but you have great taste in films .
- - Who says that only one religion can be right 
  - You re right ; I could be wrong about that .

  - Public servants are nt meant to be making political statements  either for or against the government .
- - you re subconscious knows you can just find things through Google instantly  therefore no need to learn them .
  - But if you are TRYING to learn them then I do nt see how your argument holds .
- - This little number from accounts called Left Hand .
  - Does she by any chance have a sister named Right 
- - If you re feeling brave  emerald . maybe it s just me  but I still find it hard and I do nt nuzlocke .
  - If he does do emerald  I always wiped out on Brawly s gym . just a heads up .

- - Fuck you for your elitist attitude  man . That s all I have to say to you .
  - How do I have an elitist attitude because I do nt like my country and I am against nationalism 
- - Anywhere on new years eve . Something about starting the year alone just sets a sad precedent for the year .
  - Well looks like i fucked up again .
- - My thoughts on that would be to start wider and gradually work inwards to the diamond pattern . Go maybe halfway between diamond and shoulder length push up distance
  - Actually I ve been doing that . Started with regular push-ups and put my hands closer and closer over the weeks .
- - I thought it was to store game birds
  - It was in the past  but still called a map pocket
- - Opposing Force is where the military nukes the facility . That would require an evacuation of the surrounding area . I bet this is Opposing Force . Source .
  - My body is ready . Shepard was a great character .
- - Lilly is best girl . Cept for maybe emi .

  - Oh no  Thanks so much . Fixed .
- - I like him even though I have yet to win a run as him . The devil deals are really cool to just take .
  - Right   I love going into a devil room and getting three good items for free . I got nine lives abbadon and brimstone in one and it was great .
- - I agree her behavior deserves criticism . But I also think she may get off from the harassment and negative attention if she is as lonely as she sounds .
  - Thats a good point . I had actually not considered that . Its a much more convincing reason to just ignore her .
- - yes . it has nothing to do with drone strikes .
  - Okay good I was worried there for a second . Carry on ...
