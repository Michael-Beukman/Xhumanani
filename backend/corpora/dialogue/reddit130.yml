- - Up in Dawson Creek here  just got Hound and Snarl last month . Have nt even seen Slog yet .
  - I do nt like you because I still do nt have Snarl . . P

  - Slog just sits on shelves and takes up precious space here in Green Bay .

  - No  condoms should be illegal  because abortion is available . Let s make condoms and IUDs illegal .
- - This is wrong . He voluntarily went to the cops .
  - How so  They got Adnan s cell phone records  after which they went looking for Jay and Jenn . Only then did he speak with them .

- - Plot twist . The mantis is the one having lunch .
  - The mantis seems to point its claw at the lizard and laugh .
- - Just one  suicide . It s strange going to his profile every now and then  none of the pictures will ever change .

  - Heh . Well  I started the buying and I was nt here for the start of the coin . But it is a pretty awesome coincidence .
- - And that is why I live and work in bloomington
  - Same reason I live and work in Minneapolis . Closest I ever get to driving on the highway is taking the bridge over them .
- - It s ok . I would have been first if it had not been for a tourist who did nt seem to understand my directions . P
  - You should of just told them to go left 
- - Mad respect to JK Scott . That sack clearly was nt safety though .

- - I suspect that if they really wanted to condemn and hold accountable these people it would only take a few hours to find them .
  - How could they possibly know the location of the terrorists 
- - I played the demo and loved it . Bought full game and realized it s got nothing to add that the demo did nt already have .

  - Why not  He clearly is one .
- - At least Derrick was able to make a pass .
  - And you know win the game for us
  - It s a joke . I m a bulls fan  but you ca nt deny his shot has been bad .
  - For two games . Not time to overreact .
- - I have an entirely different experience . So there s really no point in arguing since we re talking about two different things that neither of us will agree to .
  - That s fine . Agree to disagree  good luck to you .
- - Tom is at it again  if it s not those fucking rabbits  it s politics .

  - I was thinking more to a penalty for overusing
- - Smiley  The giant blob of death  It ate the salamander fruit and when it blew up or died the fruit spawned shortly after

  - Yep  Better to play it on the safe side and just immediately execute .
- - I think I know what the first one is talking about . I ve seen it . I need to reevaluate my life .
  - You could share yknow ... For science .
- - Driving drunk ... repeatedly . I got very VERY lucky . DO NT DO WHAT I DID 
  - Glad you learnt your lesson  what happened 
- - No - physical violence is a huge turnoff . I cant handle it .
  - You do nt find that there is a certain level of masculinity involved in that situation 
- - notail was consistently performing the best of anyone on the team ... I very much doubt it was a question of skill .
  - They kicked fly  not notail . Notail left on his own  that s what this is all about .
- - Your incest recordings are so fucking hot  they make me question my own morality . This was even better than I imagined . I love being in your head .
  - Haha i ll take that as a compliment
- - Congrats  You must be so much more comfortable now . Having breakouts feels terrible .
  - When I walk by a mirror now  the first thing I look at or think about is nt my zits . It s a great feeling .
- - Moot point  but did nt they bring him back because they were very close to dying 
  - They actually got a hefty amount of money from Microsoft to stay alive in order for ms to avoid an antitrust suit . So does that make apple ecw 
- - can someone please explain how does he quick switch  is it only double tab q 
  - I use the number keys  but I think most people just double tap q .
- - We actually sort of covered that in the back half of the class .
  - That s fantastic . One of the things I actually find most interesting about him is how business minded he is .
- - Bitchin  bead . What is it 
  - A saber-toothed cat skull  in bronze .
- - The tactical advantage with things like those they could siege anywhere they want but I guess they are nt interested in that .
  - Like popping up inside the mountain with an army of orcs instead of outside the gates 
- - One of the best episodes from the early seasons 
  - Nah man  if it s a bicep it needs more veins in it 
- - The sale was probably over and the search database did nt get updated by the time you bought it
  - I think so . Mind you the banner still says there is a sale and it is at normal price .
- - Yeah that shit is gon na give you cancer pretty quick
  - I m aware you re joking but this could be taken out of context  or seriously by newbies .
- - You look like a fun guy to hang with . Keep smiling 
  - I try to be as happy as possible  otherwise what s the point of living 
- - Seems like a poor move on the cops part  the roads around here do nt get salted like they do up north  or plowed ...
  - Plowed and Salted ... lucky . I was blazing a trail yesterday . Just stay between the trees and I ll be fine .
- - So  what did you add to the discussion 
  - An answer to a question and apparently some sort of down voting controversy . But alas we ca nt always be funny .
- - Stop stealing posts from earlier in the day
  - Did this really get asked earlier  I did nt see that thread .
- - Never herd of the place ... meh .
  - They usually exist in major US cities .
- - Why not update this every decade or so 
  - Yes  surely it should be R.E.M now 
- - TELL THAT TO THE ASSHOLE WHO SAT TO MY RIGHT AT THE CASINO LAST WEEK 
  - You re too young to be at a casino ...
- - December to January . Try to get as many referrals for one month before they re gone
  - So it resets every month  That s so weak  if I knew i would have definitely found another referral . Thanks for the info though
- - And it will probably not be again . Only in a high end race shop or some marque dealerships do they try to keep things that nice .
  - You should see some of our hangars we use . Its almost like leadership wants them to look like we do nt use them .
- - Square watermelons are almost completely inedible  though . They are generally decorative and expensive as hell .
  - It s just a watermelon grown in a box  why does it taste different 
- - Nice  I ve been looking for Duosion  please add me back xD
  - Added and coming online now . D hope you enjoy . D
- - If you re looking for a date  the person you re posing with in that second pic looks pretty interested .
  - She moved to Hawaii  and while cute  is probably a little too neurotic for me anyway . P
- - Nice try  but as a kid  reading was almost always on the list of things I was grounded from . Unless it was for school .
  - Ouch . I m happy to say I never had to deal with that though .
- - So is TCU still mad at us 
  - I think it is all shifted to FSU now 
- - Got a chip on your shoulder  No reason to throw manners out the window just because no one can see your face .
  - While I disagree with him  I do nt see how he was rude at all in his comment ...
- - You have Sawbones  but not MBMBAM 
  - I ve been meaning to start listening to it  actually . Just have nt gotten around to it yet .
- - Should nt be a problem since I m using carabiners .
  - When doing that just make sure you weight bearing end is off to one side of the tree instead of centered in the middle .
  - Is it bad for the tree or something else 
  - Bad for the straps  it puts the tension in the wrong spot . It will make for a better hang too .
- - Wan na know how I know we re gon na have sex later  I m stronger than you .
  - Part of me really wants you to get raped . In the anus . By Satan .
- - So are you telling me gifts cost infinite money 
  - I would guess there s actually a provision somewhere to prevent the infinite loop thing  but if not  maybe ...
- - There are medications that do this  surgery is nt really necessary .
  - If the patient actually takes the medication voluntarily . This surgery just ensures that the medication is present at all times .
- - This video makes me sad because it reminds me how much fun Rubick was to play before Valve nerfed him into the ground
  - Thank god we have exciting heroes being played mid now like Brewmaster and Death Prophet .
- - I like Synology  nicest thing is the software  provides a lot of extra features .
  - What do you use it for and how many users 
- - War Thunder does a similar thing . It flashes in the taskbar . It also makes a noise and you can hear the music of the game .
  - I have always loved that feature of the game  especially wih my terrible internet . I can do something else while is loads a game .
- - Just add the other email to your paypal account . You can have more than one . Then it does nt matter which email it is sent to .
  - Oh  That s smart . Thank you . Exactly what I m looking for .
- - You may be the first person I ve ever heard of to get hit by Uranus .
  - No  no - it was Uranus .
- - Then sign him as a DC and pay him HC money . What makes anyone think he wo nt fuck up this offense 
  - He d never take a DC job with all these head Coach interviews he s getting . Plus  Its hard to mess up Matt Ryan to Julio Jones
  - Then do nt take him at all .
  - You obviously have never experienced the pain of watching our defense .
- - Also many men feel ashamed of their sexuality adding to the dysfunction .
  - Ca nt blame them . If you re anything but straight frat bro  you get shamed  by both men and women .
- - You argued that the past does nt matter . Are you now saying that it matters in some cases 
  - I argued nothing . I m just saying that you ca nt really equate stripping and murder as relevant to someone s character .
- - This is my phone account  I do nt think I can this way .
  - Just checked  if you re on android you can  just look under the subscribe button  hit the edit button next to your name
- - That is beautiful thank you for sharing it 
  - Haha no worries  Glad u enjoy . D
- - As the only guy working in my department . I can verify this . Also . It s turned me into a sassy bitch .
  - Just wait until your cycle syncs up with theirs .
- - No worries my lady  I was still able to find your words . Which area is it that you have experience in  boats or the usage of Fingerweed 
  - Primarily the use of Fingerweed  however I am excited to combine this with your expertise of boats .
- - Wow  I am simply stunned by your brilliant elaboration skills .
  - I know  I impress myself sometime .
- - Foxcatcher  I liked it a lot and honestly think Steve Carell should win best supporting actor
  - I believe he s being pushed for lead actor .
- - I like also how Urias  number one comparison is Randy Fuckin Johnson
  - Oh I know  that s ridiculous .
- - Well-done steaks . I like my meat cooked  alright 
  - Me too  The blood freaks me out and does not taste good to me .
- - Rubber  to be fair I saw it on acid but I m sure its just as mind fucky sober 
  - Saw it sober and it was a lot of fun 
- - Well you re a higher rank than I am and is willing to teach me so that does nt matter .
  - Sure . I m online now for a while and maybe later tonight . Just message me on steam .
- - Are we looking at different albums  None of those are suit jackets .
  - I apologize  I think I referenced the IMGUR picture number  not the numbers actually placed with each picture . Lem me change that .
- - Is this one of those things that lets you download more RAM  Cause I need a few more gigs of that stuff .
  - Seriously  gim me a layman breakdown Einstein OP .
- - This would be smart for Jay Gruden after the awful decision he made last year .
  - What decision  He does nt make coaching decisions .
- - That chicken sounds amazing  I love jalapeno cream cheese ...
  - It s the best thing I ve ever tasted  We normally use like a thick cut Maple bacon on the outside  Sweet and Spicy 
- - Bangalter and Falcon need to do so much more together
  - You re telling me  What a duo .
- - Your lucky . I plow in the cars if they dont move by the second snow fall . Though tonight youd have been safe .
  - This car is a bit plowed in  which is why I took the picture . Not my car though . P
- - It s always just the strap placement on SMP it seems  other minor detail errors but the big thing is that darned strap  otherwise fire shoe .
  - Theres more than strap flaws on SMPs ... just look at the neon green sole .
- - I ve wondered this  too . Although  it makes a difference on ogres  especially in the raid  as they are really easy to crit chain .
  - Ogres are easy but everything else  even Knights  is pretty hard to get consecutive shots on in the time frame .
- - Just because Evo got nerf d why stop using it 
  - Because ores no longer drop in Evolution Lab .
- - How the fuck I missed watching this movie .
  - You should watch Tango Charlie too . Pretty hot scenes in there .
- - David Attenborough . His voice is just like velvet .
  - He sounds like a kindly grandfather when he speaks . I ve learned so much from that man .
- - Do not like this  Buy parts in the store .
  - And what about people who live in the sticks and cant buy them in a store 
- - Do nt players require an IF to be upgraded 
  - I do nt think they have to but it definitely helps .
- - That duck is going to have some serious problems when that dries on its feet  is nt it 
  - No  bits of concrete do nt really stick to anything that is flexible and moves . I have had concrete dry on my hands plenty of times .
- - Just learn the skills necessary to make  modify  and repair the tools that automate tasks . That way you will never be out of a job opportunity .
  - A great job if you can get it  but one robot does nt require one repairman  one repairman can service dozens of robots .
- - That s an awesome dog  He looks so happy 
  - thanks  He is a happy little guy
- - Is your guy complaining  Most guys do nt need to come from head .
  - yeah he wants to be able to come from head .
- - This comment is just copied and pasted at this point . Seriously  knock if off with this poorly titled post .
  - At this point your comment is just copied and pasted . Seriously  knock it off .
- - A lot of loyalty for a hired shill 
  - Or perhaps he s wondering why you d doxx a man before throwing him out of a plane .
- - Not pay him that and give him those years . that s what they should do .
  - I agree . Wanted to see what others people say about it .
- - Innocent until proven guilty . A whole lot of allegations so far . Nothing proven in court . I can guarantee that some of the Jian allegations wo nt stick .
  - Innocent until proven guilty only applies in a court of law . The public is free to think whatever they like .
- - Where is this  Why s Majora s Mask in it  Pretty cool nonetheless 
  - It s in Poland . I m pretty sure that someone found that image in google and used it in visualization without contacting Nintendo . P but Majora  yay 
- - Ya  dont shit in someone else s yard . Period
  - Well  this particular yard belongs to a convicted sex offender who beats his wife .
- - DO YOU KNOW ALL THE WORDS TO TELL IT TO MY HEART BY TAYLOR DAYNE  THIS IS FOR ALL THE MARBLES
  - I DID NT EVEN KNOW WHO THAT WAS UNTIL I GOGGLED HER ... DO NT JUDGE ME .
- - So simplify it  yet I never hear Bernie Sanders or Liz Warren pushing for a simple tax code .
  - I really do nt hear any politician demanding that . That s like biting the hand that feeds you .
- - maybe it had balance reasons to make it like that
  - Would nt surprise me . Gaijin already admitted throwing historical accuracy out the window for game balance
- - CPVC  replace that crap . CPVC is known to spontaneously burst . Best plan to remove it and do it right .
  - The entire interior piping is this material . Not going to replace it .
- - yes . how is that almost half of the world 
  - When did I say anything about half the world 
- - She should ve been kicked off the plane . Stupid bitch
  - She probably would have been  if she existed ...
- - are nt kids not supposed to have access to credit cards etc ... 
  - Some have their own PayPal accounts  some have the prepaid debit cards you can get from Walgreens  and others just ask their parents .
- - If you do nt jerk off to her . The terrorists win .
  - I just beat off ISIS  I do nt think they ll be cumming back .
- - The sex is so good she has to light up a cigarette before it s over .
  - I ve never seen anyone do that during sex . Kinda hot .
- - Dude  it s dangerous to walk in front of guns 
  - You live and you learn . I m just glad this enlightened gentlesir could show me the error in my ways
- - Yes  getting there would be mordor .
  - Well yeah  it s not like you can simply walk there .
- - Really great work  and very helpful  but you should credit the photographer . That s a fantastic shot on their part .
  - Definitely . Did some hunting and could not find the photographer s name  unfortunately . I ll try again .
- - Excellent drawings . Cute characters . Funny  yet somewhat thought-provoking punchline . I like it 
  - I thought it was well done . Like the unexpected ending .
- - Haha  I m not sure I ve got quite that look . What do you think about pairing it with jeans and a polo 
  - Jeans are fine . Polo might be challenging if it s too pastel . No matter what the Tims will dominate the look .
- - Hence forth it shall be called van hammer 
  - The a-team van is as fearsome as thors hammer when it drives through walls
- - Power is not just military power either . The EU negotiating trade agreements is far more powerful than Finland or Bulgaria doing it on their own as well .
  - The question is  can it negotiate them to benefit its citizens more vs its trade partner s citizens . That s the vital part .
- - I just discovered this sub and i m so freaking happy .
  - Same here  Freaking love seeing the bullshit called out .
- - Maybe they just think it sounds cool  I dunno  it was a thing in Harry Potter . Not sure if it s the same deal here .
  - True enough . For whatever reason  I always imagined that reciting the spell was actually crucial to making the spell work in Harry Potter .
- - I really thought Gambit would be in some of these awards .
  - That might have been a joke in of itself
- - Anyone think Charlie Austin could beat out Aguero and Diego Costa for the Golden Boot 
  - It s possible  obviously I hope Costa wins but Austin plays loads of minutes for QPR and does nt have to worry about European competitions and such .
- - Is it illegal or can he be fired for it 
  - Only if either of them is not attractive
- - And if it s done with purpose  it may be an indication that you re raising a serial killer .
  - Especially if you re wetting someone else s bed .
  - Stop  you re making me horny .
  - Do I make you horny  baby . Do I make you randy 
- - Nah if the sign poster was like I need laxatives for medical reasons it d be different . Instead they re like grrr revenge laxatives bitch .
  - Good luck getting someone in trouble because you ate their food filled with laxatives . It would be a different story if it was filled with lethal poison .
- - I guess public image . In conservative parts of the country  companies probably do nt want to be associated with weed .
  - Understood  but it would seem that with the right name attached to the research and product that it could sway people away from their ignorance .
- - Wow  looking good . Love the wood you picked out .
  - Thanks  I got lucky on the driftwood at my LFS . It was cheap but most pieces were very boring so I had a good rummage through the pile .
- - If i can keep my presents  im all for it
  - Glad you support it . It s confirmed happening  and today - about an hour from this post . Come on and we can sort out gear .
- - That s infuriating . What were her opinions of the Canadian border  Or  did her vengeance only extend to our dark skinned neighbors 
  - I think she only thought brown people are the problem .
- - If you still need help I m available
  - Nope sorry  the guy at the top is helping me
- - No one sees you as a griefer  and we under no circumstances want you to leave dude .
  - I appreciate that very much  bro . Thanks .
- - i ve fapped so much to these . it s almost like she keeps hoping she gets leaked .
  - lol same here - I think there have been gallons and gallons of cum spilled to these . I m such a fan of her body
- - did an infj touch you when you were a kid or something 
  - If any type were to be all touchy feely with kids it would be infj . Too shy to speak with other adults .
- - Wish my sketching looked that good . I m curious do you use a screen protector on it  How s it hold up to that amount of pen usage 
  - Nah  no screen protector . Seems to be holding up fine . No scratches or anything that I ve noticed .
- - Its full of holes  but watchable . I just wish it was nt cast with underwear models .
  - I would nt mind the underwear models to be in nothing but underwear ... But you are right  the casting was more for looks than skills .
- - Not too bad actually . Thanks  Though I will flip shit if i do nt get a quality HD VLC link or stream for the Sugar Bowl tonight
  - same . PM me when you find one and I will do the same
- - Thank you so much for your help 
  - No problem  Do nt hesitate to post here or PM me if you need further help .
- - Hey what would you take for Battleblock Theatre  I can trade multiple keys or paypal up to you
  - I would prefer keys over paypal . How much do you offer 
- - Does nt his Dashdance grab have more endlag than his wavedash grab 
  - You can jump cancel the dash dance grab to fix that
- - Serie A is definitely fun . Only if people would give it a try
  - I totally would if it was ever on TV here in USA
- - Oh my god I love not playing Ohio State
  - That how rest of our division feels about us
- - You have one big issue . You made my jaw hit the floor and now I m in for a big hospital bill .
  - How sweet of you kimchi  that bill is on me  Also  you re delicious 
- - What form of evidence would you accept in order to concede to that hypothesis  Name the form of evidence and I ll see if it can be provided .
  - Some demographic studies or surveys would be nice .
- - I learned a lot from your post . Thank you 
  - Then you have a terrible low standard for evidence because you ve been lied to .
  - Show me evidence that he s wrong  rather than posting such a hypocritical comment .
  - Evidence is in every reply to his comment clearly calling out his lies .
