  - Most likely not as the last pictures recieves from the lander were of rock .

- - Those goddamn polar bears . I ve had it out for them ever since one tried to eat my friend and then the bastard tried to eat my neighbour
  - And where s the story to this 
- - Damnit  you re right . Buying this TV was a mistake . Oh well .
  - If you did nt want it  mind if I ask why you bought it  You did nt think you were going to profit off of it did you 
- - I have been crying foul since gifting system was introduced . I think valve just opened another door to scammers with this .
  - Gift system would nt be an issue without the trade delay on new items .
- - The point is that minorities will fuck almost anything .
  - Both the system and what has a pulse .
- - Are you out of your Goddamn mind 
  - Granted The Pacific was a great series but Band of Brothers is still unrivaled amongst anything else I ve ever seen .
- - Slayer Pro for veterans . Slayer for ARs with ranks . Social Slayer for ARs without ranks . Just like I proposed 
  - no  Slayer BRs for ranked  slayer ARs for social and unranked playlists .

  - Well we did nt want direct sunlight on our giant TV did we  It s so dumb .
- - What kind of injuries did your brother and dad suffer that caused their death  Sorry for your loss and if its too sensitive of a question to answer I d understand

  - Can Confirm . Source . I am his autopilot
- - Would nt bouncing pod be wrong if they already have lethal on board and do nt need the pod to kill you  Might as well draw a card right 
  - Ya  the fact that bouncing pod does nothing to stop him from untapping and killing you next turn is probably the biggest reason this is not a good mode .
- - hehehe ... I do this ... on Dom and get it to loop with a AI Warbird and Threat Detection UAV
  - HAHAH  I hate you . but power to you for playing good .
- - OH  my bad lol I get those mixed up . Thanks for letting me know . D
  - You re welcome  and thanks once again for the Charmander  . DD
- - I always wondered who those people out there that do nt use a mouse for camera control were ...
  - there s no camera control in this game . only one button that changes your angle
- - Get a flight case that has a tray base with wheels .
  - my cabs have removable wheels ... and my point is that they sound better without the wheels on .
- - Glad you put a finger there for scale . Who knows what size that door latch could have been

- - The metric system is certainly more convenient than the imperial system for scientific purposes  but it s not less accurate or less useful . It s just more efficient .
  - Would say that making something more complicated is making something less useful .
  - In some sense sure  but any application of the metric system could be equally filled by the imperial system without any significant loss .
  - Except for the need of charts to keep track on how to divide everything and the loss of time because it s inefficient when calculating .
- - I like this format  the random dropping in and out conversations are quite entertaining .
  - Also that everyone have their own schemes and plans to betray the others when the time come .

- - I think this Bass Pro Shop is going to fail  the demographic that shops at Bass Pro  does nt live in South SJ .
  - Are you talking about suburban posers who buy gear they use once a decade on that three day fishing trip to Cabo 
- - Just ask if you can work in . Load up your max and start squatting . After one set  they will stumble away  defeated and emasculated .
  - A better solution there could not be  wheymen .

  - I will have to ask him to write something . Stay tuned ...
- - Make him sit down like the woman he is
  - Yes sit down but no need for the sexist bit  eh dear 
- - What currency is this  USD  Even after conversion  what the fuck is with these prices for a DVD 
  - I can only assume its all USD . I did nt verify the prices  but yeah - they re crazy since most can be found free on YouTube or kissanime .
- - I guess you missed it the first time it was around . Maybe in a year you ll get all the Charlie Hebdo posts .
  - You want to play shadow  I guess you missed it the first time it was around . Maybe in a year you ll get all the Charlie Hebdo posts .
- - All of that light is indian  pakistan does nt have the money for it
  - I think floodlights on the border would nt be in Pakistan s interests for reasons other than financial ones . But the title does say they re Indian floodlights .
- - Infinity Blade Trilogy . Best games ever .
  - Agree completely . The IB trilogy would be amazing on Android .
- - Western feminists are complaining about toilet lines and men sitting with their legs apart . Middle Eastern Feminists are waging Jihad against ISIS . Guess which feminists I respect 
  - But they re oppressing me by sitting in a way that s comfortable when you have a fleshy bag of marbles stuffed between your legs 
- - AWWW LAZAR GIVING THE TROPHY TO FABBRI .
  - He s such a nice young man .
- - Thanks  I guess i m not that much of a faggot everyone makes us OPs out to be . . D
  - Woah woah woah  if you re not a faggot I m sorry you just ca nt be op
- - New York ent here . it s not going to happen anytime soon  in my opinion . my reason  NYC .
  - i hear NYC its super hard to smoke in public and you have to be super paranoid about carrying in public because of the stop and searches .
- - How does a dedicated gaming super highway network fair against malicious cyber attacks such as DDOS 
  - Better than servers you have no control over 
- - Sure  we re rich  but Seattle has the most support  big money  and most annoying fans . Are nt they the Man U of this league . p

- - Will you guys shut the fuck up about Bush now  It s like the whole fanbase hates him when he can do shit like that .
  - I ve always said that the talent was there  it clearly was the way the plays and O-line were under Schwartz
- - The down votes in this thread are baffling ... bunch of turds this week .
  - It must be illegal to rank one of the best recent playoff QBs highly .
- - If its edible who cares . Better than wasting . Its protein and various tissues .
  - I do nt disagree  but most people are squeamish and would nt eat mcnuggets if they saw them being made .

- - I m color blind so this took FOREVER to figure out .
  - As a fellow similarly disabled member of the species  I am still lost .
- - His nickname is Big Ben and his last name does nt quite roll off the tongue like Flacco does . Relax .
  - You think they avoid saying the names of players that are hard to pronounce 
- - Its one hurdle but the biggest is the want or need . The mass s clearly are not going to get involved because of macroeconomic reasons .
  - True  especially here we dont have any currency weakness to worry about .
- - David Moyes in his first game for Sociedad kept giving instructions to a player named Stefano . Real Sociedad has nobody in the squad named Stefano ...
  - Yet Esteban and Stephano are similar derivatives like Dick and Richard . Sound completely different but are acceptable as alternates of the same name ...
  - Stefano is not really acceptable as an alternative to Esteban in Spanish . It s a non-issue that a new manager makes a mistake like that though .
  - My mate from Catalonia says its a more common thing there then it is throughout Spain but acceptable non the less  but thats why I said it .
- - They would say that though  would nt they .
  - I would expect them to say what they believed to be in the interests of workers .
- - Great thanks . It ll defo be a new experience for me .
  - Mecca is just up the road too .
- - I think the plan is just draft Mariota  have him be backup QB and put BJ at WR . Simple .
  - Mariota and Winston  depth is important .
- - A charged battery and new coils might do the trick  there s not much help that can be provided without knowing what gear you re using .
  - How often should coils be changed  It has nt been that long
  - Normally around a fortnight but I ve heard plenty of stories about the coil that came in the atomiser being a dud for it to be worth trying .
  - A fortnight you say  Thanks Mr. Lincoln .
- - It s actually corporate communications . So there s a lot of writing involved  but there is also some client interaction needed as well .
  - Well  it s bullshit . I m sorry you re dealing with this  but I do hope in the long run that you are the better off for it .
- - Movie tickets in the first few rows should be sold at discounted prices .
  - Are there actually any movie theaters that assign seats 
- - This is correct  I feel I do nothing in the new jungle now . I wonder if double top would nt be better
  - I remember when relic shield first came out . Two top laners every game .
- - Vote  who are they trying to convince 
  - They are nt trying to convince anyone  they are hoping you d forget about it by then .
- - If you get into it - I ll make you a logo . Trade me for some calls and you got a deal 
  - If I can make a decent enough call I will be sure to keep that in mind  Lots of learning and trial and error left though .
- - If the economy is in good shape  then why has nt the FED raised interest rates yet 
  - Because the bond market bubble would pop of course

  - Ya man  would love to have big community events more regularly to help boost the pvp community 
- - Rockets and planes are totally different . It would be cool though  Save a lot of space .

  - The same shade of purple  not the sheen or anything .

- - Rohit Sharma . Responsibility . Is like Hitler . Hanukkah
  - not sure if too far or not far enough
- - I do nt mind being a single engineer because I love disposable income and sleeping in .
  - How does being in a relationship prevent you from having those two things 
- - Whats your budget if you have one and do you have any preferences 
  - Not sure really  I m mainly a console gamer so I m at your mercy . The cheaper the better but not so cheap it falls apart in a week 
- - Does that mean Darren Young isnt the bunny 
  - I dont see the bunny in the ring ... the plot thickens
- - Can anyone explain why the lungs need to expand at the end 
  - Because they re being compressed vertically  I m going to assume . I m just gon na say they forgot to do that part during the animation process .
- - So much time spent on the make up and hair  they seem to forget about their rancid bodies .
  - I try to forget about them  too .

  - See  the problem is  your bird quit ... and it is no longer legit .

- - Yeah  the content was fine . I just had a hard time not laughing at the constant camera movement .
  - I watched a lot of their other videos and they have the same style . Agree it s kind of annoying actually .
- - John hated the song . He said it was his least favorite Beatles song and that he regretted writing it .
  - Can you provide a source that shows John saying this 
- - I m calling Old and New Testaments . Romans seems pretty clear about the matter .
  - I d say it s not as clear as you claim it to be .
- - I d argue it was dumber to keep T rich playing as many snaps as he did over the other RBs .
  - I d argue it was dumb to only run him out of heavy tackle eligible formations into a stacked box every time .
- - I did nt need convincing  but thanks anyways for proving my suspicions .
  - One example would ve been enough  but I wo nt complain about going above and beyond
- - Well I guess that seals the deal about Febiven going to Fnatic . Welcome 
  - Not without a price though . Eh  Fnatic is such a huge organization I do nt think it ll even matter . Good luck to all parties involved I guess .
  - Peke and soaz had but not cyanide  he is retiring not leaving .
  - Maybe Cyanide had to buy his contract to release himself from Fnatic 
- - LoL haha it s not true ... remember ... we are all in the Matrix
  - its ok when the decision comes I ll choose a person and pretend its Adam
- - A deer running through a shopping center . The woods were miles away so IDK what the hell he was doing there .
  - That s random ... maybe he needed some camo .
- - I can buy that . The extra folds on the knot always bothered me though  and to me it really does look like it s tied backwards .
  - Well if you do nt like it aesthetically  that s a whole different story . Find one you like and rock it 
- - I ve only noticed more engineers . I rarely see anyone talking about anything in valve servers . Chat is just dead .
  - True . Chat seems dead . It seems like it s only used for abuse
- - Apparently simply having been a tourist in those two places makes you a fashion expert . TIL that I m a fashion expert .

  - Garber is giving him a run for his money .
- - He offers to come with me even before I ask 
  - In which case he is hoping for sex as reward  lol
- - Yes . They impact the game way too fucking much . Like every god damn time the Niners ever cleanly sack a QB .
  - Biggest example of this when Ed Hochuli called a helmet-to-helmet hit by the niners secondary ... BEHIND the QB .
- - What exactly is yuck about these pics 
  - nothing but the comments  I assure you .
- - I hope Oregon puts the pedal to the metal . Nothing would make me happier than to see FSU get blown out .
  - They re trying so far  but this is getting to the point where unless FSU gets it together  Oregon can start pulling away .
- - Your point is covered in the disclaimer  off course I agree you should nt start a game
  - You should nt be playing a team based online game at all of these kinds of situations happen on any sort of regular basis .
- - And you re still defending the current eligibility regulations 
  - I lied . I do nt remember pastagate .
- - Fuck Real Madrid . Yep . We re out numbered by Real Madrid fans .
  - Thank you for your spirited and thought provoking contribution to the thread .
- - Season yes train no  train has been in the game and it still feels like the old train after the patch

- - Just a friendly reminder . we are still standing by .
  - We re done deliberating  announcement will come in several hours

- - This comment made my facial and abdominal muscles unexpectedly and rapidly contract 
  - Sounds like a focal seizure . You should seek medical attention .
- - What do you know  Or just take it out 
  - Sorry  I do nt understand your questions . Can you rephrase it 
- - His only offer is from Houston  possibly another from Texas state  but it seems none from oklahoma or baylor as some sites suggest .
  - Yeah  apparently he had just heard from OU prior to the dead period . Either way  kid looks solid and we need more like him .
- - Would be really ironic if your bike got stolen off one of those .
  - Yeah  Joker is gon na come along and steal folks bikes . Just to watch them burn .
- - It only takes a couple thousand of literally millions of users to make the front page .
  - Was referring to the comments ... all of the bigoted comments were the top comments
- - well ... if zeus literally took time to not fuck and impregnate everything ...
  - Are you serious we are talking about Zeus here  The King of the Gods  The first player
- - hello  i have a tyrunt egg that matches you could you hatch it 
  - Of course  I m heading to bed now . Reply any time tomorrow and I should be around . Need a nickname 
- - Are you serious  Come on Guardians ...
  - To be fair  Christmas noobs have a lot to learn
- - Well how do the people of London feel about it 
  - I do nt think they mind  it s basically a tourist trap and the area directly around it is filled mostly with tourists
- - Which is truly confounding . The more they protect bad cops they less respect and support they have . If they throw out the bad ones people would actually like them
  - Yes  the union needs to understand that some bad cops are making all cops look bad  and the union looks even worse when defending bad cops .
- - The way I do it is by uploading my drawing to imgur and using that link in my submission post on here
  - Thanks  thought it was a lot easier then it seems to be .

  - Because it s the first series I watched
- - Try launching csgo . I saw it there yesterday on the main page
  - Yea I found it on the main page  just before launching
- - Again  pooling their resources together to create homes would mean less resources for the residents of the community . Why should they do that

  - He has plenty of good life lessons about what to do to get communities of multiple games and entire polish nation to hate you .
- - Chris Hemsworth trailer during a Marvel show . Hitting every avenue tonight .
  - That trailer s been all over for the past week or two . Not surprised they made sure to get it on here  too .

- - This comment is fantastic and deserves to be seen by more people .
  - I believe you mean  heard by more people .
- - Royalty . Like I am trying to imagine how I could care less about anything than I do about a bunch of pompous inbred upper class twits .
  - A lot of us feel the same way  myself included .
- - Dear god . Please throw that away 
  - I actually did . After one bite I was like ehhhhh  how about no .
- - not interested in the knives  but ill take cash .
  - Without a trade in play I would rather pay retail than purchase at that price from a new swapper  no offense .
- - Came here to say the same thing .
  - Came here to say the same thing .
- - They should really stop using sharks for this . Just because it worked in Egypt does nt mean it will work in Iran .
  - The problem is they forgot to put the lasers on the sharks . If the shark have lasers then they would succeed .
- - I once flipped a nickel and it landed on its side .
  - I once flicked a nipple and it jiggled side to side .
- - Well  Leafs sure do their part to give us entertainment lately  My popcorn budget is going throught the roof 
  - Yeah it was getting pretty boring laughing at Edmonton  a nice break every now and then is welcome .
- - Guess that would make them better than most common core students .
  - My left shoe is better at math than I am .
- - To be fair  it is in the sidebar .
  - Ok  now we are square . I was hoping someone would come by and make sure everything was fair
- - It s an Athena team  not a Ra team . You do nt need red coverage .
  - Guess he got confused because of my kirin flair  Although I could use Echidna as well . Would it be useful 
  - Haha  no just the opposite  I was confused by the fact that guy who suggested the team has a Ra flair  My bad 
  - Oh lol . . p well you were being kind otherwise
- - It made sense to me  just a little wordy .
  - Yeah . I like to think I have a wide vocabulary but I just ca nt use it appropriately .
- - Sounds a bit like the end of Do nt Look Now with Donald Sutherland  but that s an older movie .
  - Nah  it was a show like Beyond Belief .
- - Man  that style is so rad . I LOV the colors  too
  - So freaking cute . I love colorful stuff . But I like the plain black  It s all so good  And the actual process is awesome .
- - There is some research on this and it says there is evidence compression gear aids recovery  but no evidence it help while training .

  - Never burn a book . The paper is far more valuable as buttwipe .

- - Yup  just watched another guy in my PUG get the Gjallarhorn off the Nightfall . I m so salty right now .
  - This guy was a close friend of mine so he would not stop talking about it . Much feels bro .
- - So ... does this mean  Ted is actually just a bean counter  even if he is still officially at the top 
  - It sounds like that has always been the case . They entrusted all football power in Phil as well .
- - If you already own a Vita is a PSTV recommended at all 
  - In very special scenarios . For the most part  no .
- - I m spoiled with Pantheon now . Use it whenever I can .
  - Same . I ca nt imagine using any other company for my Drupal sites .
