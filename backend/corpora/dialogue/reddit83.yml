  - As does the globe and the painting . Pretty much everything about this room is pretentious  to me .

  - He has it . He just prefers Vanilla .
  - I ... uh ... WHAT   I used to play Vanilla  but then I got Complete  and have nt looked back .
  - I think he s just good at Vanilla  and he would rather dominate everyone in it than try to learn how to dominate everyone in BNW
  - he needs to learn BNW then ... or at least gods and kings

- - You know there s an edit button for situations like this . p
  - Thanks man I ll fix it later .

- - thats why you use the colour code i gave you and because its FUCKING RED PEOPLE WILL SEE IT dumbass
  - Okay  you re officially stupid beyond reasoning with .
- - Dude just lock your door . Or if that s not an option beat it in the shower .
  - Bro . The shower makes it all sticky . I do nt want any to get stuck to the towels . I really do nt want another sibling .
- - Honestly  homebrew it then play your PSone games on the go .
  - You can run PSone games on it 
- - And sure as hell  it was a good story .
  - Do we ever know the full details yet  Have they figure out  for real  what happened  and who did it

  - They also have nt really addressed that Latvia and Luxembourg are independent countries
- - What do you have  Maybe someone here will make an offer .
  - Mostly assorted modern stuff with a little silver age stuff mixed in . I have a pretty decent run of asm .
- - Words will triumph over violence  because you ca nt kill an idea by killing it s makers .
  - Ironically the terrorists say the same thing about their ideas .

  - DAE spelling belongs in the museum and no one should care about it  xDDdd
- - courtois is absolutely shit ive never liked him
  - None of the goals were his fault  even the penalty .
- - Black people . It seems even black people are afraid of black people
  - I m not afraid of black people I just get really uneasy and think I might die when they are around 
- - Maybe Hi-Rez decided that giving her emotes alongside her release is easier than going back and giving some to older gods .
  - I m sure that was their process  work on her emotes while they are still working on her animations making it easier to put all together at once .
- - Nope  you have needed a Passport for a while now .
  - A passport yes  but I thought it was visa on arrival or whatever .
  - It is if you re not going for work . You still require a work Visa if you plan on earning in the US

- - This might be the most beautiful picture I ve ever seen .
  - That s might be the best compliment I ve ever heard . Thanks . Haha

  - It my be played better and by a bigger band  but the student section gets more into it at hoops games .
- - I just got turtle beach xo ones for Xbox one and my experience has completely changed for the better . I highly recommend these to anyone 
  - Same - Plus they are reasonably priced and come with mic monitoring . I cant believe some headphones costs almost as much as the console itself .
- - That s alright I was just wondering . I ve been meaning to try rayon for ages now but I guess I ll just have to buy some from somewhere .
  - It s really cheap ... but you get enough to soak up what BP did to the gulf .
- - Good  this is getting out of hand .
  - I was nt aware illegal immigration was such a massive problem in Sweden .
  - where did he mention Sweden  In general illegal immigration is still getting out of hand .
  - look to the left of his username .
  - So that means he must automatically speak as a Swede and not a European ... So much for that unity
  - You asked where Sweden was mentioned . I m sorry if my comment came off as passive aggressive .

  - I take it you ve never closed your eyes after an intense staring contest . That stuff is incredible .
- - Need to add some music  even the free stuff that YouTube offers 
  - Yeah  I use it at our store on a screen without sound so I had nt considered it till now .

  - Well I can love more than one person  also that was a dare .
  - Lol . Im not that grate . But thanks
- - How easily do you think you could try and draw a map of the world from memory  Bonus . Try it
  - I just did . Then I laughed uncontrollably for a few minutes . Then I sighed and felt sad .
- - Sell the current cpu and get something that uses less power
  - Selling parts is a pain  that s why I was hoping to reuse it .
  - Sorry . Maybe look into small cases that you can just sit behind your moniter 
  - I do nt really want anything big enough to house a full ITX board .
- - But that would mean that the are where the rope was tied would not have been touched by the water either  leaving an arguably larger weak spot .
  - She should ve just dipped his feet first and then dipped the rest  while holding his immortal feet .
  - As i recall  and perhaps I am wrong in this  if someone is dipped twice in the river Styx they die .
  - Then just throw the baby in there and let him get out of the Styx  when he grows old enough .
- - Assisted suicide of those who are severely mentally ill or terminally Ill

- - Do nt forget this team usually wakes up in the second half . Let s gooooooo 
  - Better start with the D. We need a turnover . These are the times we miss Mathis in a huge way .
- - Pretty darn cheap for a shot like that  Where you at a dark spot  By a city 
  - A dark site  I drive out of the city to escape the light pollution 
- - If this was the case it backfired . Pepsi stole a huge slice of market share when new coke hit the shelves .
  - I d love to see the numbers .
- - You refuse to accept power scaling so i m done . Have a good day . Or night . To be frank  i do nt care .
  - Ok  no I do nt refuse power scaling . I just refuse that Goku instantly becomes a planet buster only because he became stronger than Frieza .

- - I think you are thinking of Imperium by Madeon .
  - Thanks but that s not it  this song is much slower and repetitive . I ll keep looking

  - Exactly  they finally get it right and then wreck it to start over . Like a kid playing with Lego .
- - I love cooked sweet potatoes ... but how do you eat one without a utensil 
  - if you cook them right the skin will be a little loose and you can peel off parts at a time
- - Perhaps a dumb question  but why no ear protection when firing the machine gun 
  - It just was nt done . Part of the reason why so many veterans dealt with hearing damage after the war .

  - Just looking those up now  they look delicious . Did nt know you could get cream based eye shadow either  Thanks for the suggestion  will check it out .

  - This is what I m trying to understand ; if it s in the context of the world of the series that people care about or the real life contexts .
- - It was absolutely gorgeous as well . I love watching films that really pay attention to colour and use quirky devices  like the paper models of the hotel .

  - I never said it was  I was just comparing a week before vs at the wedding  because her captions were saying both .
- - Does nt the changes to the Dark Portal dramatically change the story of Medivh  What better way to bringing him back then by raiding his home 
  - He is pretty much the Antagonist and the Protagonist . It started with him . It should end with him fighting back against the being that possessed him .
- - AC has been consistently great with native representation . Rogue  which OP was referencing  was also good in that .
  - This I know  just was nt quite sure what OP is referring to . Link is coming up blank

- - If you have a copy left  are you interested in Super Meat Boy or The Binding of Isaac Collection for it 
  - No sorry  played them both already .
- - I hope this disrupts the market enough for oil companies to start investing towards better types of energy .
  - Cheap oil will delay investment towards alternative energy most likely . But most of us are benefitting from this at least . Unless you re Russia . Heh .
- - Please do nt forget timestamp of the product your offering .
  - Oh true   sorry  forgot .
- - So theyre gon na put up a white flag again if we retaliate

- - Regardless of what many people say about getting a music tattoo  this one looks sick as hell . I honestly love this logo .
  - Thank you  I really appreciate the positive feedback .
- - That s why I m doing ROTC . Just bust my ass and compete for the AD slot that I want .
  - Just be expecting some conflict with resolving the two contracts . If you work hard I m sure it will work out though .

  - He s so hilariously awkward . Ayoade is a genius .
- - Any rhinos  Typically what I run into online .

  - He s correct there  but I do nt think it costs that much to ship .
- - Can I still sync my iPod to Vox  Or will I need the iTunes 
  - They seem to have an iphone version coming soon . They d be silly if they did nt sync .
- - Does it bother anyone else that they have the picture flipped sideways 
  - Yes that bothered me too  lol .
- - Probably . Then they ll take it apart and see the water damage indicator .
  - I suppose I could just restore from a backup then .
- - I think it s safe to say that Medan has probably been reconnected  probably for the best .
  - I m assuming you meant retconned and your phone is a jerk .

  - Absolutely . It would need tweaking over time .
- - Yay Kevin Pereira  Attack of the Show never dies

  - Hamiltonians have very little complain about when it comes to traffic . However  it seems to be a civic pastime .
- - The only way we re keeping the trophies is if they hide them .
  - Surely the toilet seat wo nt be too hard to hide somewhere .
- - Except STDs ... Only a condom is good for that .
  - Very true  this procedure is more for people who are in a committed relationship where they have used the pill or some other thing to keep them from having babies .
- - I do nt know about the site specifically  but the prices seem oddly specific to me  which seems odd .
  - I think it s because it s converted from USD to Sterling .

  - Nah  ants do nt have a stinger at the end . You re thinking of bees .

- - No fear  Our roots are in the mud  but the heart lotus should remain above it .
  - play in the mud ; smell the flowers what does should  have to do with it 
  - Nothing wrong with playing in the mud  but eating it will probably make you sick so if you do nt want to be sick  you should nt eat it

  - And English . She is intent on appropriating and shitting all over both .

  - Over LBJ    I agree on Shaq over everybody but Wade  LBJ  Steph  Durant  Westgoat  etc . We got some real motha fuckas too
- - He was nt playing the Game of Thrones though . Ruling well is not the Game of Thrones .
  - I disagree . He did exactly what Littlefinger is trying to accomplish now . He went from nothing to supremely powerful .
