- - Woah . My kids are always asking to go on walks .
  - Do it  while they still want to go .
- - And now I m sad cos Rik is dead .
  - But How can Rik be dead when we still have his poems 
- - Omg thank you so much . D  I m excited  never tried this brand before 
  - you definitely have to let me know how it goes then

  - Are you seeing yourself in a new way lately  Or perhaps some part of yourself really wants to see yourself in a new way 
  - Not really . Nothing has really changed within myself and I kinda like it .
- - Thanks . Just rewatched it but think it s a bit harsh to blame anyone for that really .
  - Yeah it was a racing incident but if blame had to be placed on anyone it would be Alonso .

  - There may be exceptions  but those would be exceptions . This is the rule .

- - I thought it was because they are doing coke ...
  - Generally it s just an excuse for private conversation .

  - That is a very good point . Hmm . We ll see how his next morning goes . . P
- - Just sort by new and your problem is solved . Nobody forces you to sort by top .

- - Well  except for ice-cream and pizza .
  - You know how much effort it took for you to be able to enjoy those things almost effortlessly 
  - A lot . But then again  living itself also takes a lot of effort .
  - Depends on how you live . If you convince someone to build a conveyor belt from your fridge to the toilet  it would sound pretty easy . P
- - What did he actually say  I want to make fun of silly people on the internet
  - He caught his mistake  no making fun of him necessary . Carry on .

  - Are there any specialty food stores or veg friendly restaurants near you that might like to carry our ice cream so that you can eat it everyday 
- - build it and they will come . People will gravitate to areas of public transport in midsize cities growing pop density .
  - But who says we want population dense 
- - Probably the driver mixed up the gas pedal and the brake pedal  or thought it was in reverse .
  - And stomped on the pedal like it was a fat roach .

  - It was straight reputation not that his reputation should nt be what it is . But I m glad OBJ is playing . Can not wait .
- - Have you considered using a voice transformer 
  - Yes and no . I ca nt find a free one and I do nt know if would work with console gaming .

- - Dude this is nt a field report . This is an IM conversation in which you misread her attempt to network with you as sexual interest .
  - Uhhhhh  she volunteered the part about her bf breaking up with her and that she s got her own place now . That s a pretty big green light .
- - CLEAN  do nt sand or anything . A little bronze wool and oil will help with the rust but not damage the remaining finish on the steel .
  - currently using rags  gun oil and a nylon brush . going to get some brass wool at the hardware store tomorrow
- - Was this an official thing  or a sort of punishment for something 
  - probably because too many people were redeeming most likely but I have no idea

  - I always new account . Problem  I dont care .
- - I do nt really understand the point of filming it .
  - it s obvious that he is addressing the gang members ... so that s the point .

  - Oh no  that snow has feelings too 
- - We need to stop running short little screens and running the ball . They are nt giving Lindley any confidence . Time to test by fire .

- - We do have adjective order rules  but they seem to be the same as in English . At least I am not aware of any difference .
  - Well  thanks . This makes my life easier .
- - Well  it s Lego the Game  with some RPG thrown in . How could it not sell tens of millions 
  - It s really not lego the game though  and saying it s RPG would be a complete lie .

  - well if you want to trade a Rockstar for a Roman I would be up to that .
  - I would do that  trade my Roman Commander for your rockstar .
- - It s not that cold is contagious but our bodies temperatures are controlled by us . Thats like saying breathing speed is contagious .
  - Pretty sure pulse rate is for people with mutual attraction .
- - The Lamb of God eating the lamb of God  Cannibalism 
  - I think I might ve actually liked church as a child if we got lamb instead of that shitty bread .
- - You can only add one of them to your cart  once you purchase it you get the other one automatically .
  - Thanks  ir appears now on my download list .
- - That s false equivalence . There is a big difference between some people bitching and some people shooting .
  - i find it funny how quickly the christians forget about things like abortion clinic bombings etc .
- - That could potentially attract more from the swarm above . I personally would nt risk it .
  - Perhaps . Most likely  even . But if I was dying of thirst in my basement  and it was death either way ... Eh  nothing ventured
- - Oh wait lol I just realised wrong sub lol . I knew that was going to happen . I shall PM you 
  - Lol  I ll step out here and let you guys work out your exchange

  - literally same thing happened to me too man . This seems to work .
- - Yeah I was hoping to get them used and save a little money but I m probably gon na end up ordering one . Thanks though 
  - I understand  I was really looking at one but then talked myself out of it 
- - So you re ignorant  then . Ok .
  - If you think Aikido has any value  except as a means to scam people  you re the ignorant one .
  - That guy seems to find some value  even if it s not fighting - what do you care what they do with their time 
  - Because they re scamming people who think they ll learn how to fight .
- - I ve always wanted a Shiba so badly  now I m afraid if I get one people will think it s just because of the meme . They so cute though
  - Memes are really limiting the things I can do in life as well .
- - Something is nt right about this picture ... but I ca nt put my finger on it .
  - Hope it does nt take you too long to finger it out .
- - Xapo is tied in with Coinbase or Circle . But when you read the fine print on them all there limits are small .
  - If the risk is too high for insurance  it s probably also too high for users .
- - Would you trade the HTC for a vita slim 
  - No thanks  only looking for cash

- - People are discussing the music ... what s the problem 
  - The body of discussion posts ca nt just be links to music streams . There needs to be prompt for the discussion .
- - Amongst the other comments  always remember . It is not the art  it is the artist
  - It s the artist if the art is terrible  it s the art if the art is good .
- - This is a dangerous comparison . You ca nt label voices of dissent to be enemy s position .
  - What if the voice of dissent is somehow identical to the enemy s position 
- - Running man  Only in Korea can you see a popular television host and top actress play games like these . Love it

  - Felt forced  No way . Felt awesome
- - I wonder if that score on the website applies equally to the UK branch - do you know

  - Lol when I said I had never had it my boyfriend bought me a small jar and he started an addiction xD
- - What clear attempt  All I know of is For Glory and ranked match making is nt much of bridge to competitive play .
  - It s more than we ve ever had . And do nt forget Nintendo sponsoring big tourneys . Or the coming online tournaments  for that matter .

  - I ve never even seen one in real life other than toys .
- - Make myself a genius  billionaire  playboy philanthropist . I will be cruel but fair with my god powers after that .

  - It was the first day back from winter break . I do nt really blame her either .
- - Or threads like this where one player is in a bout of poor form and people want him gone . Where are all the Ash and Toni haters  Fickle minds .
  - Exactly  same people probably campaigning for the return of Nani as well .

  - I really do nt know . He was even re-elected later .
- - Shit we got the same gear lol  trying to get the actual belt and shoes for the set but they wont drop .
  - Same  but I like the look of the non-standard set pieces better anyway  and I like that it makes this transmog slightly distinct from the usual Maraad look .
- - Because tagging someone on facebook only requires typing even just part of their name  click and you re done . They are nt typing out all those names .
  - However you can edit it to only show the first name  but it s annoying and just takes more time .
- - You re not volunteering if you get paid
