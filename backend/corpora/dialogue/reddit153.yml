  - Then he throws it more than five yards .
- - One question that stands out to me is whether or not your YouTube channel is monetized .
  - I do nt have any plans to monetize these videos . I only want traffic to push future novels on Amazon .
  - Suspense  dude  you want other people to voice act your stories for free  for your own personal marketing gains 
  - I was nt going to point it out ; I was just going to quietly not offer to voice things .
- - I actually thought this was pretty sweet . Everyone knows she s wasted but it  a damn wedding and you just laugh about it and show her the video later .
  - I agree . She actually did really well for being bombed out of her mind . If anything  being that drunk  her compliments and well-wishes were more sincere .
- - Are you on NA servers  If so I would be very interested

  - I understand . It does nt make it easier that people re upload them on YouTube  so it appears new

  - I m glad you made that clarification .

- - Bucks vs. NAO would be money tho ...

- - I did nt ask for excuses  I asked for Google Fiber 
  - Fiber is coming pretty fast  especially considering all the opposition Google faces .
- - Then why are nt more of these people crying out in protest when shit like this happens 
  - Because they know what it looks like .
- - Dude  lol dont pity yourself to try and get a card . Its not going to work .
  - Yes  that s what I was doing and you totally saw through it . serious

  - Hey  that contains all the vital elements necessary for proper respiration  and then some  That s a pretty thoughtful gift .
- - That s the approach I ve been taking so far  I m just afraid it s not sinking in .
  - Other than that  I ve got nothing man . This is not something I m looking forward to figuring out when I have kids . Best of luck .

- - Damn . This game looks fun as tits to play .
  - It s a lot of fun but it s freakin hard man
- - Would mind sharing which model you purchased  I m moving in a couple months and want to check them out .
  - Lowest price queen model  I bought a memory foam topper separate
- - This is nt what caused the deaths .
  - The first part is still a valid answer . Nongs going .
- - Except for the fact that the advice is wrong . You do nt qualify for PR yet .
  - Not saying he ll get it but the minimum stay requirements are just guidelines  MOJ has full discretion when awarding visas . In his case circumstances are unusual .

  - That s exactly why this cartoon is obviously about poor people and not necessarily those who live in greater Sydney
- - He s really unprofessional to say the least . He takes jabs at OG and their fanbase all the time  prob jealousy
  - Straight up jealously tbh . OpTic is exactly what he wishes NV was .
- - Everything from the studs out is taken care of . Landscaping  roof  brick repair  paint  drive  etc .
  - Bingo . Too bad foundation and AC are nt taken care of . Take a wild guess what I ve had to fix over the years ...
- - i admit the service hasnt been stellar  but they also have massive overhead with their server networks . its not like they are getting all that money as straight profit
  - We re paying for a product we re not getting  that s the problem .
- - I like how it s simple . Something that can actually pass as a nice industrial grade skin as opposed to all these crazy covert level skins people come up with .
  - Thanks  I did nt want to overcomplicate it .
- - I think most people support what the mayor told his kids . I m white and my parents have taught me a similar thing about cops .
  - I mentioned how cops should earn respect and Facebook swooped down on me like a hobo on a ham sandwich
- - My advice is always google and YouTube any tech problem before calling support . You re likely to find the answer much faster .

  - Someone who stabbed someone to death and then showed no remorse after the fact  going to far as to smirk at the victim s family .
- - Abortion . I was totally against it until I started having sex regularly as a teenager .
  - That s like having an opinion on a type of food without tasting it .
- - The update says presents will stop spawning . Does that also mean Christmas trees will stop spawning 
  - Yes  trees have stopped spawning as well .
- - True  but I m sure this moron THOUGHT he knew it was plenty deep . But he pays the price
  - Or his friend egged him on a bit . Honestly  it probably did nt cross either of their minds .
- - My daughter loves horses and now she wants your horse .
  - His name is Elliott . Foxy and Batman were getting water at the time . She is welcome to Elliott  he s a butthead .

- - Ooooooh you mean because of the holohoax 
  - Oh  you did nt get it because you re trying to be a douche  not because you did nt know . Right . Got me good .
- - I do nt think Willie is that high on Kass . Would nt be surprised if he got traded .
  - I do nt think AV or Tortellini were too high on him either . Kind of makes you wonder if Kassian will ever put it together .
- - I wonder what the littering charges would be for doing that in NYC . Probably six concurrent life sentences and a couple trips to the gas chamber .
  - Good thing the police is on a strike and protesting .
- - Swans are known assholes . I m not surprised .

- - A lot of people on my TL are whining because of how late this game is going .
  - dont let those people into your life .
- - That sounds like something out of a shitty tourist bar in Tijuana  not a place in the US
  - I ve heard multiple people say that about Bourbon Street . It s common
- - What country do you have in mind 
  - I was thinking Germany . David is always complaining that there is not Germany player .

  - Do nt like my comment  Why not just use your mod powers and delete it  Oh ... Wait ...
- - I thought that black holes had such a strong gravity that it did nt allow light to escape so how there can be light in the centre of the milky way 
  - There is a limit to that strength though . It s only strong enough to prevent light from escaping at its event horizon . Light can escape beyond that point .

  - He s taken special effort to suppress his origins  but regardless  he d underestimate a muggle weapon .

  - In it for the long con  I see .
- - I want to lick your knuckle hair .
  - Eww  I ve always been pleased that I do nt have knuckle hair  but never moreso than now .
