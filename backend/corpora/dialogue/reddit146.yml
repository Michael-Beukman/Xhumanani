  - Because Szczesny has the decision making of almunia at best .
- - That it has not collapsed into chaos .
  - With so much diversity  I believe it will . Sooner or later .
- - How anyone of working age could possibly think this would be a good introduction to a professional resume is beyond me .
  - I work in recruitment  this is better than a third of the stuff I see .
- - None of them are elementary schoolers though .
  - To be fair  the word elementary was nt used  and little is a bit arguable

  - Accel is around Touma s age I think .

  - Meh . Karma does nt mean jack .

  - I think you may have read the chart wrong . That is a deficiency chart ... So if your plants may be lacking enough magnesium .
- - Voiding photographers sounds painful but  assuming John Mayer is well endowed  I suspect you were up for the task .
  - Haha if only it was John Mayer  what a bloody stud .
- - There are still good people in this world - like OP who made up a nice story for us to read .
  - I left the note  True story .
- - I like how he just accepted his fate  as if a dick pic is just an honest mistake .
  - It s like oh I messed up . yep block time ...
- - They are going to run all day  goddamn we need Terry Williams for this game .
  - yeah cause now we re weak on the end too
- - Every comment you have made here today has been arrogant as fuck .
  - I have some difficulties interacting with a low iq crowd  it tries one s patience to its limits .
- - There is this guy called Eminem . He seems pretty good .
  - woah  never heard of him . I ll give him a listen .
- - So basically treat yourself like a glorified intern until that last day 
  - Make him like you until you begin the heel turn .
- - He s looked really good today outside of that fumble though .
  - I guess so  he s team really has nt helped him out so much today either .
- - So she s forcing you to save half your money  not taking it per say .
  - Yes  but she wo nt let me save it for myself . She does nt trust me .
- - I hated Albert and I might still hate him for how damn hairy his body is and how bald his head is .
  - But seriously  how are you gon na be all hairy and then have a clean shaven head  He looked like a tiny penis hiding in the pube bush .
- - You use a plastic spoon  Lol .
  - plastic stays cleaner since i dont need to heat my gear .
- - Why do you think you re different over text as opposed to Skype or in person  Why do you think you need a visual medium  Are you Carrot Top 
  - Autistic people do nt know how to appropriate their actions and demeanor without expression and verbal affect .
- - I always check out other people s recent posts when they comment on mine . Glad I could offer some feedback .
  - Ha  I did nt think posting on a Tinder post would have resulted in getting some help on my resume . Glad you did 
- - Hooooo boy it s going to be tough to beat the Russians AND the Refs .
  - That s a clear penalty  how do you blame the refs for that one  Blame the lack of discipline from the Canadians .
- - Tell him to include his gamertag as part of the deal  other than that those games are useless to you .
  - They re useless even if the Gamertag is included
- - Way to be a friendzoning whore . I do NOT tip mfedora at you .
  - LOL  I do have some nerve .
- - Keep in mind we ve had some pretty big holidays  it ll take more time to compile everything because of that
  - True  people do have lives and families and all  makes sense then
- - Sorry if this is a stupid question  but what is a male lesbian 
  - I do nt know . Chris was hugely transphobic in the past  so he s probably working out some gender issues .
- - Poe looks amazing on you . I hope you showed it off  It s out of stock every where here .
  - Thank you  I got it online with a gift card but in stores I have nt seen it .
- - Destro locks got nerfed  I had to change some of what I did to get DPS up again .
  - What things did you have to change 
- - Selective enforcement  the hallmark of the corrupt .
  - Well  it s selective enforcement if it s still up in its current state next week . These things ... they take time .
- - Is it just me or the graphics card look like its somewhat outta the socket 
  - Probably being weighed down by the copious amount of dust bunnies taking refuge on top of it .
- - That Naga skin is so perfect . I really hope it ends up cheap .
  - I might have to retire my ST Heirloom
- - And charge them with what  Delay of flight 
  - the same thing everyone else is charged with who interferes with a flight .
- - I was still talking about Batman Forever  I did nt see you had started talking about Batman and Robin . Batman and Robin is bad  I just misread your comment
  - I did like Batman Forever  it has it s charms . Far from perfect though .
- - It s probably time for Marvin to be done as HC of this team .
  - Hue can go to buffalo too . Game plan today has been horrible .
  - I do nt blame hue  he has Andy to work with  it s not like we can rely on his arm .
  - I blame Andy and Hue . It s a combination of shitty QB play and shitty play calling . This is not fun .
- - I m a ginger ... So yeah ... all of them .
  - Really  Even the one that says that gingers get really attractive after puberty 
- - The hardest loss in recent memory . So dissapointed by the Lions . They had them beat in the first half and gave up in the second half .
  - I do nt know that they gave up . Shitty calls can make you lose momentum really quick .
- - I m sure there are a few I m better off forgetting but I m worried that I m forgetting some of the fun ones 
  - You never forget the really fun ones .
- - Qlis are the only new archetype I really like  their art is fantastic .
  - i agree . i love scouts flavour text
- - That sounds vaguely sexist Captain ... Let me have a chat with SMA and Gen. O and I ll get back to you .
  - You know what they say  an elephant never forgets .
- - Just traded for him  wish the trade went through before tonight 
  - Who d you give up for him 
  - John Wall and Joakim Noah for him and Klay Thompson
  - If u dont need the assists thats a nice trade
- - Something else that is also good for small game is a slingshot  adaptable to multiple types of ammo  same amount of noise as an airgun .
  - really cheap to stockpile a lifetime supply of the slingshot key ingredient ... athletic exercise stretch tubing - even better than surgical tubing
- - Finals MVP I believe is Scotty Pippen . The man was a lock down defender and a great offensive option .
  - A lot of people were good when MJ was playing . But MJ was that much better than everyone so he ended up winning it .
- - have you tried telling him to shut the fuck up about Stanford 
  - Yes  actually . He takes it real personally and cries .
  - Do it a lot and maybe he ll leave you alone .
  - Stop . Did you know most Stanford alumnus already leave OP alone . Okay . Continue .
- - Give Mana Potion by Vapor Trails NW a shot
  - Seems like an interesting blend of flavors on that one . I will probably grab a bottle of that and their Highwind a go after the next pay day .
- - Could you add me too please  Also  if you could tell me my pokemon that would be awesome .
  - yup  You have Fighting with Mienfoo  and Pancham

- - You have a lot to learn  friend .
  - That s why the post is removed right  Since this was so RP and such a learning experience 
- - I m disappointed we did nt get an episode where we got to see how he lived .
  - He should have gotten a spinoff series .
- - Thanks  I will keep that in mind . How do you track macros from dinner that you ve already eaten  Do you make an estimation or something 
  - Yeah just make a solid estimate . I always aim to slightly overestimate as well  cause screw unnecessary fat gain .
- - That s fucking brilliant . Where did you get the inspiration 
  - I found very similar shelves on Etsy and Pinterest .
- - In all honesty ... why not John wall 
  - If the wizards end up at the top of the east then definitely .
- - Which English club has the highest number of consecutive consonants in its name 
  - After watching the FA cup is it Blyth 
- - You do nt really want lifesteal on Axe . You lifesteal off of auto attacks and Axe does nt build damage items . . P
  - Okay so no Satanic  but that still leaves Halberd and Reaver on the board . Or AC for that matter .
- - Man those guys sucked real bad . Still a sweet video .
  - Seriously bad players . I would assume this was from placement games .
- - I get that people like different things  and that s cool  but people also like bad things  and I think woody is one of them .
  - You did nt get my point . It is nt in any way inherently bad  it s your opinion that it s bad .
- - Will there ever be a hardcover book 
  - I hope  That would likely require being noticed by a publisher  but as of now it s very indie .
- - I want to participate  I only have two completed trades . Have experienced trader that will rep my character . Let me know ...
  - Talked to your trader - your in 
- - I like a nice cold glass of milk after peanut butter toast
  - That sounds awesome  you should look into honey roasted peanut butter  some stores make them in house . It s a game changer

  - Before or after going no contact  getting a lawyer  and hitting the gym 
  - Go no contact with your gym after hitting your lawyer .
  - You are a lovely person  Thank you for this bit of humor .
- - Well  we d all be dead .
  - Well  we d probably never be alive in the first place .
- - yeah  could not remember password and the email i used to set it up no longer exists .
  - Shitty  The same thing almost happened to my steam account but miraculously remembered the password .
- - Turn off throttle decay in the menu so you dont have to have foward pressed to keep moving . No idea about joysticks or track ir .
  - That setting is off . It s like the game ignores the throttle axis and starts thinking it s centered . Does nt matter if it is pushed forward or not .
- - The fact that the store owner was so smooth and fearless should have made the criminal piss his pants and beg for his life .
  - and bc the clerk is so cool - he would only have broken his nose
- - I enjoy dancing  swimming  sleeping  food  sometimes biology  sometimes chemistry  and traveling . I m graduating this year and thinking about school stresses me out .
  - School is always stressful  Just try and find what your passion is and pursue it  You mentioned science  maybe something in that field 
- - That s close . The one angle makes it look like a TD  though .
  - One of the least close things I have seen to be honest . Was a clear TD .
- - so pretty much like the secret task forces that most - if not all - powerful nations have 
  - the US does this ... and I believe Russia has been caught in some acts of fuckery as well ... but who else we talking about 
- - bullshit . Big Bang s album releases are like Final Fantasy XV .
  - Remake of FFVII . Fans want to throw their money at Squeenix . Squeenix says we do nt want your money .
- - Thanks for the awkward trip down memory lane .
  - Haha why awkward  That s just the first thing that popped into my head when he said that he broke a medicine cabinet with one punch .
- - Yeah because straight people never stop using condoms and never cheat either .
  - Is that what you think I said  Because that s not what I said .
- - You need more mass  what are your macros  Also  unless you physically ca nt  you should probably still deadlift . It really helped my forearms and traps
  - I do nt think trap development will be an issue if he s oly lifting
- - Jesus man . They are literally groping you .
  - Cause Jesus he knows me  and he knows I m right .
- - I understand it  it s not that hard . Are you too simple to understand simple concepts 
  - red pillers seem to be based on the differences in opinion and debates on the topic . are you in denial about that 
- - Eastern Washington University has mens and womens hockey .
  - That s a club it s not sanctioned .
- - Were there any open carry activists there to espouse how armed good guys could have saved the day 
  - Classy . I just wish your keyboard had armed good guys to protect us from you .
- - The guy could have a good tolerance  act drunk after a few drinks and give bullshit info to save his own ass .
  - Keep giving him drinks until he passes out . Then use his last testimony .
- - I think you should find another church  this one clearly does nt fit you . Try meditating for a while  look into yourself and see what you really believe .
  - I am not sure I understand your point .
- - Hey chocolate bear  how s the golf coming  Any courses you can recommend 
  - like everyone else  i suck at golf but it s coming along ... I m a course hopper right now .
- - How many miles any mods  Do rip on it alot  Sorry for asking im afraid of this myself .
  - Get better oil if you re afraid and do nt boost it till oil is at temp . get a better tune .
- - Zak said he thinks it s rude to ask to join back and would prefer if Guude invited him instead .
  - Again I know it s the ment of not actually staying on
- - Probably over two million  actually . France set the fire and we doused it with gasoline .
  - France left . No  one forced the U.S to stay and go crazy .
- - Please do this OP . If you do nt  I will .
  - Ha ha  please do if they do nt 
- - Is it really a norm to wash your fucking hair every single day  No way .
  - No its not . every other day maybe depending on the oils
- - I would have been fine with him getting a massage .
  - But would you have felt guilty later if you gave him a handjob 
- - Channels retuning was needed for new year s . I did nt even bothered doing it . Crap tv series where romance is always the main plot or cheap comedies ...
  - What I saw was a lot of weird movies  porn and political panel shows . Always political panel shows . And other than that  football  netball and motorsports .
- - If you look up the chronic stress and its relation to cortisol  you realize that maybe dodging sabre tooth tigers is better for you than status report meetings .
  - I was nt arguing against that  just suggesting that acute and chronic stress have different effects on the body .
- - I can certainly follow programming logic  so that s good to hear . I do nt know anything about CPP  so maybe I ll look into that
  - Its just c plus plus sorry if thats unclear .
- - put it in your will bud  lawyers handle that shit
  - If it is nt specified what I want done will my family be able to do whatever they want 
  - My great Uncle put it in his will  Now he s at Stanford As a cadaver .
  - That s what I d like to be done .
- - It must have taken a lot of discipline and patience to bring the dog to that level .
  - Yes  this is all about the hardwork of trainer and intelligence of the dog .
- - Want some caviar to go with that 
  - Sure  It ll be interesting to see how good it tastes when high .
- - Damn good choice  Welcome  If you have a look at our vendors side bar you should be able to get a good price too  Where are you based 
  - I m from the USA but currently living as an expat in a small town in Hungary .
- - Never ever even once considered carbon blade outside of a joke build . It s an incredibly bad skill  both the basic and the aced version .
  - This . Just use the Loco as a secondary and leave long-range threats for your teammates  or use an SMG .
- - Your lack of mod flair despite you speaking as a mod confuses me .
  - check the side bar . I am a mod . Is this better 
- - Wait  you can go into a job knowing you ca nt work after a certain time period and then still collect unemployment  You repeat this process yearly 
  - heck i just found out my buddy got unemployment for the one week his company shut down over the holidays
- - True . And your life experiences will serve to help you guide her  and hopefully help her have an easier time of it . Congratulations on becoming a parent btw 
  - Thanks  it s nerve wracking  but I m ready 
- - It is rare I am in a hotel that has good wifi speed on their own network . Now they want to block everyone elses  Wow  that s balls .
  - Seriously . I would nt need to use my phone as a mobile hot spot if it was possible to get any serious work done on a typical hotel WiFi network .
- - Saw some videos on your blog -- I m intrigued  but I m currently in China  Could you post a link  Thanks  looking forward to it 
  - I m guessing there s no China link  then  Any chance you could send me a pdf copy or the likes  Let me know  still interested 
- - Though some of those are useless in singel player .
  - Only force gamemode  PVP  and spawn protection distance  and those are useful on LAN servers .
- - Do you swim  You should start to . Turn it into a positive .
  - Guys my alopecia is nt the problem in real world . Just asking how should I act while using dating sites
- - Hear hear . Just started working in Brisbane . No animal encounters at work yet though .
  - Same here but I reckon as long as there s no drop bear infestation  we ll be fine .
- - Achilles should stomp . He technically can not be harmed outside of his heel and without divine intervention or a stray shot from Legolas  nobody is aiming for his ankles .
  - According to the OP  this is movie Achilles  who was vulnerable everywhere but initially hurt in the ankle .
- - This is the top post in this sub ...
  - She sucked away all of op s dignity .
- - I ve never had a problem with gyfcat posts before . Yours seems to be the only one I ve ran into that Baconreader is nt able to load .
  - Weird  I just removed the markup from the original giant link .
- - I wonder how long it took you to type all of that .
  - Home sick  today . It was awhile .
- - Wow . What is happening to our city 
  - Nothing is happening to our city . Statistically we re one of the safest cities around .
- - So are you selling your own lube and cutting your own stickers as well 
  - Maybe  it depends on the demand .
- - Yep . Two step then partner dances . Imagine the awkwardness that is picking a partner in front of everyone .
  - i ve never heard of dance being part of gym class
- - Even the one you provided is missing the diamond at the top  which is the most important part of it .
  - What diamond  And why is the diamond important 
- - We only wanted a few systems  so we do nt have a big enough cluster to show up on the influence map ; that s not particularly uncommon .
  - How tight is the control in those systems  Regular friendly roamers keeping watch  Or POS defense 
- - The episode called White Bear of Black Mirror is definitely worth checking out .
  - The Entire History of You was really good  too .
- - Probably to do with the time at which it was broadcast . If I remember correctly  it used to be on well before the watershed .
  - Aye  that might rise a few Daily Mail Eyebrows if it where on before six or seven OClock
- - Cool gearbox  Where do you guys store your gear  Is it worth keeping in a small refrigerator 
  - I keep it in my box . The end
- - This is the gimmick he needs . Be a fucking celtic warrior not just some Irish guy who likes to fight .
  - Exactly . We already had an Irish guy who LOVED to fight
- - Oh I did not know about that . I ll take the warrior as I have fought a scout and I am not yet ready to fight a fellow Mage .
  - OK  let s do it . Start a new top-level post with your initiative roll .
- - Assuming the glass is strong enough to survive the pressure from space  the fish would be swimming in water  not space .
  - I took the question to mean if he somehow just had a ball of water with a fish in it .
- - I ca nt recall a single AAA game that meaningfully used Kinect . I do nt see why it s any more dead now than it was before .
  - Alien Isolation was pretty cool with Kinect .
- - Amazing punt and the flag s on them
  - Did not expect that . Usually when something goes so well for one them and there s a flag  it completely ruins the good thing .
- - It s right side up when you re drinking .
  - You ca nt expect fellow drunks to be able to read it otherwise ...
- - I wonder how many years you d get there on your first cannabis possession charge  What a joke .
  - Zero . You d get a ticket  as long as it s under an ounce or something . Weed is decriminalized here .
- - An ID is literally anything given to you by an official organization with your name and a picture of you on it . A country counts as an official organization .
  - Yeah  but I guess the issue is will museums count it as proof of SD residence .
- - Larry Foote did some great things for us .
  - He has done really well for the cardinals too
- - Got ta love when even the commentator ca nt help but shout YES  
  - The audio is from the packers radio .
- - Is that a Kripp snowchugger on his shirt 
  - It s amazing and I need it but it s like nowhere on the internet
- - What a terrible call coming out of a time out . Great defensive call by Notre Dame .
  - Did anybody not think it was going to Paige  And running him to the sideline with no time or room to maneuver  Just garbage .
- - How about you figure out what you think and not rely on the rest of the internet to make your decisions .
  - I am not asking the internet what I d like to have for dinner . Just curious what folks who visit this page think . It s not a decision .
- - You have nt unlocked it yet because the story line has nt touched on it yet . Wait until you get to the Chamber of Secrets .
  - Good points . I guess I got ahead of myself . I ve been meaning to work on my patience .
- - Is ... is he even alive  
  - What would it take to get a reaction out of him
- - I had a dream where this game ended with FSU losing due to OPI . Sweet karma
  - I mean as long as we do nt commit OPI then we ll be good .
- - Wow . Someone needs to learn how to venture .
  - Or Prospect  since covert cloak is nice in wormholes
- - You can also press the home button . When you go back there will have been a communication fault message and you ll be disconnected .
  - That works too . I think it is just preference between the wireless switch and the home button .
- - Nice body man . Just wondering . Have you got pectus excavatum  Where your chest goes a little inward 
  - I ve not heard that from any of my doctors  but I guess it s possible  Haha
- - Dean Ambrose is part of the lunatic fringe as opposed to the lunatic mainstream .
  - Oooooh that s why he and Wyatt are feuding . Wyatt represents the lunatic mainstream . He once even started a lunatic club . Thanks for the clarification
- - The fuck is that look on scar s face 
  - In the thumbnail  I do nt think that s Scar  some other character from the sequel probably .
- - I ca nt wait  My very first contest 
  - Just in time  We re starting to keep track of total scores this year 
- - Macarena -- as we lay our dear friend to rest  let s all do the Macarena
  - Personally  I m going to put it in my will that everyone has to do the macarena at my funeral .
- - Was the fish in a bag ... or ... 
  - nope Just the fish no bag  and it was cut open with the guts leaking outside .
- - Holy crap I have nt seen jobbers on smackdown since RYBACK was eating them .
  - In five years  that guy could be the company s new Dean Ambrose .
- - That s brit  We Americans use that to mean peace as well . I ve seen a lot of Chinese use it too
  - Yeah  I ve no idea what that guy means other than that .
- - I accidentally giftapult wrapped a strange snack attack I was holding on to . I am not sure whether to actually gift it out or not .
  - Yeah  but do it when I m online .
- - Bow hunting is really cruel . Gun is much more humane
  - Why  Sorry I genuinely do nt know  do nt both of them just put holes in an animal till it dies

  - I hate seeing goalies get pulled so early in that has to be soul crushing
- - I see you revised the question . If four people are together in a party you ca nt get banned .
  - then they were not in a party but they kicked me i dont understand how i can get a ban cause they kicked me it is bullshit
- - I m guessing you do nt go to many parties haha
  - I think you forgot what site you re on
- - Yeah  I see a lot of people being quick to make this a sexist issue without much substance the claim .
  - I guess the lived experiences of nearly all women in the field do nt count  How exactly do you substantiate your claim to the contrary 
- - Strictly speaking it is discrimination . However the scales are so very heavily weighed in favour of men you d be a total asshole to complain about it .
  - You wan na go ahead and name one instance in which women are discriminated against in corporate America 
- - So all those ads on backpage that say nothing illegal will be done meant just the opposite 
  - People can go to regular massage therapists for cheaper and not on backpage if nothing illegal were really going to be done .
- - Thank you NBC for the slightly misleading headline . On another note  I wonder if she realized the absurdity of the situation while she was dying ...
  - Only after reading your comment did I really understand that it was a car without a driver  not a self driving car ...
- - It s a flippant answer  yes . But to a question anyone with half a brain knows the answer to . What s the point 
  - Oh lord . So this place sucks too huh  Sigh .
- - I can positively confirm the other two responders  speculation that the streaming videos are  in fact  stored on a server onboard the plane .
  - You sound pretty certain . How are you so certain 
- - Tell the best story you can tell . You ll get criticized no matter what you do  so trying to check off boxes will invariably make your story worse .
  - If you start now you could make a killing selling books with no words 
- - can you find all the Steve Jobs hidden in these photos 
  - Lol  it s a single book my wife gave me  it is not meant to be featured in the photos  Nice to see people are looking close .

  - Oh my . I never noticed that . Thanks 
- - At first I thought typo but then I realized fuck you .
  - ahh come on you only leaf once .
- - i love how it makes you realize how in depth they went with the combat system ...
  - Too bad they did nt go in depth with the hitboxes
- - Our DJ is the bomb . Except for that goal song . It s terrible .
  - I do nt even know what the goal song is ...
  - I ca nt even remember what it sounds like . I think I ve just blocked it out at this point .
  - Did nt it used to be Gold on the Ceiling 
- - ppl shit on anyone doing bad not just junglers
  - In most of my games it seems that all you have to do is blame you jungler for lack of ganks and then it s my fault .
  - I get blamed even if i am doing well tho
  - Same here I do nt get what harassing someone will do for you and your team
- - Please report it to the police . The police do nt know where they need to patrol if they do nt have accurate numbers on where the problems are occurring
  - I second this . They wo nt be able to do anything about what happened but at least it will keep them with future situations .
- - freedom of expression does nt equal freedom from retaliation
  - Why would you defend murder  What s wrong with you 
- - They are nt left wing . They are small government libertarians that are massive right wing on social issues . There is literally nothing left wing about that .
  - That s preposterous  have nt you seen the results of that online survey that showed they were predominantly right-wing  Irrefutable proof of their leftist leanings 
- - How important are quests  Should I accept most of the ones offered  Should that be my primary source for trying to level up and ally with a faction 
  - Yes  you should . They allow you to get better reputation with people which helps when you want them to do your bidding .
- - Then MacGyver cured his glaucoma with a matchbook  two paperclips  and a fruit roll-up .
  - There were some things even Macgyver could nt fix
- - In regards to MiL there is a little bit of truth in every stereotype
  - And a little bit of stereotype in every truth .

  - And make the Neighbor lady horny for your Husband .
- - That was some embarrassing goal line blocking on an obvious run play .
  - Seemed to play the play-action there . DeAndre Levy was just chilling back there
- - He calls his penis Mike Smith  always trying to get it to settle down

  - They both do have one  Zgs  tentacle whip  topaz e bolts

- - Haha my boyfriend says the same thing 
  - When you give a blow job  do you swallow his load ever 
- - Would you like a small  medium  or large with your happiness 
  - They are all amazing in their own way
- - And apparently the same idiots who did an interview with the media .
  - Video link please this is too good to be true .
- - I did nt realize it was a joke . I m a Celsius boy . I apologize and redact .
  - I m jealous . Celsius makes more sense .
- - Pistons fan  Never would have guessed .
  - Yeah  it s hard to tell without one of those fancy logos next to my name .

  - it s not like you re the Ducks or anything .
- - the people in games and gaming are mostly sympathetic to GG it s the mods and admins shutting down discussion .
  - Almost everyone is sympathetic to what GG Is for . They re not sympathetic for the things done in GGs name .
- - What kind of force are we talking about to open it  I wpuld hope its quite robust .
  - I can twirl the pen by the leather strap attached to the pen and it does nt come off .

  - Oh wise master  thank you for your guidance .
- - found a pair of kicks there in my size  and I need to know whether to cop or na
  - They seem legit to me . No funny business like rare Jordan s full size run . You should be okay . Check the return policy just in case tho
- - I hear moose bites can be quite nasty .
  - We apologise for the fault in the thread . Those responsible have been sacked .
- - We agree . Ryan has a proven track record and will be a great moderator for this .
  - Not the track record you re looking for
- - Yes . Then again  I always say that when this topic comes up  and no one follows up on it .
  - Well  now s as good a time as any to start .
- - Norway is smaller than London  I thought they had a ton of oil money .
  - GDP is not the same as money saved up .

- - they are supposed to taste earthy  not worth it IMHO
  - i see  thanks for letting me know
- - My original post said that only the bus driver was killed  but it was actually the rear-ending truck driver who died .
  - It must have been someone else s comment . I saw somewhere in the thread where someone stated both drivers died and now I ca nt find it .
- - Owl my god the comments at imgur are nothing but puns .
  - I m not impressed by owl of them  but some are funny
- - At what point do you split them so some are facing across the street  I want a tram system as well as other vehicles on it .
  - I like the layout where you can see all the buildings  but I have considered putting the two corner on Town Hall and going out from there
- - Jesus Christ . If you were to take his name off of it you d probably think he was some crazy uneducated Tea Partier by half of his tweets .
  - He s desperately trying too hard to be edgy these days
- - Did you not read my comment  I am here on behalf of my taste buds . They ca nt read .
  - I forgive your taste buds for they love what I love .
- - I assumed Kido would count as magic though .
  - Maybe  If it does  does that mean Aizen could block magic using reiatsu as well 
- - Yes  never trust a man again based on the actions of one . Seems pretty fair to me .
  - My point was that my judgement was so far off with this person that I no longer trust it .
- - One character on a journey to avoid getting crushed by falling rocks .
  - I m not sure what to say about this one . Yeah . Not sure at all .
- - That game will suck hard if you do nt like football .
  - Why  Plenty of people just enjoy the gameplay .
- - Bengals secondary is holding up nicely considering their DL is not helping them out at all .
  - not really  this game would be a blowout if we didnt keep dropping easy catches .
  - By drops you mean . The ball knocked out by nearby DBs .
  - ya thats what im seeing some of these colts fans are delusional
- - Heads up - this is actually like the top post on the sub at the moment .
  - Thanks for the heads up . I ll remove it

  - Awesome  What colors do you have in mind  Would love to see it too 
- - That was a fucking ugly sequence of events
  - I m gon na need them to button up on some of these break outs from the defensive zone .
- - STOP DRINKING SYRUP . IT S A WASTE OF ENERGY AND IS NOT HEALTHY OR FRUGAL
  - Lol ... uhhh ... THANK YOU . I WILL TRY TO ENJOY LIFE LESS .
- - You know if Adrian is cut or released Jerry will go after him .
  - I agree  and i would support that decision depending on the price .
- - He makes a very good point . I do nt see why you would have a problem with it . If you want cheap products you go online .
  - The point is  I am a customer and I asked something . He could reply without sounding like a twat .
- - Wow . Again we are going after our competition for key hires . Next up is KIFFIN  Just kidding . I hope .
  - You guys are going to be unstoppable by the time we get to play you ...
- - Awwww  I wish mine looked that cute when he came back .
  - Ask for a puppy cut  This is what my groomers does when we ask for it .

- - I thought if was going to be Homers make up gun
  - You ve got it set on whore .

  - Fair enough . I planned on having a mini party by my lonesome . Maybe spike my own coffee .
- - That s assuming the universe itself is nt moving . The real answer is nt just objective and completely answerable .
  - I m not sure what you mean . Why would it matter if the universe was moving 
- - Why do you only notice me when my posts get popular 
  - This seems like an interesting backstory  is it 
- - Do you have an idea how much they go for 
  - I think they go for pretty close to retail
  - Oh alright fam  there is a few on strictly supreme  but kinda rape prices
  - could you link me  I couldnt find any on there
- - So then you re just cool with this being crafted in secret eh  Because multinational corporations have never shafted us all before  am I right 
  - No they are all about the little people . Money trickles down and corporations have the US best interest at heart . They would not at all screw us .
- - The problem is that no one says pound town . It s quite the unbelievable story  no explanation will change that .
  - Wait until you re a parent . Euphemisms out the woohoo .
- - I would love to see this . There are no downsides that I can think of to this being implemented into the game .
  - Not a single one  plus it ll be great to see all the amazing final kills that people make .
- - Even as a Red Bulls fan  I would love to see Stevie G in MLS . However  I ca nt imagine Liverpool will part with him easily
  - I think if he wants to go they would let him go .
- - dont do business with friends never works out .
  - Normally I would completely agree with you on that . This is somebody I trust in this case though .
- - I think this roster is legit actually  unlike all the haters in this thread . New TL maybe 
  - TT is owned by the GG Agency . I do nt think it will be a new TL roster .
- - Safety is not what I was responding to .
  - You re trying to suggest something is a weapon that would cause more injury to the user then the victim . This is not what weapons do .
- - Cerrone spanked Jury for wasting his damn time .
  - And bullshitting him out of that sweet sweet bonus money .
- - It s not faking it if you deliver .
  - This should be on a plaque ... fantastic advice for anyone that is doubting themselves in the beginning of a new venture .
- - To each his own . Do nt have to be a cunt about it .
  - way to be late to the party 
- - When do room become available for renting like a hotel room 
  - A certain percentage of each resort is usually available for cash reservations .
- - Its not stealing if its still there afterwards  we do nt have a word for what it is yet .
  - Fine  we can invent a new word for it . It s still illegal and immoral .
  - Morals are set by society  considering lots of that society downloads things illegally  its not that immoral .
  - By that logic  in the past when most of society was racist  racism was not that immoral . See the problem with that line of thinking 
- - Like those episodes of Doctor Who that he appeared in .
  - Oh GOD yes  completely ruined those episodes  I do nt get why people ca nt wake up to his incompetence ...
- - That is too bad . Do we know if the Mods got cards for distribution already  Or are we out of luck 
  - Ca nt go into too much detail but we are in talks with some individuals and have secured some .
- - Would ve been a death stare if it was Kanye
  - I think kanye would love to take pics with people  then later photoshop his face on their face and now he has two kanyes .
- - But Zoro told Luffy about what he did during timeskip ...
  - Really  I do nt remember this ... D .
- - This is a penalty . Does nt matter if it is intentional or not .
  - Exactly . He blocked a shot on goal with his arm way up high nowhere near its natural position .
- - Martian colony . With black jack and hookers .
  - I d have a right bender there 
- - I went in last week  they still had things inside 
  - I drive by it every day for the past two months and it s been torn down .
- - Right  The crazy thing is that I stalked his history and he seems like a nice  normal  adult man in all of his posts and comments .
  - Those are the ones you got ta look at just a hair longer  just to make sure ...
- - It s not that defensive  more passive . Similar to good melee falcons the game is mostly about maneuvering and finding the right moment to attack .
  - Except without any of the combos that follow good Falcons choosing their moment
- - As much as I want to believe this  I need someone other than Thayer Evans to confirm it for me to trust it .
  - NewsOK has posted it also . But I do nt think that s the credible source you re looking for .
  - They re just reporting that SI reported it  so it s nothing new unfortunately .
  - NewsOK continues to roll on with credible sources .
- - Gundy  thats not your fault  grogan should hit that although tight angle on the right hash for a right footer is difficult
  - Gundy did nt miss the chip shot but he also did nt do everything he could to make the kick easier .
- - Thanks  I made it myself out of these leftover anvils .
  - No wonder we can get a move on .
- - Should I be concerned if I do nt get that text 
  - No  some women actually succeed at playing it cool .
- - Face to face . As I prefer to communicate with anyone .
  - Yeah  probably did nt need that qualifier .
- - I m from the UK  but it still identified me correctly as Birmingham  just the wrong one . P
  - I live in Birmingham  Alabama . Maybe our people are nt so different after all 
- - Why does nt college have a no advance on on a fumble rule 
  - Because it s more fun that way .
- - I think Carlisle is better at staggering rotations than anyone in the league .
  - its a discussion between him and pop s
- - This is great ; excellent vocal direction in the google doc . Ca nt wait to audition 
  - Thanks  We tried to be as clear as possible  haha . We look forwards to seeing your audition 
- - This is worst than the ND Alabama game
  - I AGREE LETS NEVER TALK ABOUT THAT GAME AGAIN .
- - I want to say Goes to London or Talking From The Box  leaning towards the former . Talking about the singer from Circle One  right 
  - it IS goes to london thanks very much 
- - Demon . Here to infiltrate the population with cat gifs .
  - What kind of demon  if you do nt mind me asking 
- - I basically get paid for the down time between calls that I would do for free .
  - HA this is the tits  I m going to use this .
- - The man beat Wawrinka i think he knows what he s doing
  - I m guessing you did nt watch the video
