  - Is nt the goal to get people to blow 
- - my real question is why didnt they do both at once 
  - because they want him out the whole year for tanking purposes .

  - He s called Pinhead you worthless shitstain .

  - You can already do pretty much all of that . I think the only expensive activity there is smashing the dishes ...
- - Why Edit . So apparently questioning his continuous call-ups is a big no-no in this sub .
  - I m going to go with because the coaching staff thinks he deserves to be there .
- - Sweden expresses some concern over the aggressive move  but  the Emperor would like to ask the Latvian government if they would like support .
  - Support would be greeted  but we do not need much . This is not a conquest war  this is a war to topple the current government .
- - not too much except i was nt constipated and was releasing Amul butter smooth tatti during that time .
  - I feel very active . Like I have so much more energy . My brain is not dull . Edit . Ca nt say it is a good thing .
- - He s definitely a lot better  but who is the dude who s almost as big as him and who seems to be on his side in some parts

  - Show me where I talked about the packers in this thread
- - Wild Gunman . I could get a crack shot on that game .
  - That one s boring  you have to play it with your hands .
- - All the taller players should just get kicked out of the league for being taller than the important players . Obviously .
  - I have a much more modest proposal for the shorter players ...
- - Everyone can now get username mentions even if you do nt have gold  If you do have gold you can now make a snoo avatar 
  - Wooo  BRB  just making my avatar 
- - I honestly ca nt tell if this is sarcasm or not ...
  - pretty sure it s sarcasm . source . Chicagoan .
