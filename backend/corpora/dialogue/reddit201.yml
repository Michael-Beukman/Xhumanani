- - So what happened ... did you end up finding a pair of coke bottle glasses 
  - I managed to convince a girl in an opticians to give me some sample contacts without my prescription

- - Ive seen this video many times  I dont understand why the dog has a reason to be afraid .
  - Because they do nt want to get slapped in the butt with claws .

  - hello  i m his right and left hand .
- - Let s be honest ... you can change the config all you want ... you ll never get the FPS that is truly needed until the game is properly optimized .
  - Right  but after that Steam guide that was linked here in the comments  I can play it with ease .
- - This is the kind of chick that would grab your ass and wrap her legs around you when you go to pull out . Stay away OP .

  - Ooh  btw  did you need a nickname 
- - I always wondered what happened to him . Always heard about him in the beginning and then nothing  like he got summoned to the shadow realm or something .

- - i actually do like Doritos and MTN Dew personally
  - I do nt mind MTN dew  but i really do nt like Doritos  i do nt know why
