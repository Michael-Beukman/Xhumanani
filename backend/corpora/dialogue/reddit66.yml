  - He is saying that they got in on name alone .
- - I d like to add that it would also provide an opportunity for the spectators that are nt in the expensive seats to receive an unexpected gift .

- - love the idea but you should remove the ears since the original owl does nt have his ears visible at all .
  - Maybe he photoshopped them in to enhance his appearance .

- - The OJ is from the guy who knows where Nate s vodka is hidden .
  - You re figuring it out all too easily
- - Nice reviews  now you have to get your hands on a GlenDronach CS and one of the single casks

- - They got rid of the wrong one 
  - No they did not . They got rid of the DEAD one .
- - Yea  if people did something decent . But they do nt  and they never will .

  - Did any of you have a Pomson  Those wreck giant medics .
  - We all used Widowmaker except for the one guy we picked up who used the Frontier Justice . Someone really should have run with the pomson .
- - I do nt think Raps have another run in them

- - the fish market and coffee palace are stunning .
  - The Fish Market would have been such an amazing asset to this city .

  - I think this is when all the mods are asleep  so these threads stay up for about four hours .
- - This sub just got tens times more depressing than usual .
  - It s a writers hang out . If everyone is nt pissy  moaning  or trying to tear other people down then they re not writers .
- - Yeah i agree we need more discussions on the sub
  - I tried to encourage this once here . It did nt turn out well .
- - no that s fucked up  I guess I have a impeded tongue
  - Yeah you ca nt do a loud whistle if you ca nt roll your tongue . You have to be able to kind of fold your tongue back on itself .

  - How did he know about Nazis all those years before they existed 
- - The amount new talent has to improve is even higher now  I really hope it breeds a stronger scene as a whole .

  - internet dude vs mick foley it s only embarrassing for mick really
- - Uggh wtf . Nothing on forums about this .

- - the bdubs exploded when this happened  so fun .
  - Oh man . It s good to hear that there are places with people that do nt only care about the Blackhawks .

  - Depends on if you are a Duck Dynasty fan or not .
- - Maybe they do nt wash and stuff every shower  maybe they just get wet
  - That can mitigate damage  and is a good option for if you go to the gym and such . However  water still strips away skin oils . Lotion helps .

  - That s not single payer . Single payer is just that . It s not single price .
- - Tighter underwear is really more comfortable with genital piercings in general imo  especially during healing . edit . corrected spelling
  - yeah the more it does nt move in snug underwear  the less annoying it is
- - Because it s not just football  a club represents the community too  and the people
  - Which is why I think they should be the ones who decide  not random people online signing a petition
  - The club is nt just the guy running it  it s the people who live in the area  have gone to the matches for decades .
  - And you think its just people from the area and fans of the club signing the petition 
- - Haha  How did you even fucking do that

  - Your hair just does nt look good enough
- - At first read it comes off as very sarcastic  seeming as if he s mocking the people who despite never meeting him were so affected by his death
  - Seems to me like they just speak english as their second language . It s easy to misinterpret what they said though .
- - Making me think that PowerofEvil s game against TSM was no fluke . That dude is good .
  - Then he got beat by Hai . I m pretty sure he was just having a bad day .

  - For sure  Thanks for watching and hopefully I can get a video up for every attack
- - Exactly  Harry has displayed the ability and would definitely use it in a life or death situation .
  - The question is nt would or would nt he . The question is could or could nt he while being force choked .
- - do nt remember the first time  do nt remember the last time
  - because they were the same time ... poor poor man

  - For how many offensive rebounds you re getting  an outside shot just might be your best entry pass .
- - Well he did nt want a Pc  so he bought a console . I bet you could play good games and play with friends if you bought a console .
  - I m sure this would nt be happening if you bought a PC instead of a console .

  - Whenever I watch Nagata vs Shibata  I kayfabe it in my head that it s just Nagata disciplining his moody teenage son .
- - Okay  so how does that make people who boycotted them wrong 
  - Well  their boycott was successful  so there is no reason to keep doing it .

- - Dortmund relegated and win the Champions League in the same season .
  - Not sure whether to laugh or cry at that .
- - I know it s off topic  but I do nt like the floating icons . I wish they just left the flags alone .

- - You could always just dremel the hole wide enough to work
  - Thanks I may try that if I have to
- - They have a right to be offended . They do nt have a right not to be offended . Exactly what he said .
  - Ah I missed the not . My bad
- - I do nt think it s for trends . I think he changed after high school when he realized there s nothing special and attention-grabbing about being a republican .
  - It could be a case of over sheltering  or Preacher s Kid .
- - Someone s got to make up their mind about the Finnish stereotype
  - I think the first query represents people who want to visit and the second one represents newcomers .

  - Just the ups guy so I get money .
- - What is a good comic with Vision as one of the prominent roles  I am looking for a more modern feel as opposed to the older stuff .
  - Vision is about to join the Uncanny Avengers cast with the next volume .
- - Forget religion and the right to bear arms . I think they d be more appalled at the devolution of the English language . Nobody speaks like that anymore .
  - Well no one has every bothered to create a federal language to be used across the nation . The United States of America has no official language .
- - Deliverance taught me to fear the rednecks in the woods .
  - Deliverance taught me to hunt humans because how many psychos can their be operating at one time 
- - You are the sucker in a poker game . No one ever liked you they put up with you because they liked your ex

- - Hey  he was from my neck of the woods 
  - Mine too . I saw something about him on Prairie Public  which is how I became aware of him .
- - ok  so taking any risk on betting on csgl is useless good to know ...
  - That s kind of the dangerous precedent being laid here .
- - The law requires doctors who perform operations to have hospital admitting privileges . It baffles me this was nt required in the first place .
  - Becuase it accomplishes nothing and is a useless requirement
- - A great collection of photo s . Thanks for sharing . I m in the north eastern suburbs myself

- - So  you want America to be MORE like Saudi Arabia then . Because that s a good thing . Gotcha .
  - No they migrate to other places and then get angry when those countries do nt change to their values .
- - Not relevant . Terrible comparison . That is NOT how the Nazi s came to power and making the comparison is irresponsible and inaccurate .
  - That is absolutely how Nazis came to power .
- - Your friend is an idiot and should know it s antics like this that get teachers fired and blacklisted
  - That s exactly what I was thinking I am hoping to talk to her about it .
- - How much good stuff can they have left   
  - The funny thing will be when this all turns out to be the bad stuff  and everything else is just amazing .
- - Right before the two of you break up  I guess .
  - Well ... there will be some crying  yelling ans name calling before the actual breakup ... but this varies
- - Finn ... is so tall ... I have nt noticed  but he s definitely growing up ...
  - Indeed  it s interesting to see shows that actually have their characters age over time .
- - I would think twice before letting her darn any of your socks .
  - I agree  then she ll be sewing the piss hole of his underwear
- - What would you say to someone who is neutral  on the KKK

  - Alright  I ll add you and grab the eggs .
- - Lions . I ve always liked them  for some reason .
  - I like them because I ve never had a reason to dislike them  unlike most teams in the league .
  - Really  I do nt get you guys . Dirtiest team in the league for a few years now .
  - Yeah but we hardly ever play them so a lot of casual fans are nt exposed to that .
