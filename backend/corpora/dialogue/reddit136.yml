- - I m saying they re the same show ... But no  TBBT is from Penny s perspective .
  - I guess it does nt matter . The important thing is IT crowd was funny  BBT is not .
  - The IT crowd has never been funny .
  - Obviously not . That s why it got four seasons and a special .
  - And TBBT has been on for like eight seasons now

  - It s mostly a symbolic attempt  but a broken collarbone is considered good luck for the union .
- - Was nt that the year of the writer strike 
  - It was  but WWE was unaffected as their writers are not part of the WGA  nor any other union  because yknow  they work for Vince .
- - This is completely unrelated to women s rights

- - i came here to post this  but in truth  i loved the fingerpoke of doom . so may ways to talk about it

- - Not quite history  but the Greeks and their gods were fucked up .
  - Greeks in general were pretty fucked up . From all the sex they had .
- - Nowadays  yes . Not so much in the middle ages  Back then the pope of course directly approved some crazy and violent stuff .
  - Considering that the Middle Ages were a crazy and violent time why would you expect anything else 
  - i do nt . and if you want to see some REAL insane stuff  look at protestants shortly after the reformation . John Calvin was downright BRUTAL .
  - Of course . You do nt think they were going to let Catholics have all the fun of burning heretics and witches 
- - Its sad when quoting wiki is considered insensitive
  - Wiki is now better . But it is a poor source of spider info .
- - by god ... do not eat these . they look SLIMY  which is probably a good clue as to what they are . they have a THICK mucous membrane .

- - They look like they are from the future .
  - That s one horrible future I do not want to be a part of
- - The reason they were close with the Nazis was because they hopped that Hitler can help them in achieving independence from the Brits  Ottomans and Kingdom of Yugoslavia in Bosnia .
  - it s interesting that philo of the house so closely resembles nazi ideology  i guess they have to be hatemongers to be free of Brits 
- - is the top very loose  so i can still let the rest of my herbs in it when i have enough after a few hits 
  - I just keep a rubber band around it . Not a big deal .
- - Nice shoes . Even if I personally do nt like that style on myself they re dope as fuck dude .
  - Thanks man  I m slowly working my way in to this style and I m happy it s working out pretty well so far .

  - As far as I can tell  it does nt matter . Either works fine
- - Sweet thanks for letting me know . Are you going to mainly be watching the Halo or COD 
  - I slightly favour CoD but I ll have both streams open flicking between them .

  - Thanks  Was really relaxing to watch it back after I d done it .
- - Oviedo opened up the game today when he got forward putting in some really fast and accurate crosses instead of just trying to walk it in to the box .
  - Really encouraging stuff from him . That hopefully triggers that trust Martinez needs so he can validate Oviedo .
- - Might have skimmed that post and missed it
  - It was mentioned in the initial KTK reveal  multiple Articles since  as well as major Articles concerning the future of Block structure .

- - she made none of the comments he is claiming  I did . she didnt say anything about there company i did . but thanks for the answers
  - Did you do it on her account  You do nt dispute that it s a true account other than that it was you  That s not a false statement .
- - I have one if you re still looking . Put something on the GTS . Do you want male or female 
  - I got one meanwhile but thank you very much regardless 
- - It would be impossible to film all this in one shot  let alone get it to be interesting  and the guy to have stamina .
  - who said anything about one shot . if shot correctly you can insert edits between different takes without the casual observer noticing it .
- - Marriage is one of the issues traditionally left up to the states .
  - But traditionally  a lot of states suck . I think the nation has a responsibility to protect all of its citizens from discrimination and dehumanization .
- - Weed is not a drug . It should nt stop people from being able to work ever .
  - No  but when could have an easy job  almost guaranteed to be hired with a clean drug screen ...

  - Tbh before this season everyone cowboy fan and player wanted to take a machine gun to his dick at least a little .
- - That first Russian goal where the guy that scored taunted the Canadian bench and one of them took a roughing penalty ... That s Russian hockey right there .
  - Russians are always tough when they know there is no possibility of a real fight breaking out . Aside from Ovechkin ... he is legit .
- - It s almost like you re talking to yourself  as you ve never posted a single shred of proof of your wild ideas about the Holocaust .
  - Let me know if you ever find any evidence .
- - I m generally a hug slut but I do nt like hugs from people I just met .
  - I ve hugged people I have nt even met yet .
- - The font in the self posts or the font of the titles 
  - The font of the self posts is serif  while almost all sneaker brands use sans serif . Does nt fit thematically imo
- - Two generations younger  and still partake in this ritual . Hate the after dribble into my pants .
  - Several generations younger  who cares how I pee

  - I guess they thought they were being funny and belittling me or something . I doubt they realized the storm that was coming haha .
- - If no memes is already a rule why are nt you enforcing it  Should nt matter where the rule is listed .
  - Ya  that is an inane solution to a very  very simple problem .
- - I m game  how much stuff are we supposed to send  Two different half pounds cool  Or should I be buying gear to send too 
  - Its up to you and your partner how much you trade . If you want to send gear  go for it . You will probably get more in return .
- - Just out of curiosity  have you seen Soul Eater  Because those earbuds remind me a lot of Justin s in that anime
  - I have seen Soul Eater but I m not familiar with the characters . Is that the neurotic well dressed boy 
- - Revisit Ize and On the Other Side . Then  give Julian s solo work a listen 
  - Several people have mentioned Ize to me  it s one of my favourites from the album  for sure .
- - That s a nice edit . I am happily married but thank you for the compliment .
  - Dang  Ok  find any cool secret passages in the multi-million dollar houses 
- - How come you have never once denounced the Westboro Baptist Church  Why do you hate the troops 
  - Guess you missed my points  try reading what I posted .

- - Cause Jesus he knows me  and he knows I m right .
  - The novelty has worn off and Peter Gabriel is better than Phil Collins .
- - I m going to go with Tyreke Evans as well . If the pelicans can get a PG like dragic or even darren collison that would be perfect
  - Tyreke has won us a couple of games this year . It s more of coach fault he gives him the ball and green light at the end of games .
- - Holy shit  He was totally using the jumbotron to see where the guys behind him were  Brilliant 
  - That happens literally all the time . At least in the NFL it does .
- - Are you logged in  The problem only showed up when I was logged out .

  - I ve been so sore since I started this . Worth it .
- - Well is there even any point to cutting with test then  Will you look any different than cutting natty 
  - Well  cutting on test will help you maintain a lot more mass  especially if you are over your natural limit which we all should be right 
  - Well if you re over the natty limit I doubt the individual will cut on just test alone .
  - Either way . You will hold mass on a higher deficit with test than natty as well .
- - I need to learn how to do this
  - acting classes should do you alright . Some people just have natural talent though .
- - With low supply I know demand wo nt increase it will remain the same  but the price should increase because there is less in the market . Right 
  - Theoretically yes . You should look at the chart for natural gas . Oil could just do that
- - Or  you know  some spare gasoline and a cigarette .
  - Yeah  because only straw buildings are vulnerable to arson .
- - Then why is Israel allowing Al Qaeda to share a border with it 
  - I would imagine  based on how AQ blends in with civies  that they do nt do so willingly .
- - Great color on these . Good luck with the surgery 
  - Thanks  The color in person is actually a little bit greener and lighter as these have some water staining which drastically improved the shade of the boot .
- - any idea why im getting an error message in the player 
  - No clue  buddy I ve used this site for years now . Google Chrome with Adblock and no problems ...
- - I enjoy ICP for a laugh  it s good smoking music . But holy fuck Juggalos take it way too goddamned far  look at them comments .
  - yeah  looked like yahoo comments up in there .
- - See  she sold the picture by using vertical video . No one expects someone to actually be filming vertically .
  - Or rather because nobody in history has ever taken a selfie in landscape .
- - It s on a game by game basis . Not exactly in Valve s control .
  - Could nt Valve force standards on Devs  I find it weird that you have to enter a key and create an account with the developer .
- - Better to report it anyways so they can test too
  - No mod developer will accept an issue without replication proof .
- - I would hand wash it if i were you
  - For sure  she said the paint is dishwasher safe but I m not taking any chances
- - Do nt bring a gun to a drone fight .
  - Why fight the drone when you can fight the operator  Or better yet  get him on your side .
- - Editors do nt watch down finals . Assistant Editors  Online Editors  and Producers do . Someone s getting fired for sure .
  - Good editors do . Good camera people in too Especially in commercials
- - I do nt think so . Very few people predicted that Lampard would fit in to City s team this well .
  - Yeah but  we did nt have to . Just Pellegrini
- - You know  I m so glad we can bond over this . We should start a Nightmare Boob Club .
  - Can we  The sisterhood of the boob nightmares .
- - Be kind . This is my first attempt .
  - Great job man  I did nt notice anything wrong  I definitely would nt have noticed that it s your first try .
- - I do nt think you should compare them  swanny is a slayer and boze an obj .
  - Boze was practically the slayer on SyN . He did well too .
  - BoZe only shows up on teams that he feels comfortable with . For instance he felt comfortable with the old ON line up .
  - IMO him and Ricky are so much better when they are teaming together .
- - I should start brushing my teeth as routinely as I run ...
  - Meh  it s not going to help your times much .
- - I had just closed the bathroom door to pee when I heard the Hawks scored . What a play by Toews 
  - Drink more so you have to go again .

  - I m telling you it does nt work haha . That s the point actually
  - oh o.O It used to work for me ... thanks for pointing out
  - It never worked actually  for anyone .

- - It s surprisingly less funny when it s spelled out .
  - He asked me to explain it  my hands were tied
- - i know hence i said it was a military target ... there was no sarcasm there ...
  - I was just expanding on what you said with some detail as to why it was a military target .
- - I ll be the third person . I m not really working  I pretended I had to take a dump but in all reality I m just masturbating in here .
  - Essentially getting paid to masturbate  I like your style .
- - Everyone on this sub should read Bill James  book Popular Crime .
  - How so  Curious as to why 
  - Everyone in this sub should read my niece s Twilight fan fiction .
  - I would be up for that if I could get a hold of some of Jay s weed .
- - Last year I took myself to Chez Max s . I think I want to do that again this year . Guess it s about time I make a reservation ...
  - You should organize a valentine s day meet up for those that do nt have SO s .

  - More Islands  larger bay  granted it does look similar  but I am allowing people to edit it as they wish and then decide on the best one .
- - Except for that time when it was Omnigul with Arc Burn . That could have been a hard mode raid .
  - That weekend I was heroic  but not legend .
- - I have a bunch of lotr if your interested
  - I am . but what are you interested in  and what do you have 
- - Careful around that puppy  mine literally killed more than a dozen courtiers and injured many more .
  - Same ... Should nt have named it Lucifer .
  - Wait what  The names affect its behavior 
  - I do nt think so ... Seems like something Paradox would do though .
- - SEC or not  we can all agree that this new ESPN score display is the biggest travesty of the bowl season .
  - Why does everyone hate it so much .
- - By your username  you may want to see a doctor ... . p

- - You re clearly a shitty person . Nobody will care when you die .
  - You as well . But then again  that s my point  is nt it 
- - No . Maybe reduce frequency of squatting but focusing on ISO is retarded .
  - Thanks for the short  but sweet answer 
- - No ao kuang fix to his ult doing no dmg when not used as the execute 
  - Or you know the whole his ult has no cooldown when canceled part but still executes . They did nt fix that either .
- - I know that some people with black hair use straws to do a set to loosen out their natural texture . It might just give you a more defined curl .
  - I m going to try it this weekend . I ll post results
