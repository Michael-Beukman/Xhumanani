- - You understand there s a world of difference between central and commercial banks  right 
  - Instead of being pedantic  what do yo actually think of the article and it s proposals 
- - I was actually standing on a platform while putting up some curtains . Went down using a chair and lost my balance .
  - Ouch . I imagine it would feel like riding a bike for the first time in a while  but worse .
- - That last picture gave a good ole darn chuckle 
  - I was really high with the TV on and his face made me laugh uncontrollably so I had to rewind and pause it to get that picture hahaha
- - Never underestimate the power of spin and misdirection ...
  - I wish you were wrong . Add to that the power of blind faith religious zealotry ...
- - Impressive to say the least . Not impressed by the dog pics though but that s just me .
  - Heh  thanks . Aw  my baby ... maybe its the eye boogers . She shows better than she photographs just like her dad .
- - Does the game really need AP Trist to exist  I find her to be on the same page as AP Master Yi was .
  - At least she s not invincible the whole time .
- - Fuck it . Yoahtl appears to be in dire straits and ... idk  I really have more free time than I was anticipating .
  - If you return maybe I ll actually meet you for once .

  - The last episode of the BW saga I think .
- - They have a similar element  but no  not the exact same scenario .
  - You do realize that the tree you re complaining about is nt actually blocking your view of the forest  right 
- - Their logic is that their counties should have equal representation with Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties . They re weak politically because no one lives there .

- - I think you ve done a good job so far . Flat colors will keep it simple and you picked a good resolution . Nice start for sure .
  - Thanks for encouragement  ill keep working to make it better .
- - Never actually overclocked an android device . I assume heat becomes more of an issue 
  - Crashing and resetting usually starts happening before heat becomes the big issue .
  - from my experience the cpu is rarely if ever the bottleneck . usually it s a single component or design choice like slow nand or a ram with not enough bandwidth .
  - Overclocking can help with video playback and games  mostly .
  - That s overly simple is nt it 
  - Yes it is simple it s extremely basic that s why it s simple .
  - Something so basic should nt be capable of bricking phones  then  no 
  - I think the bricking comes from putting it in there . Not the actual overclocking .
- - My link is in agreement with your point .
  - Then You should stick around  sorry . I ve had a real bad month working a shitty shift designing machines for the coal industry ...
- - Uh  I m a little confused though now that I think about it . Is Jaune going to be evil  Or is he going to be good 
  - Jaune is going to be Jaune  but he s going to be partially controlled by something very evil .
- - Im into the second season now . I wasnt expecting so much backstory which is why I decided to not watch the series before .
  - As in you do nt like it or

  - I would give my anything to win any of these .
- - I saw him on the field  but I wonder if he will stay there or make his way up to a suite .
  - He ll tag in as HC at halftime .
- - I would put mech yeti Purley cause it s a mech
  - But why  His deck contains no mech synergies .
- - Is there a use for these besides Super Smash Bros 
  - Maybe dolphin emulator  You would need an adapter for your PC . That s one of the main reasons I bought it .
- - It s really strange them promoting a RB .
  - Maybe they re finally jumping the TRich boat .
- - My band now vibrates when the charger connects and disconnects . I do nt believe it did this before  Was this in a previous update I might have skipped 
  - You are not alone . It was not like this before .
- - I want to face them in the playoffs
  - If the season were to end today  that would be the case .
- - I am not a woman  but I think they can predict fairly accurately when their next period is going to be .
  - Not to mention you can definitely predict the last time you had sex and go from there .
- - Your wording of the headline ... I ca nt even .
  - Ca nt take OP seriously because of his complete inability to use correct grammar or titles ...
- - bad time to crash  considering they fill the tanks with jet fuel right before takeoff
  - rarely are fuel tanks filled up . there is never a good time to crash .
- - I m just sitting here wishing that was my closet .
  - I know  that s a huge closet 
- - This was probably my least favorite arc in the series so far  but I still enjoyed it nonetheless .
  - It s the build up . The first arc of what is the final season .
- - Not a massive Balotelli fan but fucking hell  give him a go . Lambert looks more league two than AFC Wimbledon do at the moment ...
  - We may as well have bought Akinfenwa as our striker if we were buying Liverpool supporters last summer I know that s unnecessarily harsh on Lambert though  but still ...
- - I have Trajan . Interested in summoner wars .
  - Nice  Where are you shipping from  PM me and we can work something out
- - Want me to go grab one for you 
  - Sure  thank you so much . . D
- - Attackers have No Deploy Zones for this exact reason . Defenders are the only ones that can drop a Sundy wherever .
  - Wait  are nt no deploy zones universal for both sides 
- - I ca nt unlock the return to sender achievement or the local brewery achievement . I should have unlocked these but it just wo nt give me the achievements .
  - For me it s When Pigs Fly  doesnt work
- - I totally get what you are saying but we are nt talking about a rational thinking person . I m not trying to tell anyone to be scared .
  - You re right . OP stated in another comment that she believes he will come for her  and she of course knows him better than we do .
- - Yes I know what the definition is . Explain to me why the use is wrong .
  - Please explain to me why Jurgen would need revenge upon Jozy .
- - I live in the hill country and it s really beautiful .
  - I m stuck in Waco but every time I go to Austin I want to keep driving into the hill country and just stay there . It s magnificent .

- - i read all of the times you use wrestle to reply and before I actually care i must be sure . You are nt pranking me  are you 
  - I have no idea what you are attempting to say .
- - Is it bad that I kinda do nt want the Lions to win tonight  I do nt want their postseason dry spell to end before ours
  - My wife is a Lions fan  I just told her the same thing .
- - I tried to imply that lasers was bad  not that the lyricism on lasers was bad .
  - Go back to the album if yu get a chance
- - How is it done right  Do you continue to eat the same food  just below your TDEE 
  - calories below TDEE but keep the same protein macro as when bulking  to minimize muscle loss .
- - I have Destination America . Still on the fence watching TNA .
  - I do nt understand ... why not 
- - Check their facebook  twitter and know whenever they poop .
  - Indeed  but it works only if you have twitter or facebook .
  - I do nt need to have a facebook account to check on their facebook .
  - Indeed  but if you do not have a facebook account  you usually do not go around and about facebook .
- - I would love to see this replace his Haven ability augment . Reminds me a lot of Banshee s augment Resonance
  - I feel that augments really should nt take precedence over buffing lackluster abilities  especially with a new frame like Limbo .
- - I think I m going to the show in Jersey . They are playing a shitty little bar in Trenton .
  - Shitty little bars are the best show venues 
- - What series is sharing shelf space next to Harry Potter 
  - Redwall  Were my favorite books as a kid
- - Condolences . May you be able to fix yourself and have a smooth sailing life soon 
  - Many thanks man . I know I will .

  - Probably not many settings . However  restarting seems to have solved the problem .
- - Can anyone explain why I see people key binding the same spell to multiple keys 
  - They are all macros I assume . Or he just likes to be able to hit a general region of the keyboard instead of being precise .

- - Force close the app and reopen it . This usually happens upon prestiging .
  - It just randomly fixed itself idk what was up but thanks 
- - We re getting dangerously close to my wife s due date and ca nt commit to anything lately  so I suppose I ll ride the pine for this one .
  - Gon na miss ya bud . But the wifey and new little Patch are far more important . Good luck

- - I said this same thing and got down voted to hell 
  - Yeah  people have been hassling me about this ever since I said it .

  - There are typically pure breeds in shelters . There are also a lot of pit specific rescues if you re in the US .
- - If you want to see it that way  that s fine . While Bourque is nt great  it felt like playing with Allen was playing a man down .
  - Most Habs fans feel the same way about Bork . He was almost a hockey player
  - He s actually not doing half bad here .
  - He s playing better than he was in Montreal  but that s not a terribly high water mark

  - I tried but my paint would nt stick I might need another kind
- - I was nt aware of the consequences of taking both birth control and plan b . Thanks for the reply  this helps
  - Do nt suggest things like this when you have no idea what you re talking about . I do nt blame her for being pissed at you .

  - And to be slightly clearer  both him and Snape knew he was going to die sooner rather than later due to trying to use the cursed ring .
- - Not many authors would take the time to do something like that  particularly while on vacation . Colfer is a classy guy . Awesome 
  - Could nt agree more  He s awesome .
- - Spain . Dirty  uncomfortable for most things  and just ... eh . Dirty .
  - I hated the hotel i stayed at in Spain . Solid concrete floors and no heating .
- - Why would you EVER buy gauntlet engrams  It s straight up just buying Sunbreakers .
  - Titan here  bought two gauntlet engrams earlier today  got both titan gauntlets . GG Cryptarch
- - No  he s definitely right on all counts
  - If you choose to feel that way .
- - Let s not forget that Garret was also believed to be a super fan that would go all the way and win .
  - Garrett was a recruit and we knew that before the season started from interviews .
- - Or he thought if he pretended not to understand it loudly enough he could re-negotiate it ...
  - I m leaning on this . I ve seen it much more often .
- - I seriously doubt that Portland can support a team  not with their proximity to Seattle .
  - or with Seattle s success . They ve had Oregon locked down since before the asterisk Super Bowl the Steelers beat you guys in .
- - You were also a kid playing video games once ...
  - Orly  U a spy or sumthin  How would you even know how old was I when I first played a video game 
- - What time of year  How long have you got  What s your budget  are you camping  hotels or sleeping in your car 
  - I mean this is all hypothetical I just want to get people s opinions on where to go
- - What s the point in reviewing if nobody recovered the ball before the whistle  positioning for the next down 
  - They would get the ball back at that spot so they would lose a bunch of yards
- - The amount of Bullshit in this Thread about the automated system is ridiculous . Can u guys pls inform yourself before talking about it  Thanks .
  - But ... but that would mean taking personal responsibility for my actions and actually learning something from the ... OHHHHHHH I see what you re trying to do here .
- - Shit man  It s much fucking easier to take the fucking cursing lead .
  - I will not sleep until I dethrone the king at least once this season 
- - that s fucked up unless you re one of the two kids in the picture .
  - I m the short fucker in the grey sweater .
- - Proper diet also helps with wrinkles but ok .
  - And professional photographers and Photoshop  but yeah  she still looks pretty good and probably has nt had the invasive procedures he s guessing at .
- - The one where Lori delivers . The one where Carl goes to get a crib . The one where Eugene enjoys what he finds in the Self Help section .
  - He certainly did help himself now did nt he
- - that intro is such a blatant funky town ripoff ...
  - it s not a rip-off  it s a cover version
- - Poor sensitive crybaby  ca nt handle being mocked . So hurt are you .
  - I m not Muslim . I m not a follower of any religion . Not sure why you thought I m Muslim .
- - why there are so many fighters named Gracie  are they brothers 
  - I m not sure if they re all brothers  but yeah  they re related . MMA royalty  said someone .
- - Whats the helmet the center guy is wearing 
  - its a helmet called terminal that I made a while back . not available yet though .
- - Or yknow you could just give us the fucking date .
  - Which was already done in the title . Your point 
- - Peaky Blinders if you re looking for something you probably have nt heard of . It s made by the BBC and it is phenomenal .
  - I did nt think I would like it and ended up binging on the whole season
- - So its not Doug Marrone s fault Kyle Orton sucked but its Rex s fault that he had the least talented secondary in the NFL 
  - Uh  that s exactly what I m saying . Why is one the coaches fault and one the GMs fault  They re both massive personnel issues .
- - What do they call it where you live 
  - I do nt think it s different  just I ve only been to one funeral and have not yet died .
  - You will eventually  but do nt hold your breath .
  - Well if I do  I could die from lack of air .
- - Why could nt he do that against Germany ...
  - I do nt think the defender plays for Germany or Argentina .
- - Ok . I m going on record and saying that I hate stiff arms to the face . It s just as dangerous as a facemask the other way .
  - I concur . That s how Watson broke his finger .
- - And then there s the people that watch football that flip tables when a touchdown is overturned .
  - And then there s the people that throw their controller through a wall when they get outgunned in the Crucible .
  - Then theres tables that throw the crucible when controllers are touchdown
  - I lol d  here have an upmote
- - Put one screen in front of the bezels of the two others  for the love of god .
  - Having one screen closer that the other two is more annoying . Im used to play like this . This is a temporary setup before getting the Rift .
- - Cold and tired . How are you 
  - lonely  old and cold . but not tired  i slept way too long today . lol
- - Should they add a currency to buy cosmetic versions of amour 
  - I do nt think we need any other currencies .
- - I found a few answers that have changed my life  like putting hydrogen peroxide in my ears when I start to feel sick .
  - Well  I can honestly say I ve never heard that one before . Do you have a link to where you learned this  I m interested now 
- - I m a lefty so I have the ball point Lamy . Love the thing . It s the only pen I ve written with for over six months now .
  - I m also lefthanded and have found Lamy makes lefthanded nibs to go with the fountain pen . They work great easy  smooth and enjoyable to write with
- - Seriously  nobody chose Adolf Hitler  Id be happy to wipe him from history  even though no one has that name today .
  - Bad idea man  not trolling  that s a seriously bad idea .
- - Your writing is impenetrable . You re going to have to be clearer if you want good advice .
  - Sorry I m on a phone ATM . Not near my computer . Please excuse this .
- - Holy shit please cancel that Ahri splash . Please just cancel that whole concept and start a new one or leave it how it is .

  - Oh crap ok in that case id be willing to trade jirachi
- - I ve noticed this  What happens when you activate it
  - Nothing  you ca nt actually activate it it just says it
- - I gave him my first name  because immersion is awesome for this game .
  - Ironically  I purposely do nt name MU after me because it constantly breaks my immersion .
- - So tempting . But I feel like I ve already waited this long . I might as well hold out for a GwG .
  - same here  also have too much of an xmas backlog
- - NA now has the same amount of world champions as Korea ...
  - And China has the most of all despite having never won a championship .
- - It probably only takes children away . Though  why d your girl have a cam in the bathroom  Kinky .
  - It said that she set up a cam  so she must have believed her mother .
- - Willing to hang out and can show u around a little bit .
