  - Would you mind me asking how much it costs 
- - The konami code is nt working on my desktop or is it not supposed to do anything 
  - It s not supposed to do anything haha .
- - I think I will wait until this is in the Play Store . Ca nt wait when new applications are simultaneously released in all mobile stores
  - Given how much of a black box the Apple App Store is  I doubt that will ever happen .
- - Looking forward to watching the future Buckeyes in the Army All American Game
  - I m looking forward to seeing Jerome Baker 
- - Finding out how to get the texture without going through hundreds of them has been quite the revolution  I might give this a try again 
  - Yes  I thought so too . Happy editing 
- - Uhh  those questions are pretty much already asked . No owning a gun if you are a felon and the questionnaire asks if you have been committed .
  - I m very much in favor of those things .
- - I d love to know what ship that is in the foreground with the White Ensign  beautiful ship except for that funnel .
  - It would be interesting to find out  but I have nt been able to . It may have been a tender for the school .
- - I was nt a member of the pool  but the bar had some of the best views in the city  along with great drinks

  - No  they were owned by some very rich folks at the local fox hunting club . They were gorgeous though and seeing them run  it was just ... wow .
- - Yeah  I was nt sure whether or not to include that because the type of ant is nt specified .
  - For example  its would only take one or two bullet ant bites to take down any man
- - You should get This War of Mine . It really makes you rethink games about war .
  - Yeh  been thinking about that . Spec ops . The Line is another game that does that very well .
- - Nope forming Prussia will always give Prussian ideas .
  - Well I still wo nt be able to form Prussia because Poland is allied to Austria .
- - Almost every fight in the game restricts the monsters to a specific zone . Many fights can be won by standing just outside the aggro range and firing in .
  - Yeah . That s what I do . Works well with hunters
- - Woah that big purple one looks like Eve from Kerbal Space Program . Its even got the same little asteroid moon .
  - Hahaha it does  If only it was nt an oceania . Still a beautiful sight though
- - So happy that I voted for him . Sadly he was the only politician I voted for that got elected . Thank goodness for for him and legal marijuana .
  - Ditto  I think Alaskans made a good choice with him . Sullivan bums me out though . Even Lisa seems to be headed backwards .
- - can i hear an explanation on this 
  - His butt hurts . Is that your fault 
- - What research shows this  Running long distances are not counterproductive if you want to be a better runner at distances .
  - True  but it s safe to assume that the majority of people here have other goals like . lose weight  be healthy  or gain weight .
- - Anyone got a VOD I could see 
  - I d also like to see a VOD . I was gone during the match duration .
- - Am I really the only one who notices he s just three children in a trenchcoat 
  - We get it . You do nt like him 
- - I guess she s older than Krem  although I would nt use that term ...
  - I think that is the kind of view that a lot of people thought about Krem and Cassandra . Something always a bit off-putting about females acting masculine .
- - I knew you were too good to be true -- just another woman false advertising . Ugh .
  - I always have chocolate at my place though . Right now it s Milano s .
- - Nice catch  but who the heck grabbed it when he got back to the grass 
  - Im going to guess sombody on the grass .
- - Howdy  I believe I m the first response .
  - That you are . I m on vacation at the moment  and will PM you the code once I get home on Friday night Edit Aaaaand there you go
- - I hope it s something like Clannad did . They animated the other endings after finishing the main storyline with the true ending .
  - Or School Days . Hey  your boat . It s -- ah ... It s kinda nice .
- - And games with no lag . That would be amazing
  - lol find me an online game with no lag

  - Second one . Could nt find the youtube link for the former - thought the user included it in his comment  but it was just the trailer .
- - Because they do nt  They re boring and are not entertaining in that way .
  - But I enjoy their more chilled  laid-back attitudes during Steam Train . It s a calm breakup of the usual insanity of Game Grumps .
- - I dunno but when you just label entire government Neo-Nazi just because there were three acting ministers before the elections you kinda sound like one of those raging Putinbots
  - Not all of it . Just one third of them  roughly .
- - Exactly . Reactionary rather than thoughtful . Edit . and petty
  - Well no  neither example was any of those things  but you clearly have more feelings than ideas  so who cares what you think anyway .
- - I m here now if you re back
  - Back now . Sorry for the delay 
- - Pixel buster freya  gb zhong  predator kali
  - Kali  Meh  Thats just a recolor .
  - this is an opinion based thing  I like kali s recolor a lot more than neith s skin  serqet s skin  fenrir s skin etc .
  - Exaclty  and all I did here was state my opinion
- - I knew our D was mediocre but they ve hung around with good teams . This does nt make any sense . What s the fucking deal 
  - The offense hasnt done its part and the defense fucked itself with that penalty .
- - I really like these three and I m really excited to see them develop their game
  - I know we re in full tank mode  but I like watching this young team much more than last year s team .
- - Also  women do nt actually like sex  they just exchange it like currency for security . Also  women ca nt get enough of the cock .
  - I honestly wonder what the official  line of TRP ideology is regarding free will ; do they believe people actually have free will

  - . DD im a soft trap  i dont harm my victims
- - Take a shower  hippie . And get a haircut while you re at it  . D
  - Wow  first communist  now hippie . Did you get a label maker for Christmas 
- - Sorry  only women allowed ... Sorry  personal peeve of mine . Gender does not mean anything .
  - My bad . I am new to this and saw a ton of people doing it . Thought it was required
- - I was at the Louisville show . It was amazing .
  - I as well . Best show I ve seen in years  if not ever .
- - The fact that you can even get a white headshot hitmarker  it should always be red and the recipient dead .
  - I agree with this wholeheartedly  the amount of times you get a headshot hitmarker is ridiculous .
- - why not just have a caller ID toggle  or is australia different from other countries in that we can just switch on and off caller id 
  - Inside the settings app  Ai nt nobody got time for that .
- - Why do you say that women do the work better 
  - They seem to be more attentive to detail  stay on task  are diligent  and more serious . My opinion  guys goof off more  just sayin ...
- - She is a beautiful Boston terrier mix I think  Maybe with beagle 
  - The ears and size make me think beagle too . Does she like to howl  She is a cute dog 
- - An unfounded speculation designed to drum up funding . Sometimes you have to compromise your integrity to pursue your passion .
  - It will likely be revealed to be a hoax like the shroud of Turin . It s just a matter of when .
- - wow  flashback to my old posts ... I was nt talking about Sirius  I was talking about Domino .
  - Domino being alive would be even FURTHER in the past since domino is an entity in heavens fence during Sirius s time .
- - How would you build the deck differently for Daretti than say Slobad 
  - With Daretti you focus on recursion and graveyard fun . You also get to work with extra draw .

  - I ll look into this also - cheers
- - I always assumed it was the bartender ...
  - He was nt there when it happened  it was after closing .

- - Sure  I m online now  or we can arrange a different time if you want .
  - Thanks for the reply and sorry I left for a little bit . Are you still available 
- - Well  I m not saying the Cardinals have been playing well  but these refs are not helping at all .
  - Also the Panthers are lucky they even made the playoffs with how poorly they performed this season .
- - The Doctor lied to Clara about Gallifrey just as she lied to him about Danny . Gallifrey was not at the coordinates stated by the Master .
  - Oh of course  that s so obvious I ca nt believe that went over my head .

  - Well  at least he did nt go to UK ...

- - So  perhaps this shrinkage is a good thing  until they stabilize to a sustainable size .
  - If it were gradual  it would nt be too bad . Radical cultural shifts are going to make it difficult to stabilize instead of collapse  though .
- - It actually should become possible to detect what people literally think in the near future . As for criminalizing thoughts  that s part of some dystopian scifi .

  - nope - they re still wicked effective at hurling you up to max speed in moments .
- - Freakin Forbes has a video game columnist . I think that time is here .

  - well my channel is going to be gameplay and fan-made trailers of various games . Think about a movie trailer . It only gives you the very basic plot of the movie
- - The thing is I do nt think you can compare the two since they play two very different versions of Dr. Lector .
  - Hopkins felt like a snake  Mads feels like a spider . Two very different versions of the same character .

  - I know  but if you ca nt do it for yourself  do it for your other little brother . You re lucky to be alive and not severely disabled .
- - Evidence is always mired in perspective . Perspective is invariably subjective .
  - Gathering evidence to support your preferred conclusion is mired in perspective . Evidence has routinely shown to be biased towards the truth on it s own .

  - Yeah I d hate to be British  though they re terrible neighbours .

- - I just got it . Salty Sweet . I m a fucking moron .
  - That is nt it . But well spotted 
- - This is like a reality show now .
  - I do nt watch any of them so you ll have to explain . But if that s your thing then  not judging you .

  - Do nt be hating on the mark of business trust
- - Bullies gon na bully . Right to the very end .
  - Ya  sorry for not giving free stuff to someone who sues them and breaking agreements
- - I did nt know Meg was so short .
  - I wonder how tall Geoff and Gavin are . Because they seem like the same height .

- - I d hang out with you and lick your face to make you feel less socially awkward .
  - Ehhh . I think I ll pass . I always have my SO for that .
- - Fair enough . Still wish they d done better than Gustavo if they really feel Redding is not ready .

  - I could have worded that better . York had to choose between Baalke and Harbaugh  and clearly Baalke won .
- - I got in in my Helios and it almost took it out . I will have to find a tankier fit for it .
  - Just do nt go in the clouds . It s possible to do the site with out taking any damage .
- - Correct me if I m wrong but are nt there attacks that have quicker auto cancels then l cancels 
  - I believe there are  but there are many many more that it s better to l cancel than to autocancel
- - I dare you to drink out of it .
  - That s like daring him to drink out of his hand  it is nt dangerous .
- - Was he threatening to shave your pubes 
  - Hahah I assumed he was attacking my Bullet Club shirt
- - I keep getting notifications on my phone and I m replying . If you d like the last word let me know
