- - thats the best metaphor for transitioning i ve ever heard .
  - I used Pokemon evolution in my coming out post on Facebook .

  - You re correct . What he is describing is how you get the Noble Sword . Really just a small mistake though .
- - They say on cold nights like this  you can still hear him running blood knight for some reason .
  - To be fair  the amount of divine shields Paladin is running these days it may sometimes get a fair bit of value .

  - That s my suggestion unless you are dying for a suburban feel .
- - thats what im asking too or even migi he should notice that someone is following the whole time
  - I actually wonder how Migi s sense of hearing works  through Shinichi 
- - I think of it as natural selection ... People repetitively post satirical news posts then I delete them  or unfollow them at the very least
  - It depends on whether they know it is satire or not . The ones that take it as fact  I do consider deleting them .
- - Before starting a new thread does anyone have what we believe to be the basic rules of True American  Or a thread about them

- - The oligarchy is behind it  Wow  that really is a stupid opinion .
  - I never thought it was stupid  but as you just proved it is relatively unpopular

  - Not you alone . Many people . More than half at least .
- - Cause it the server they got the least ping 
  - Ok thank you i did not actually know that .
- - So ... is this combo actually good  Edit  oh I see . It s a class specific legendary that you need to recombobulate .

- - Nah  it is only the booze ... might wan na find a meeting about those habits .
  - or maybe he s clearing his left nostril
- - Wow  I would be super pissed if I was a Lions fan  that was a bullshit flag pick up .
  - everyone should be super pissed regardless  it was complete bullshit
- - Holy shit . Not sure who this guy is - I m I the UK - but that was lovely .
  - Yeah  you missed out as a kid . I assume you ve read the replies below - did you have anyone similar in the UK 
- - Ah  so no Muramasa because their doing other legendary swords from other countries ... Kinda silly that they did nt go for the obvious Excalibur  but okay 
  - They did nt go with excalibur  because they decided to go with swords that actually existed . p
- - People also encourage heroin regularly too  not on this sub though . Besides  if someone already smokes then they might try it out .
  - Where are you seeing these encouragement to try heroin regularly 
- - I ve read that about full fat dairy too . I will give that a try . Sounds like a good plan for exercise too  Good luck 
  - Thanks  Good luck to you as well 
- - What does it say  do you know offhand 
  - I do nt remember . Just go on Bioshock wiki and I m sure you ll find it .
- - Not anime  animation style similar to the last airbender though  that would work .
  - Still looks childish to me  no matter how good it is suppose to be .

  - I do nt know what quantities are being considered but I do know that things have a tendency to not work out the way they are planned .
- - New Orleans makes Key West look like an AA meeting .
  - An AA meeting with an open bar .
- - Yeah ... that was also me trolling Joseph .
  - Poor guy . The stuff you said was crazy and funny but completely authentic TBM reasoning .
- - Di Maria will get points but I d wait till he is starting regularly again and can prove to stay fit . Pass on Falcao .
  - Wo nt Di Maria  the most expensive player in the league  play regularly immediately as his team kinda need him 
- - Time to hit some local places and see if I can find it . Thanks 
  - Sure thing  Good luck on finding it  it s a treat to be sure .

  - Bike is a Suzuki GSR  exhaust is an aftermarket Scorpion .
- - They re just opening the cut-off on a low pass filter . It s not an effect  really  it s part of the synth sound .
  - how do they make the sound only appear at that particular moment  Edit . or is it like a sustain 
- - Your link just points to the front page .
  - They had a flyer on the front page  the sale was nt active on the site .
- - We did nt cut him . Practice Squad players are eligible to be signed to any other team s active roster .
  - Oh my bad  I did nt know that .
- - Still getting attacked by system authority vessels for attacking bounties in RES .

  - It s a sled deck made by Mission
- - But your off topic . I asked a question  your supposed to answer it rather than insult the question .
  - He has every right to disagree with the premise of your question . That s hardly insulting it  nor is it off topic .
- - why did you and your gf get in the car of a person that was driving drunk 
  - We had also been drinking and did nt think it through properly . Obviously that was the initial mistake which lead to this .
- - Make the world end . It s the only thing everyone is looking forward to .
  - i m not you can go if you want but i do nt mind living .
- - The irony of Steve Downie playing peacekeeper after two teammates brawl
  - With Downie between them  I m sure they ll Bounce back .
  - I do nt know . Downie is a bit of a thug  I m sure nobody wants to Snuggle with him .
  - I think the Tide has turned though . Maybe this is the beginning of a different role for him .
  - What can you Gain from things like this though 
  - I see Sunlight at the end of this tunnel
- - fuck yeah were not CLEVELAND WERE NOT BLOWING NO LEAD
  - Thats because our coach will actually get mad and try to do something about it
- - I feel like you pretty much blew your credibility with this post .
  - What credibility  I m just a random internet guy .
- - How do the parrots react  I imagine they quite like being cozy 
  - Not really . Unless you remove it in the cold  they do nt understand the purpose of it
- - The fact of the matter is that there just are nt enough new exotics to replace the old ones .
  - This is something I can also agree with . More gear should be introduced in future expansions .

  - Today s server save  technically tomorrow .
- - Hi and happy new year if you can please add me I can help you now if you like
  - that would be great  adding you now
- - All it takes is one bladedancer or voidwalker or striker to ruin your day
  - Agreed . As a Striker Titan in PvP nothing puts a smile on my face like seeing a bunch of people hanging out in a bubble  thinking they re safe .
- - There was also no need to post the stream profile of that person  but here we are .
  - You would nt know who he is if I did nt . Fetch le stick .

  - Could you share the link for the video  Getting interested since I ve never heard of this guy before .
- - So how do they avoid seeing this from happening in movies with screens on-camera 
  - A lot of the time  they edit the screens in .
- - Wiki already updated to say he plays for SKC . Is wiki dropping hints now too 
  - It s a good thing not just anyone can edit any old garbage into Wikipedia .
- - Thanks OP . I m not supposed to like you  but I ll make an exception . Cheers for the new year 
  - Aww thanks . I ll remember our time together fondly .
- - If it does nt have any articulation  whats the point 
  - To put it on a shelf like the rest of us who have wrestling figures . It s already in a sweet pose anyway .
- - Dashdance camping . It will make Sheik and Peach mains really  really butthurt though .
  - What makes it specifically camping  I dash dance a lot and use it to get grabs and juke and stuff  is there more I should be doing 
- - Anyone else think this lego thing has gotten completely out of hand 
  - No  why do you say that 
- - I m aware  but I need to sleep for work . THANKS

  - just do the regular stuff . progressive flirting and dates . Movie nights . Touch her on the boob .
- - A lot of cough syrup tastes pink tho
  - Eeeeh cotton candy and pepto bismol are pink tasting .
- - Would you feel better if I mailed you a check  Google Wallet is fine if you want to eat the fees .

- - Can you guys respond to my ticket or thread please 
  - our ticket guy will get to everything tonight

- - Ah yes  getting back money that already belonged to you .
  - I seriously do nt know why people get excited over it . Edit . Downvoted without any comments haha nice .
- - Even though he gets annoying  Primetime Draven has all the quality of a legendary skin  new look  new spell animations  and new voice lines .
  - This one and Pool Party Graves are the only two skins I ve legitimately hated . Something about the microphone axe indicators just throws me off so hard .
- - I know my comment was made in frustration and not logically  but where did I blame god 
  - No where . But since were not blaming the lions I figured I d blame something else
- - Do you have a Winco nearby  Their prices are the best on a lot of things .
  - Not sure ... have nt heard of one around here . I ll look into it 
- - That s a good idea . I ll have to make a trip to REI or Cabelas sometime soon .
  - Rei actually usually has weighted bean bags which you can stuff into the pack . Not quite like actual gear  but it helps keep their packs in sellable condition .
- - I think nintendo wants to reach the competitive community  but Sakurai does nt .
  - I think it s more so that NoA wants to reach the competitive community  but NoJ does nt .
- - Thank you kindly friend  I will try recording with OBS instead .
  - No problem  Hope it works well for you 
- - He took his helmet off in celebration 
  - It fell off  he put it right back on . Clearly not taking it off .
- - How do I join without sending friend request 
  - Only other way is through a party  which is essentially the same thing  effort wise . Unfortunate constraint of the system .
- - It d be a shame if none of the teams made the super bowl
  - There s a first time for everything .
- - Kinda ridiculous that the guy got pissed when you tried to smother the fire .
  - tell me about it my boss paid me back the expense though and i recently got a better car so its a happy ending i guess
- - I am so amazed by how rapidly this map filled in . It is amazing . Also as a Michigander it makes me feel embarrassed . I blame our brain drain .
  - All your people keep coming to Chicago . I swear I keep seeing a new Michigan bar every week .

- - The one in which he implicates Adnan  I ca nt remember which one it is though .
  - Seemingly neither can he . But there are several to choose from so we can all take our pick .
- - I suggest reviewing my post because I said everything you ve said here .
  - Well I fail to see how I repeated your point when everything I said contradicts what you said ...
- - Frontflip . People are being a little pedantic .
  - No  I m sorry . You got it wrong  he will backflip  we re sure of it .
- - its just another tool people are nt using well  if randoms are shit and gon na rush  they are gon na rush with or without sprint
  - Both you and another poster got it right on the nail .
- - Nice  I had her  but the face looks weird to me so I sold her .
  - She s a pretty cool figure  but her face  IMO  she looks quite different than normal .
- - They barely cooperated in the studio by all accounts
  - LOL bullshit . You re thinking about Let It Be . Go read Anthology sometime .
- - How long should she get then  You must have a number in mind 
  - She should go to jail for the maximum allowable time of the offenses she tried to frame someone for .
- - On a bright note FSU fans  you guys finally have your quality loss all but locked up .
  - Ca nt get trounced in a quality loss .
- - Dodged the point like a true mong .
  - sucked the dick like a true hipster fag
- - So is this like an invisible lock screen 
  - Yes . I use AC display but would like to add a bit more security to it .
- - I see your point . Does that mean Dr. Phil is also here 
  - You re good dude  this sub is mostly reposts .
- - He can not throw for big plays . That is a big problem
  - He also does nt have the time to
- - Running the game in it or the device all the time 
  - Just in-game . For some reason battery saver does nt affect gameplay but it does lag if you re switching between apps .
- - That bitch is spinning clockwise and no other direction . Anyone that thinks she s going counter clockwise needs to get their eyes checked .
  - Look at the append to see how counterclockwise moves  then go back and look at her
- - So when does Jim hand her the team 
  - After he dies and she sues her step mother for ownership rights  just like her daddy did .
- - Well you still both look great . That cat face is ADORABLE 
  - Cats respond better to women than to men  probably due to the fact that women s voices have a higher pitch .
- - i have actually gone back and bought some of the older kits since I really liked their design .
  - ok  that is indeed a valid reason  but I want my favorite kit in the highest quality  so I think I will pass on this one . P
- - Remember the part where they said to stop making things up about things you do nt understand 
  - You have nt refuted my points at all . You ve presented an irrelevant question to make my points seem less valid . Please refute my argument with facts .
- - A few dozen posts with it in the title and it seems like dozens upon dozens more in the comments .
  - Forgive me  but I m skeptical . Unless you mean total  out of the hundreds of thousands of comments  and probably tens of thousands of posts .
- - Banshee by Carmex . Hardcore balm for hardcore shit .
  - GOT AN ACHE  SCREAM AT IT 
- - There is nt much separation between corporations and government  so data they collect will make it back to government spy agencies through hacking  cooperation  or both .
  - Better put on your tin foil hat then .
- - Excellent  but is nt it pique and not peak 
  - First of all  thanks  and second of all  you know better than me I have never really done this before or wrote for fun so thanks . TIL
- - They did that with Breaking Bad . They added the second half of the last season later . We ll see .

  - You guys are doing a good job  Dota scene needs a show like this
- - That s sad to hear about your grandparents . Did they recover 
  - They physically recovered but the event left it s mark on them . They were nt as relaxed and expansive after that . They were damaged psychologically .
- - Then TTK should ve removed them when the map came out a year ago .
  - why remove something if it is nt causing problems 
- - So Kiev is the best tribal province  then 
  - That and Marrakech  but looking at the provinces that surround Kiev  yes  Kiev is the best province and duchy .
- - Kid . There is no way to mitigate a DDOS effectively . You literally have to wait it out .
  - I was just curious on if it was happening to anyone else  sorry ...

  - I agree  They look delicious  Maybe we will see them on dragons den and Jim franchises them  
- - Nobody here is going to touch any website named Silkroad with a ten foot pole . just sayin 
  - You need to start using different language it s becoming obvious you re the same person .
- - Off-topic but should nt you avoid screens when you have a concussion  Do nt get brain damage dude 
  - Yeah  but it s not a super super major concussion . It s been a month or two since I got it  and it s been gradually getting better .
- - I did clamp it extremely tight  Oops . I am starting to think that pins are indeed the better option here . Thanks for your advice 
  - Use pins and epoxy . Peen the pins too . That way you have a chemical and mechanical bond
- - Either provide logs of that with proper report or I have hard time believing you . It is one of the fundamental MM rules that are used in random battles .
  - Got ta love community managers who flat out call customers liars . gg no re
- - Finally footage that somewhat shows Quick s celebration and skate over to the pile  Love it .
  - Right  They only showed it for a second during the actual game and then I had nt seen it again until this .
- - Before it is too late for the remaining Jews to escape .
  - Well  an organized rescue sounds a bit too horrible . The French do nt have a Third Reich type of government or anything .

  - Because it s not a sphere  It s basically a dipole field .

  - I m glad it came out well 
- - So in other words if youre not attracted to someone you should force yourself to be . Isnt that rape of some kind 
  - basically yes  but it s for a good cause so shhhhh
- - Very strange . Does this happen with other games 
  - Nope . I think the people above may have answered it though .
- - The thing is  you ca nt queue actions in Brood War . He manually split those units .
  - You can queue move and attack orders  ca nt you 
- - there s no such thing as a casual  conversation about politics unfortunately . that s my opinion .
  - YOU HAVE TO TYPE IN ALL CAPS TO GET YOUR POINTS ACROSS
- - Nothing about this bike makes sense ... Now I need to know what the rider looks like .
  - Black dude  effeminate  many earrings . Nice guy . Loves cycling . Has some cool vintage bikes too .
- - But the question then is why do they want to kill the survivors 
  - Because they keep getting shot at  so now they re sick and tired of it
