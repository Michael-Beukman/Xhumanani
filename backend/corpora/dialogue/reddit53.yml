  - I m sure that has nothing to do with the fact that you need a wing ...
- - This was a result of the fan vote .
  - Which was put in place by the nhl . Was it really a surprise to the NHL that the hawks would dominate the fan vote 
  - They most likely knew something like this would happen . But they probably think fans enjoy shit like this .
  - Honestly  Chicago just dominates fan votes . We usually take the baseball final votes too .
- - It s a reference to the Insane Clown Posse song Miracles
  - Oh . That explains why I completely missed that .
- - Salt adds exactly zero calories . No matter how much you add .

- - Now I want to play Soul Calibur .
  - A tale of souls and swords  eternally retold  We re practically legally obligated to go back and replay it every so often .
- - Regarding Adnan not calling . Are we only talking about cell records here or landline too 
  - It seems like the only records anyone has are the records from Adnan s cell  if I recall one of the notes Dana included on the Serial website .

  - he was highly underrated right before proleague started and arguably still is underrated .
- - Can you make it so you can see the green battery and make it FLOWING when it is charging  Edit . some words

- - I would nt doubt the billion punches in a second but I do nt think they d bust stars .
  - I mean . They d be going pretty fast .

- - Pizza rolls and porn are a great combo
  - Thanks for the idea I m going to go make some

- - Did you quit cold turkey  or are you using some form of nicotine 
  - I am vaping  not a lot  just when the cravings go into over drive .
- - Eh  not true . Take Razer Comms for example . It caused a bit of buzz when it was released  then died off because Teamspeak does everything better .
  - Razor comms does nt rate to Curse Voice .
- - This actually helps clarify why there are those random contradictions
  - Does it  The contradictions are nt a result of the varied tellings -- they re sort of the point of the poem .
- - I ve always fantasized about being a pin up girl and having all those men adoring you .
  - Oh  so much ... to have men everywhere thinking naughty thoughts about me ...

  - I thought the exact same thing when gamemodes like infinite enchanter and flower power came out .
- - I definitely like the idea of having a level limit much better . Quest requirements are good too .
  - Good thinking  Scrap the gold price idea . Total level and quests done is much much better
- - And the Great Red Spot rotates into view during that transit . I wo nt miss it .

- - you know you can change sentinel weapons right  just making sure
  - Yep  but if I had to keep one companion it would be the Carrier  which comes with the Sweeper by default .
- - Strange feeling about this lineup . Friday is an amazing day for me  while Sunday may be the worst day I ve ever seen .
  - im just about totally the opposite  that s Coachella for ya .
- - Why do you go to your brother s room 
  - I get easily addicted to games . I do nt want that . So I requested him to install those games and let me play in the morning for sometime .

  - But he would nt be able to analyze the aesthetics .
- - So a drink themed on Toys in the Attic   Good luck with that one XD
  - I was thinking an alien brain hemorrhage would have a suitably disgusting texture .

  - For some reason in America  schools have the last say .

  - Ok and why do you think execution is wrong 
- - I think predictions are worthless . Nice pictures though .
  - Me too  but it s nice to speculate about .

  - I see . Makes sense I guess . Thanks 
- - Is this a secret contest and did I win 
  - hmm . perhaps . perhaps not . Outlook unclear .

  - he kicked his legs out after the trip . pretty classic dive i think .
- - I keep a package of these in my desk at work .
  - Can I ask how you get them to the bathroom without carrying them for the world to see 
- - Goat Simulator has prepared me for this one  Just find the nearest gas station and head butt it  with my back turned toward home .
  - Or find the nearest goat fight and get jacked  then go to the Satanist sacrifice place and make the appropriate sacrifices and fly home .
- - Maybe try NYX matte lipstick in Alabama 
  - I just checked that out and it definitely looks really similar  Thank you  . D

  - Yeah I posted this because of the Rosalina post about the Target twitter reply .
- - Even then I really do nt have a hard time remembering how many hours to subtract .
  - Agreed  but you never know what other people struggle with .
- - Maybe it s about what is the truth . Lies and memory  how lies become memory . How we believe our own lies .
  - Well it would still be about lies then
  - But not just lies  about how they interact with other factors .
  - Well yeah obviously . Unless someone was lying into the vacuum of space . Which is probably jays next story  Right guys   zing
