  - The chin is moved forward way too much
- - It was my Spring Break  so I was drinking and mudding with my buddy on his farm .

  - Look out this guys going to MOW down the competition .

  - I wish it did . I play Minecraft through Steam and I like Steam s playtime tracker . It s an interesting little bit of info .
- - Quickcast fix . It s such a fucking gamble trying to use it right now .
  - What do you mean  Can you explain your issues 
- - Can they take a brick to the face 
  - Probably  but it would take extreme focus to lob a brick while you re getting charged down by dobermans .
- - My last girlfriend was really kinky and I think it just came up in conversation pretty naturally . We were always open about that sort of stuff .
  - I sort of expect this to be true with most cases .

- - Thumbnail looks like the Matrix  turned out to be more like MIB
  - Did nt even notice that  but very true .

  - Shump is the main piece  JR is just the offloaded contract .
- - I d say that at most  only about half of people can get pregnant
  - Afterall  the average person has about one boob and one ball .
- - It s an easy mistake to make  no worries . I just wanted to let you know before somebody with a less pleasant disposition inevitably finds this post .
  - Good call haha  thinking it ll go bye bye now . Kinda pointless 
- - Man would Iove to hear the back story on this one . Edit . silly auto correct .

  - Definitely not  its a great mice overall .
- - Some shops literally do not let guys go near the changing rooms even with another girl in hand leading them there
  - Probably because some people have sex in the changing rooms .
- - There was basically a mutiny under Bill Callahan . The players hated him .
  - Not when he was hired to take over for Jon . The players gave Callahan the thumbs up then . Two years later was the mutiny .
  - He also took us to a Super Bowl the year he had the players  support . Bad example .
  - I think the year after that proved it had little to do with him . He was a horrible coach with a stacked team .
- - Who cares what tabloids and unreliable news media says 
  - Dispelling ignorance is a good thing  especially when there are people that would use that to their advantage to censor stuff .

  - Nor is there any indication that it s not a culture-bound phenomenon .
  - You were making the assertion that it is  without - as far as I know - any evidence to back it up .
  - I do nt see how you can make that assertion .
- - Even with the red circles  I was nt able to see him . I guess this just means I should nt get on any governmental bad sides
  - You can definitely see the sniper . In all of the photos  the gun barrel is pointed at the camera . Look for the black circle of the barrel .

  - A who with the what  Nah  I moved after getting laid off and was pretty horribly depressed  so I made a big mess of the whole thing .

  - They are friends of the US so hard to bomb them .
- - Send it thru teleport for some ham and cheese cause im hungry .
