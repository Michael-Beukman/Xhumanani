- - Why did the long string get a shorter representation and the short string a longer one  Makes no sense . The whole question here is also very dubious .

  - By that logic  I redact my statement . I see what you mean  the fart is nt flammable  but the methane gas being expelled is .
- - Plumlee is fucking awful . Zero spacial awareness . Who tries to take a fucking charge that far under the rim  Plumlee ...
  - Plumlee does . Plumlee also tries to block threes by jumping over people .

- - What are you looking at that those are your suggestions 
  - I do nt know  This was on the Huff post tech blog which I follow

  - What would you do with so many of them 
- - It would produce sperm that causes weight loss  id be getting dome left right and centre .
  - yeah  but only from fat chicks .
  - You could nt keep it going with the same girl either . Unless you re into anorexia i guess .

  - This  but would be quite ok if it worked only when someone gets disconnect not kick .
- - Moss is adorable though . I d date him .
  - But unfortunately  you see  I was essentially Napoleon Dynamite with Moss s afro .

  - To make it green . It looks green without the UV light as well .

- - Do you jump solo yet Ms. Goddess 
  - Huh  Are you talking about skydiving  I ve been jumping for years ...
- - These are not the situations conducive to our chucking style of offense . It s hard to go for broke when a mistake can be so costly .
  - Yall are a balanced offense . Maybe not this game  but overall  yall are very balanced .
- - Do you know if they make it not pre-made  I feel like it could be so much cheaper if I could buy it in powder form .
  - Im pretty sure it does  I ve never tried it tho .
- - i do nt think most cops will pull you over just for not having a front plate
  - Our MHP loves pulling people over for this  in the middle of town  in the daytime  in heavy traffic .
- - This was well said . Permit me though  to ask  would heterosexuality be considered sin  then  Would everything be considered sin 
  - Heterosexuals are sinners . Homosexuals are sinners . For all are sinners and have fallen short of God s glory .
- - Unfortunately yes  but under these circumstances Valve tend to let you off considering you technically did nt make the trade yourself .
  - Oh ok . Still would LOVE my items back considering I had a knife .

  - Pop of colour for lips or cheeks is easy enough I think 
  - Alright  Thanks for the suggestion and the confirmation . Will keep you posted

- - I hate you . I have TWO college degrees and I barely make a third of that .
  - Sorry man  im sure it will pay off eventually 
- - With videos  it s harder to put the punchline in the title than with something like comics or macros . Yet OP managed to do it here .
  - Not sure of trolling ... I pretty much just copied the video title
  - People get butthurt about that around here . Do nt worry  I still enjoyed that
  - Haha thank you . Yeah I did nt realize me doing that was the equivalent of me killing a child . I ll watch out for that next time
- - I think this looks awesome  I love the redesign .
  - Me too . And a tad more practical than the older costume  perhaps .
- - The standard edition was removed from the store . I wanted to buy that too and i m not paying that price for a game with season pass .
  - The gold edition does nt work either . I own the gold edition and I ca nt play it due to some licensing thing .
- - Not to mention the DeLorean is very off perspective .
  - And it s plowed into a goddamn curb .
- - Not going to lie  the elise skin looks great .
  - the spider reminds me of the spiders from zelda

- - White people . He means white people  because he s a racist .
  - Oh  I know . I wanted to see how long he would go with the blood and soil poetics before he admitted it .
- - Nope . Gran was not much of a cook . Refrigerator soup was a particularly terrifying prospect  lol But the mac  cheese and tomato dish really was pretty good .
  - I feel like you were cheated . For most  going to see grandma also meant a big meal accompanied by fresh cookies . What the heck is fridge soup 
- - A snickers . My inner diva was silenced .
  - Good to know you re yourself again .
- - I m going to call bullshit on at least one of them  that s Thierry Henry on the bike
  - Glad to see im not the only one who thought that
- - Incorrect . Unless im the former head of HR and i do nt know it yet . Pm me your informants names in future and I ll discreetly follow up
  - You are  you have been replaced by DHD .
- - Did VG ever clear things up with their techies pick  What the fuck was that about 
  - Yeah I wasnt paying enough attention to see if it was a random or not .
- - Sure no problem  I want to offer more but need to get more keys sorry mate .
  - That s ok  you can add items if you want .
- - All the stupid arguments aside the man killed one endangered animal . Hippies need to calm the hell down . It s just a single wolf . Just an animal .
  - Should ve been the other way around IMO . Wolves are endangered . There are plenty of people . What s one less 
- - Ask him for a refund  but tell him your intensions .
  - Thanks  but I just ended up manually adding the settings to the pro version and uninstalling the free version .
- - Take this as you will . Rumor was that he has been trying to get back into playing shape ... maybe he is close to a return 
  - Well he tweeted the other day that the chiefs had given him a call . Very possible it is relation to that .
- - Are you my ex boyfriend  you sound like my ex boyfriend .
  - Unlikely but I do say that to my girlfriend sometimes . Does that mean she s going to break up with me 
  - He s the one who broke up with me ... so theres that ...

- - I m going to have to move on to Classic then .
  - Maybe they will reopen enrollment for classic 
- - Is it possible that the score you get influences the drop rate .
  - Nah  I tried that also  but still RNG .
- - You must be in a nice area of a city cos that s expensive . That s like Canada prices .
  - It s definitely a very nice part of the city . We re surrounded by businesses and shopping malls and other hotels .
- - Wow i did nt realize she was so stacked . Based on what the ace man finds attractive  she really fits the bill to a T .
  - The notable info on her on IMDB says she has gigantic breasts lol .
- - Indoor romantic picnic on a rug with candles . Cook a huge range of small finger food . Kids to a sitter elsewhere or AirBnB a whole house to yourself .
  - A whole house to ourselves . Now that s me swooning .
- - following djs on facebook is also a good way . as they regularly post the new tracks they are working on .
  - The generic channels that post all tracks or most of recent tracks are also a good way  following them on youtube is a good idea
- - That video was awesome  but Faber and Jones were criminally underused .
  - Same with Mysterio . A clothesline  That s it  He s spent more of his life in the air than on the ground .
- - I ve nothing constructive to add except for you should probably be a bit more humane . Man or women .
  - Yes  this comes across as a tad robotic .
- - Who knows  perhaps someone disagrees with the way I decided to spend my credits .
  - I m sorry I m not up to date  a slave rebellion is happening in that system  What exactly does that do

  - Yeah  I was just peeping quickly and walking along  actually crawling into the stall deserved a whip .
- - the card game is more of a plot devise than a focus in that series  it focuses on characters and interactions

- - The college kids punt better than these guys .
  - He was great in college for what it s worth ... regressed a lot in the NFL though
- - Why does he care who fucks his sister  She is nt his property . Sounds like your buddy is a real cunt .

  - Yeah  but I would nt want to walk in on it .
  - But would you threaten to beat your buddy up any seen with him 
- - Do you have to draft two players  meaning do you have to cut two people before the draft  Can you cut more than two 
  - Nah just used two as example . Could also choose to draft a guy and then drop him if u do nt wan na drop any of your vets .
- - I m not sure  but can you not join a random world in the Xbox version  Check the minecraft sub . That place is packed
  - Not in the Xbox version . You can only join friends who are playing .
- - I do find myself thinking this is exactly like The Interview only the majority are cheering that an organisation are being forced to change plans due to threats .
  - Thanks for opening that idea to me .
- - yeah it s a totally ridiculous thing to report ... but still somehow makes me feel uneasy about this jabroni
  - I would nt want him . I do nt like huge name college guys .
- - I m pretty jealous . Ive wanted to get into fly tying during the winter  but I wouldnt know where to start . Also  might not have the patience 
  - It takes some patience  but it is worth it .
- - I d like to know if its less accidents but with better car safety . Todays cars can be torn to shreds and still keep the occupants alive .
  - Today s cars are built so that you do nt take the forces of the crash .
- - If you could go back in time and kick the crap out of someone from your school  who would it be 
  - The bully that made me shart myself when he scared me in gym . I hate P.E teachers
- - At the Tournament of Roses Parade singing The Auld Triangle .
  - Is that the old prison song  Tha Auld Triangle  goes jingle jangle 
- - What deck counter the face hunter deck 
  - I rarely lose to face hunter with control warrior .
- - Probably when he poisoned the kid and blamed someone else
  - Yep  you re right . That was the time .
- - Is that your bed  How are you juicing all over it .
  - Happens to me cause I always lay down and vape  put my mod down with a dripper leaks through the holes .
- - thanks . how did you find it 
  - It showed up on one of the h torrent sites I frequent awhile back . Do nt remember which one though .
- - Haha  I enjoyed reading that  Any thoughts on why they do nt believe you to be gay 
  - Because the jokes are absurd . They think I m just a straight guy giving them a hard time for being a homophobe .
- - I never knew that  Thanks . I am not to good with Gunpla so these are perfect .
  - Amen  I suck at gunpla to . Dont know why i still do them
- - Pretty impressed there was never one in Indonesia or the Red Sea
  - There probably were  just not large enough to be on this map .
- - My mom s house is paid off .
  - That does nt mean she is nt looking at mortgaging it .

  - She could probably actually do this one 
- - I think they sprayed some pepper extract on some of the fruits since the kids were eating it . I could be wrong .

  - Surviving the titanic  There was a lot of money on that ship .
- - First pic got me thinking this was tsundere planes .
  - It s not like I wanted you to fly me ... Baka .
- - This only started happening to me when I had QuickCast on  is this coincidence or do other people in this thread use quickcast too 
  - I m experiencing this without ever using QuickCast .
- - Fiction is the genre  science is the label . Movies are entertainment . If you watch them expecting hyper realism then you re just looking for something to complain about .
  - I ll complain about the straw men you re throwing around though .
- - Oh thank God . Ive been pulling hair .
  - Also  HPV goes away by itself after a while . It s not a permanent one .

  - thats cool  hope you have a happy new year 
- - hmm what about having like pictures of bases that can be done with certain strategies and pictures of bases that are ca nt be done with a certain strategy 
  - I was thinking of taking attacks from wars we are in of failed attacks to show bases not to attack lol
- - Wrong  they float in the blood of my enemy ... whisky .
  - And there is only one way to defeat this enemy ... by drinking it .
- - Our babies are birthday twins  And it s my birthday too  It s a great day to be born .
  - Yay  Happy birthday to you and your baby  I was planning on a Capricorn baby  so now I have to learn all about raising a tiny Sagittarius 
- - We re renting the house currently  and hoping to buy from him . He s also the owner .
  - Ok I get it now I was a bit confused lol . Good luck 
- - If you ve never been drunk  do nt bash people who do . Some people like it because it is very fun for them .
  - I m not bashing anyone . How can that be fun  Leaving yourself vulnerable and inebriated  Physically deprived of control  Sounds  I do nt know  stupid 
- - Why did nt that girl in the middle strip as well 
  - Seriously  You really think that s a girl  ... It s obviously a cat .

- - No lol  he s still undrafted . I wish he was a Leaf .
  - oh  you got my hopes up and then quickly dashed them . Good show
- - I like your cat . Does he hang around while you play  My dog is my biggest and only fan .
  - He and his brother do nt mind guitar  but totally freak out whenever drums are played .
- - Looking forward to this  as a beginner do I just follow the beginner s starting stretch routine or the specific splitting routine 
  - I would say you need to do the splits in order to do this pose  particularly your middle splits .
- - I think that it is nt really something to get into for the money  . Startup costs are high and the learning curve is steep .
  - A steep learning curve means you learn a lot quickly . Do you mean a slow learn curve  where it takes a long time to increase your knowledge 
- - Come on kings help slide us into the playoffs
  - You re in the playoff right now thi

  - I m not even sure where that is  I live in ny so the Hanover  pa thing confused me a bit lol .
- - Undertaker vs Lesnar sticks out in my mind as one of the worst things I ve ever seen in my life .
  - Kinda hard to put on any sort of good performance when you get concussed pretty early one .
- - At the time they were just looking for incentives for people to go to NMZ not knowing that it would become the best combat training method .
  - then they re idiots for not even considering that  its like they do nt even play the game sometimes and the bug fixer does jack .
- - hmm am in Bentley  kent st. area  I live on Curtin University campus
  - Living at Curtin you do nt want to spend much on a bike if you plan to park it around campus . Bikes are always getting stolen there 
- - Thank you for thinking logically about this . Everyone seems to view it as an all or nothing  which is highly unlikely .
  - NOPE IT CA NT BE KOREAN NOPE NOPE NOPE
- - Expected . Your ex moves on and forms a new relationship . Unexpected . He is a member of a death metal band whose theme is raping dead babies .
  - Wow . She might use the same dating service as Mama June . Sorry  man .

  - Do what I just did and unsubscribe .
- - I m not sure about that  but the cold water reduces the heat created by the friction .
  - Interesting  i wonder why they wrap a hot towel around your face when they give you a cut throat .
- - Because it s a game and why the fuck not .
  - Precisely this . Why do people have a problem with it is my question .
- - They said it would be released in a special way  think you have to accomplish a goal or something . That s what I remember . . S
  - It should be you need to prove you own it before you can use it .
- - ehhh Im kind of looking for one with MW type looks . I can pay extra depending on looks Its gon na be a personal AWP
  - Ah okay . That s the only one I have so  let me know if it s good enough or if you d like to offer on it .
- - Oh okay  thank you and sorry for the misunderstanding 
  - No problem . BTW if Elsa was evil or bad leader or whatever  do you think Anna would be better on the throne  .
- - Too bad Mariota will get Bucked in the draft .
  - At least he ll be able to throw to Evans .
- - Nice  It was just sort of implied by the lack of credit given haha . Thank you .
  - No problem . Happy to clear it up .

  - If your fumbling the ball a million times that means your not good .
- - I m pretty sure that s the Shire .
  - The shire is the entire Hobbit province . Hobbiton is one of the many towns within the shire . Tolkien goes into plenty of detail on the matter . D

- - You use an app to keep track of your drinking 
  - I mean  it has fun badges and I m a simple man .
- - Enjoy watching him huff and puff around the penalty box in a strop . Small time compared to what he had laying in front of him .
  - You seem really bitter  everything ok 
- - Can only think that s the reason why MDZ has nt played  but is he a hot head  Skip practice or something  Makes no sense .
  - Maybe he called Berube out on something and it pissed him off 
- - Hue hue hue hue hue But to stay on topic  hated the Packers throwback  it made them look like walking lotto numbers ...
  - I do nt like them either  it does nt work the numbers are way too small
- - Boys will be boys . Edit . I was joking . Geez . I was making fun of the parents who say this after their little brats misbehave .
  - There s only one way to find out what point is too far amirite 
- - It could also be a crane shot  on a dolly . Thats how I ve done it before .
  - It could have been that  but unfortunately it was nt . That would have to be a pretty long  narrow crane arm to make it through the car though .
- - That is not even an event in the mod
  - Darn  i saw it on the citadel i assumed it was a copy from an event  isnt there a group of events the correlate to the drinking of wildfire
- - The SOE authentication services seem to be down . Hence why you ca nt even log into the soe website at the moment .

- - Bull of the game - Everyone Seriously I love this team so much  what a game
  - So Thibs . Got it  I need to add more options for that ... it ll come ... it ll come 
- - They did nt review that  Huh 
  - all scoring plays are reviewed  it just was nt called down because it was quickly determined there was nt enough to overturn it
- - What the fuck  am I seeing the same site  its just a shitty graphic on a tee .
  - Yeah it s not terribly original or anything  but its not ugly .
- - It s exactly what is happening to me . It s actually pretty crazy that you said that .
  - Enjoy it my friend . Its empowering . I know i am .
- - yeah  it s kind of creepy really . They go all out . Like  even her very name makes them furious
  - She is a strong independent woman that speaks her mind  of course they freak out .
- - Careful man . It is going to hurt when you fall off that soap box .

- - So I m going to ask the real question on everyone s mind  what kind of dinosaur did you become 
  - A pretty one  I m pink . Scaly . Lonely .

  - This is nt a blowout  yet ...
- - I d love to see my Perky Pug dealing with Imperator .
  - What  I ca nt hear you  I m too busy following around this damned dog who keeps stealing and burying stuff  D . . D
- - is it necessary  no . is it convenient  yes

- - This freezing weather has created some icy roads . Stay safe out there 
  - I agree  Please stay safe everyone 
- - Yeah ... I re read it and I feel like a dick reminding him of it . Poor guy . I hope the prolactin issue resolves everything .
  - Haha just joking man . I m sure he ll be fine .
- - I wonder if the guy with the stand on O  Connell street will have them  he seems to have stuff from everywhere .
  - That s absolutely worth a try  great call  thank you
- - Are you thinking of Before Sunset  It s written and directed by the same guy who made Boyhood and it all takes place in one evening .
  - That s all that came up with my google searches and I have already seen the whole Before  trilogy and really liked them all . Thanks for the suggestion though 
- - I think the hardest part about a break-up is learning how to be happy alone again . Sometimes I still struggle with it when I truly am alone .
  - definitely a big problem for me right now .
- - Uh  that s Moen  not Cole . It s even more impressive than you stated .
  - Im becoming more impressed by the millisecond 
- - That touchdown play did nt even look fair .
  - i m pretty sure the defenders they switched did nt make it off the field before the score
- - Or perhaps not even Americans . I ve never set foot in America  but I know what the flag looks like .
  - You re an honorary American now and there s nothing you can do about it
- - You know  a polar bear would probably think this looked as ridiculous as our human face swaps look to us .

  - I was hoping for one as well .
- - Better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all
  - If that was true i would nt be drinking this alcohol
- - Higher labor costs will make goods and services more expensive . Knowing that  you could say that unions are at least partially responsible for higher prices of goods and services .
  - One could spread a larger portion of corporate profit to the laborers without raising prices though .
- - Griezmann s not likely to get an upgrade . He s having a pretty shit season despite those two good games . He s not even a starter for Atltico .
  - Oh well I was just looking around at players that were young that were already on their second informs .
- - Uhhhh you do nt sound like a Christian at all
  - What do you expect a Christian to sound like  and why

  - Yeah  I ve actually been considering this with mega banette as azu actually has some really solid support moves that would make him really interesting with prankster .
- - OP  you are one lucky cunt .
  - You re OP s MIL are nt you .
- - This video is an obvious fake . Edit . I m a moron . It is real .
  - How can you tell  It seems like a lot of effort to stage something like this .
- - Are they actually chanting USA  What the fuck is this shit 
  - A country where we do nt surrender to hot air balloons
- - why do nt you just smoke the blunt 
  - Why use a pipe when you got a bong . Because it not as hot ...
- - I just want to say you re awesome for being such a caring and thoughtful person . Wishing you and your boyfriend continued happiness .
  - He makes being caring worth it . I have never cared about someone else s happiness as much as I do his . Thank you and you keep being awesome 
- - If you do nt take your Jeopardy seriously  you are a savage .
  - Amen to that . First the mental stimulation . Then ... Well  you know 
- - If nobody is around  when a door is closing  I try to quickly squeeze in without touching it  in a Indiana Jones like manner .
  - I ve tried that . I like to mix it up by making it into a slide .
- - That s not what I said at all
  - You re discouraging people from donating the way they want to donate . Who cares why they donate  As long as the money get s to the charity 
- - Oh snap  I live in SD . Moved here from texas . Love it here .
  - Sweet Man  what made you decide to move from Texas to Cali 
- - Found it amazing . A shame about the ending  but still incredible .
  - yeah the ending was unfortunate in regards to speed running  but hilarious because of how dumb it looked
- - so because gatorade is a big corporation and a team ate some bananas before they won a super bowl  gatorade is now bad for you 
  - You re good at phrasing stupid things and kind of relating them to true statements . Gatorade does nt help with cramps . Bananas do .
- - Then he stole other people s ideas and ran out on paying tesla for his services . Edison was kind of a dick .
  - Can we please stop having this every single time Edison is even mentioned
- - If I could stand it I would have made weird paths in it for my future amusement .
  - There s still time  Maybe I ll shave a picture in the other one
  - I m on pins and needles awaiting this .
  - I do nt think it ll be tonight  my ambien just kicked in  but definitely in the next few days . Watch out  world 
- - I like to lay down and such when at my desktop  but everything looks dark when I m below it . It kinda sucks .
  - I did nt even consider people lying down at their desktops  I guess you ve got a good point .
- - haha is nt that a bit extreme 
  - Meh ... got to do what you got to do . It truly is easier than taking all that time to prepare those meals individually .
- - Is it bad that I want it to stay so that any credibility OP even remotely had is gone 
  - You have a valid point I have to admit .
- - He s not a Canadian . The title is misleading and was editorialized on purpose to change it from the actual article title .
  - I agree with you . It is a sad attempt to demonize .
- - In her hair or around her wrist  Or both  Because I definitely rocked both in middle school .
  - Thankfully  she just wears them in her hair . I rocked them both in middle school too
