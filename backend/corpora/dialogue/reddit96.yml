  - Ignore him if he does nt think height plays a factor in attraction
- - As long as you re earning souls  there s no reason to stop leveling .
  - Precisely this . Soul Memory makes it so that you have no incentive to stop leveling your character .
- - That is awesome . Not the orange allergy but the dream is pretty intense .
  - Haha  thanks  Once I also dreamed that my stepdad turned into a creepy yellow helicopter with eyes and landed in my backyard . My dreams are pretty trippy .
- - It s already on the front page . P
  - doh  I searched too . Sorry for reposting 
- - Last day of leave and then it s back to NC . Anyone know if I can catch UFC inside LAX somewhere

  - Ah completely understandable  some things are meant to be left unfinished sometimes
- - If you do nt think subtle mental game has nothing to do with it  you know nothing of sports .
  - right ... that has to be it  I mean  that s exactly what I was talking about  right 
- - Were Jews illegally crossing into Germany to slurp welfare and commit crimes too

  - It s not . It s not a struggle  it s not anything but a judgement .

  - Your cowardly back peddle makes my stomach turn with anger . I m going to have a cup of tea to calm down .

- - Wow . Fiji sounds amazing . Thanks for replying 
  - Your welcome kinda fun going through memory lane .
- - You can slightly see how it may resemble a modern Porsche car  weird how some design characteristics permanently stick to the culture of a business and it s father .
  - But it does nt look like the VW Beetle at all 
- - God  I loved those space pants .
  - Late reply . Yeah they re a favourite of mine too  To the point where I ve had to shop in women s stores to look for that dang print .
- - Drug counselor Had someone quit drugs  got their life together and joined our staff

  - Great  Thanks a bunch  It hatched shiny and everything .
- - Ok thanks . This is my first day Im a little lost but thanks .
  - That s ok. We re all new at some point .
- - I thought subs themselves have bots to give you notice when your posts are removed to give you some context or ... justification ...  thx
  - Some do  some do nt . Very few make their moderation actions public to the community as a whole even when they do notify individual posters .
- - I prefer GIMP  but I m lazy and paint is sufficient
  - I like Paint.NET because the interface is easy to use  but you can get unlimited features with plugins .

  - Thank you  I m sure yours will be glorious 
- - TIL OP was actually Jabba the Hutt s creepy female roleplay account
  - Your opinion of me  formed after lurking through my post history  has nothing to do with the post . Move along  loser .
- - Anyone know if Gibson is supposed to stay in the AHL until the playoffs  I remember hearing something like that  but I m not sure

  - Nope  what better solution to alcoholism than more booze 
- - What the fuck   That s like  oh yeah  sorry about that  but  fuck you .
  - He was so fast we could nt keep up ...

  - yes  if this is rolled out to every one on twitter  then we can expect some more people getting addicted to twitter checking the missed stories .
- - Congratulations on forming the closest resembling nation to the first US . I imagine you and the Republic of America will have a problem with each other 
  - They are now the Republic of the Great Lakes
- - To clarify the latch on the customers glove box is broken . I guess this was his fix .
  - I owned one of these  and it took me a few sec to realize what the hell this guy was trying to accomplish .
  - I had one  and recognized immediately what was going on . Loved the way it drove  but what a POS .
  - Yeah  mine was a money pit before I sold it .
- - fucktard . i can do this too . I love how random people can just post something hours later when they have no involvement in the initial issue .

- - A removed feature . It was viewed as an exploit after seeing how people were abusing it for easy bonemeal or lapis .
  - I still get other dyes and lapis when pulverizing wool though -- just not bonemeal .
  - Right . Bonemeal was the only one removed . The odds of the other dyes were significantly reduced  sans config changes .
  - Oh ok . Thanks . Guess I ll have to find another way to get a bunch of bonemeal then .
- - I guess it probably goes without saying that the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship in Raleigh is extremely liberal .
  - However very much not Baptist or Methodist . UUs can be quite a departure from straight Christianity .
- - They re going to get WHAT d  are nt they 
  - This crowd is too dead for even that .
- - If he knows Adnan killed her it s not wrong .
  - Nope . Then it s still wrong . Lying under oath in a capital murder case is wrong .

  - I ve been in relationships like that  and I know other people with similar boundaries .
- - I m certain chuck is looking for one ... but so are a dozen other teams . It s gon na be tough to find one at a fair price .
  - Russo s recent article says Fletcher is looking for a lefty dman
- - Can we just buy Harry Kane in Jan and just bench him 
  - Would nt it be more beneficial to let him play because we have already played tottenham twice so he will score against other teams 
- - Joe Buck ... but seriously I guess Jack Buck .
  - Dude Shannon and his endearing alcoholism . also if we can dip into the past  Jack Buck was so amazing his son gets a free career out of it .
- - I certainly did nt need a looking glass to see that one ...
  - Sorry  what did you say  I lost my train of thought .
  - Well that took a dramatic turn of events
  - Now there s systematic chaos going on .

  - yeah my bad ... email me ill hook you up on the next one ...
- - Oh  No  You burnt the space 
  - I had a panicked reaction at first as if it was going to fly away and engulf some planet in flames LoL

  - Good stuff so far . Keep us posted 
- - Does everyone really think blade dancer is better than gunslinger 
  - No I usually use gunslinger but was testing out Do nt Touch Me Arms which are nt that useful in crucible
- - Thats great and all ... but i think we should be trying hard for Rubio Rubin
  - I d want him . But I d want him more getting playing time in one of the big European leagues .
- - This seems to happen to me pretty often too . Especially with longer texts . Maybe it has something to do with split messages 
  - I think the issue is when a message spans several SMS . I think a char count in the reply window would help narrow down the issue .
- - That was just awful watching you fail at mario cart
  - the controls were broken . My kart would nt steer . I have plenty of Mario Kart in Source videos where I do much better .
  - I know  I heard you  it was just so stressful watching it not work ...
  - Trust me it was very frustrating playing it .
- - Thank you for the information  Do you know if the batteries you listed are the same current draw so that they will not damage the circuit 
  - They are the same voltage  and the board will only draw as much average as it needs  so no worries there . They will work just fine .
- - Eh  I think Earl would whoop Yau in a jury vote . The Horsemen did nt like Yau at all .

- - I d be happy if they all sounded American or English or Scottish or whatever  as long as they picked one accent for a race and stuck with it .
  - The lack of consistency is stupid  true  but it did nt bother me much .
- - Pretty easy to believe it s a sim TBH

- - This is a public forum . That response does nt hold any legitimacy .
  - Cool . So you re done now 
- - I like La revolucion in fountain square much better . Same style of place  but less expensive and IMO better tacos .
  - Agreed . Less expensive  comparable food  and you can actually have a conversation there . They re both good though .
- - Wtf  Why d he do that  And good choice in unlocking without him . Subtle  but strong .
  - It s funny and all that but it s actually rather passive-aggressive . If there s a problem the best way to deal with it is to talk about it up-front .
  - This is implying that we did nt also do that . We re both adults . This is just how I blew off steam watching the clock tick to midnight .
  - Ahhh  well you had fun . I went to bed early and slept through the whole thing 
- - My head . Dear Lord . Still pretty neat though .
  - They ll attach GoPro s to anything nowadays ...

- - I hope you got all that attention you were obviously looking for .
  - Not at the time but I m reaping the rewards now 
- - okay I must ask  why is it called square priest 
  - Because it does nt have any CIRCLE of healing .

  - Also what most fatties consider too skinny is actually healthy
- - MOM  Bathroom ... Bathroom  Bathroom 
  - Make sure you rub Eric s belly before he makes bears 
- - Anyone know who he is  have a link or something 
  - According to my search results  he is Makoto Endo .
- - What sets that apart is that there are no other sounds . No soundtrack at all . So the presence of something loud is so noticeable .
  - Yeah that s a great point . I watched John Carpenter s The Ward and it was AWFUL about stupid jump scares . Y jon
- - Are you teaching modern standard arabic  or a dialect or both 
  - Both . Starting with basic MSA then would like to diversify .

  - joining a gym in the next couple of weeks . D
- - What defines a masterpiece though  Because for me  Cross Ange was a lot more fun to watch than the most hyped shows from last season .
  - If you enjoy it  that is all that matters . And I really enjoyed this more than almost everything else that was aired .
- - I do nt see a difference between the signs .
  - I feel the In and Out makes the distinction slightly more clear .
- - You can always tell someone s tired of discussing the subject at hand when they turn to unrelated politics . Good luck with the career search .

  - I love eggs  and crabs  and boiling denim and bangin hoors 
- - Sneak Peak is two weeks away . If you love opening packs  get the new stuff cause they ll have the most trade value . Or buy a deck core .

- - First time I notice that there is an ALIEN on skis in the background . O
  - Southpark is known for hiding aliens in a lot of episodes
- - I do nt have anything against the Wii U per say . I just play primarily RPGs and the Wii U does nt exactly have an extensive library .
  - no worries  it can be a negative to the wiiu but honestly I think PCs are better for rpgs anyways
- - In other words you d rather make up your story about how they felt than believe what the two people who were there said . K .

  - Don and Adnan have both described that meeting .
  - Downvoted because you ca nt deny it . Nice .
