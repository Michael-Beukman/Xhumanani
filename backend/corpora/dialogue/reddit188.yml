- - Fingered my sloppy joe  Have nt heard that one before . I like .
  - Yeah I m definitely putting that one in my pocket for later .

  - Found it in a buddy s old stash box
- - I thought I was watching a football game  not a comedy .
  - Or a tragedy if you re watching in Florida .
- - I just brought a car with a heated steering wheel . May be the greatest option ever . It is the best feeling on a cold morning .

  - He does nt seem like the kind of guy who would partake . I am just hoping he does nt mind that i continue smoking in the house .

  - It s ok . Some people can detect satire and it s alright if you want to admit it .
- - Yeah Dave got it removed last year . That ca nt be Dave
  - He had that weird condition where a small part of his forehead sucked in all visible light though
- - So  is this guy going to wear Darth Vader s helmet  Because that would be a really badass way to bring back the visage of Vader .
  - Would be pretty lame if you ask me
- - Rules clarification . Is putting a card onto the battlefield the same as casting a creature 
  - It s a broader term than casting . It includes both casting  and cheating it in with effects like elvish piper .
- - Just me or does the left one look prego 
  - Standing sideways  leaning backwards  turning to the right . All coming together creating an illusion or rather empowering the line of her belly .
- - actually a little wrong on that TAS runs are ussually as flashy as possible because it would be really boring if they never did cool stuff
  - Usually flashy and fast which is the trick
- - I do nt think it s him . If it was  he would have confirmed it using his alt .
  - I used to read his stuff all the time and it sounds just like him . If it is nt him it s a really good impersonator .
- - I m afraid to click that . What s in there 
  - It s like gonewild  but instead of girls  you have avocados . It s just for comedic value  with scandalous titles  but not nsfw content
- - It s nice to see Batum with dat confidence again . The past four or five games have looked more like old Nic .
  - Yeah . I think he s back . Not a moment too soon with all these injuries .

  - He is hardly better this year  also melo is still in his prime  look at his knee issues for his lack of performance

- - Reported . This is not evidence but speculation .
  - Sure you can take it as that .
- - The single player is quick and leaves you with a feeling of regret after you ve beat it . I definitely recommend giving the co-op a try .
  - And if you ca nt seem to find the co-op version  you can always pay-to-win .
  - I heard the pay to win version has viruses though .
  - You also have a chance of catching a virus during coop . The trick is knowing how to avoid viruses while enjoying the game .
- - Comedy  as a genre  does nt travel well .
  - Very true . South Korean comedy is grating for me at best ... I m sure plenty would say the same about things I think are funny as well .

- - what genre  can u give me some details 
  - It s a cartoon themed online racer with customizing and open-world elements .
- - They could be using folded legs as a kind of wind screen to reduce loading on grid fins when they deploy at supersonic . But it does seem odd .
  - Grid fins work fine at fast supersonic and hypersonic speeds . They are not in need of protection .
- - I never said we were more diverse than they were . Reread my comment plox
  - Why would I expect you to contradict a tautology  I am contending a statistic not the negation of a self evident statement .

  - Hope you have photos . That would help .

  - The men knew the risks . May their sacrifice result in new recruits for the Green Dawn global takeover . Over .
- - Because people still do drugs . I do nt care if you do them  but it is good to educate people about the effects they have .
  - Meh  problem with that is that their effects are never honestly described in schools .
- - Yes a total joke . I love them .
  - Ha I figured  but now that I ve been baptized  I ca nt help but preach .
- - Whatever you felt for Amy  she apparently did nt feel it . Or not enough to decide to meet up with you again . Sorry man .
  - Thanks for your reply . You are probably right .
- - But the second example  the one about the Jewish men being killed in the hundreds by Muhammed s followers  that s not a lie . Right 
  - Treason is a death sentence into the modern age .
